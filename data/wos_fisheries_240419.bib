Abstract = {Seagrass ecosystems are diminishing worldwide and repeated studies
   confirm a lack of appreciation for the value of these systems. In order
   to highlight their value we provide the first discussion of seagrass
   meadows as a coupled social-ecological system on a global scale. We
   consider the impact of a declining resource on people, including those
   for whom seagrass meadows are utilised for income generation and a
   source of food security through fisheries support. Case studies from
   across the globe are used to demonstrate the intricate relationship
   between seagrass meadows and people that highlight the multi-functional
   role of seagrasses in human wellbeing. While each case underscores
   unique issues, these examples simultaneously reveal social-ecological
   coupling that transcends cultural and geographical boundaries. We
   conclude that understanding seagrass meadows as a coupled
   social-ecological system is crucial in carving pathways for social and
   ecological resilience in light of current patterns of local to global
   environmental change. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Ostrom proposed the underpinnings of a framework for the systematic
   study of the governance of complex social-ecological systems. Here we
   hypothesize that Ostrom's social-ecological system framework can be
   useful to build a classification system for small-scale benthic
   fisheries, regarding their governance processes and outcomes. The
   purpose of this paper is to contribute to knowledge accumulation of
   benthic fisheries. To tailor the framework, we relied on discussions
   among experts and a systematic literature review of benthic fisheries
   from 1980 to 2010. This literature review helped us refine variable
   definitions and provide readers with illustrative reference papers. We
   then illustrate the approach and its potential contributions through two
   studies of the emergence of self-organization in Mexico and Chile. We
   highlight synthetic lessons from the cases and the overall approach as
   well as reflect on remaining challenges to the development of a
   social-ecological system framework as a diagnostic tool for knowledge
   accumulation and synthesis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Interactions Between Spatially Explicit Conservation and Management
   Measures: Implications for the Governance of Marine Protected Areas},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {52},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1355-1368},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Marine protected areas are not established in an institutional and
   governance vacuum and managers should pay attention to the wider
   social-ecological system in which they are immersed. This article
   examines Islas Choros-Damas Marine Reserve, a small marine protected
   area located in a highly productive and biologically diverse coastal
   marine ecosystem in northern Chile, and the interactions between human,
   institutional, and ecological dimensions beyond those existing within
   its boundaries. Through documents analysis, surveys, and interviews, we
   described marine reserve implementation (governing system) and the
   social and natural ecosystem-to-be-governed. We analyzed the
   interactions and the connections between the marine reserve and other
   spatially explicit conservation and/or management measures existing in
   the area and influencing management outcomes and governance. A top-down
   approach with poor stakeholder involvement characterized the
   implementation process. The marine reserve is highly connected with
   other spatially explicit measures and with a wider social-ecological
   system through various ecological processes and socio-economic
   interactions. Current institutional interactions with positive effects
   on the management and governance are scarce, although several potential
   interactions may be developed. For the study area, any management action
   must recognize interferences from outside conditions and consider some
   of them (e.g., ecotourism management) as cross-cutting actions for the
   entire social-ecological system. We consider that institutional
   interactions and the development of social networks are opportunities to
   any collective effort aiming to improve governance of Islas Choros-Damas
   marine reserve. Communication of connections and interactions between
   marine protected areas and the wider social-ecological system (as
   described in this study) is proposed as a strategy to improve
   stakeholder participation in Chilean marine protected areas.},

Title = {The Chilika Lagoon Social-Ecological System: An Historical Analysis},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Innovations in social-ecological research require novel approaches to
   conceive change in human-environment systems. The study of history
   constitutes an important element of this process. First, using the
   Chilika Lagoon small-scale fisheries in India, as a case, in this paper
   I reflect on the appropriateness of a social-ecological perspective for
   understanding economic history. Second, I examine here how changes in
   various components of the lagoon's social-ecological system influenced
   and shaped economic history and the political processes surrounding it.
   I then discuss the two-way linkages between economic history and
   social-ecological processes to highlight that the components of a
   social-ecological system, including the economic aspects, follow an
   interactive and interdependent trajectory such that their combined
   impacts have important implications for human-environment connections
   and sustainability of the system as a whole. Social, ecological,
   economic, and political components of a system are interlinked and may
   jointly contribute to the shaping of specific histories. Based on this
   synthesis, I offer insights to move beyond theoretical, methodological,
   and disciplinary boundaries as an overarching approach, an inclusive
   lens, to study change in complex social-ecological systems.},

Title = {Ecologically sustainable but unjust? Negotiating equity and authority in
   common-pool marine resource management},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Under appropriate conditions, community-based fisheries management can
   support sound resource stewardship, with positive social and
   environmental outcomes. Evaluating indigenous peoples' involvement in
   commercial sea cucumber and geoduck fisheries on the central coast of
   British Columbia, Canada, we found that the current social-ecological
   system configuration is relatively ecologically sustainable according to
   stock assessments. However, the current system also results in perceived
   inequities in decision-making processes, harvesting allocations, and
   socioeconomic benefits. As a result, local coastal resource managers
   envision a transformation of sea cucumber and geoduck fisheries
   governance and management institutions. We assessed the potential
   robustness of the proposed institutions using Elinor Ostrom's
   common-pool resource design principles. Grounded in the region's legal,
   political, and historical context, our analysis suggests that greater
   local involvement in these invertebrate fisheries and their management
   could provide more benefits to local communities than the status quo
   while maintaining an ecologically sustainable resource. Our research
   highlights the importance of explicitly addressing historical context
   and equity considerations in social-ecological system analyses and when
   renegotiating the institutions governing common-pool resources.},

   social-ecological resilience lens. In assessing why `` fishery may rhyme
   with poverty{''}, Christophe B n suggests a typology of impoverishment
   processes, which includes economic exclusion, social marginalization,
   class exploitation, and political disempowerment as key mechanisms that
   accelerate poverty. We extend his analysis by exploring these four
   mechanisms further and by intertwining them with processes of
   environmental change and degradation. Our goal is to understand poverty
   in local fisheries as a process rooted in social and institutional
   factors as influenced by ecological dynamics. We argue that
   understanding poverty will require a focus on the social-ecological
   system (SES) as a whole, and addressing poverty will mean rebuilding not
   only collapsed stocks but the entire social-ecological system, including
   restoring relationships between resources and people. Information from
   two cases, the Chilika Lagoon on the Bay of Bengal in India, and the
   Paraty region on the southeastern coast of Brazil, is used to understand
   how fishery social-ecological systems come under pressure from drivers
   at multiple levels, resulting in a range of impacts and pushing the
   system to a breaking point or collapse. We analyze elements of what it
   takes for the whole system to break down or collapse and push fishers
   into poverty and marginalization. The Chilika SES has already broken
   down, and the Paraty SES is under pressure from multiple drivers of
   change. The two cases help contrast key dynamics in the social,
   cultural, economic, political, and environmental spheres, for lessons on
   system collapse and recovery. Rebuilding fisheries may be examined as a
   process of building and strengthening resilience. The challenge is to
   make the fishery social-ecological system more resilient, with more
   flexibility and options, not only within fishing activities but also
   within a range of other sectors.},

Abstract = {Effective management of recreational fishing requires understanding
   fishers and their actions. These actions constitute critical links
   between social and ecological systems that result in outcomes that
   feedback and influence recreational fishers' actions and the management
   of these actions. Although much research exists on recreational fishers
   and their actions, this research is often disconnected from management
   issues. One way to help to overcome this disconnect is to illustrate how
   past research on the social component of recreational fishing fits
   within an emerging coupled social-ecological system (SES) framework.
   Herein, a conceptual SES is first developed with specific attention to
   recreational fisheries. This SES is then used to illustrate the
   importance of considering human dimensions research for articulating,
   studying and ultimately managing key outcomes of recreational fisheries
   (e.g. fish population conservation, fisher well-being) using the example
   of harvest regulations and a brief review of past interdisciplinary
   research on recreational fishing. The article ends by identifying key
   research needs including understanding: how factors such as management
   rules affect the diversity of actions by recreational fishers; how
   governance and management approaches adapt to changing social and
   resource conditions; and how recreational fishers learn and share
   information.},

Abstract = {In this essay, we explore the idea that slow social change may cause
   degradation of the open access equilibrium in recreational fisheries. An
   existing bioeconomic model illustrates how three social quantities in
   the recreational fisheries social-ecological system-the marginal cost of
   fishing effort, catchability, and the relative importance of catch and
   effort to angler utility-influence equilibrium fish abundance. We
   speculate that slow directional changes in all three of these quantities
   may be common, driving gradual declines in abundance that may be
   difficult to detect. We present limited evidence in support of this
   speculation, highlight the need for further empirical work, and discuss
   the implications of slow social change for resilient management of
   recreational fisheries in a changing world.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem-based Fisheries Management is a holistic management approach
   that integrates the dynamics of an entire ecosystem, including societal
   dimensions. However, this approach seldom lives up to its promise
   because economic and social objectives are rarely specified. To fill
   this gap, we explored how an ecosystem model could better integrate
   economic and social objectives, using the coral reef ecosystem around
   Hawai`i as a case study. After meeting with stakeholders and conducting
   a literature review of policy/strategy documents, we identified societal
   and ecological objectives and associated performance indicators for
   which data existed. We developed a social-ecological system conceptual
   framework to illustrate the relationships between ecological and social
   state components. This framework was the foundation for the development
   of the final social-ecological system model which we simulated using an
   Ecopath with Ecosim model. We simulated four gear/species restrictions
   for the reef-based fishery, two fishing scenarios associated with the
   opening of hypothetical no-take Marine Protected Areas for the
   deepwater-based fishery, and a Constant Effort (No Action) scenario.
   Despite limitations in the model, our approach shows that when social
   and economic objectives and social-ecological relationships are defined,
   we can quantify the trade-offs among the identified societal objectives
   to support managers in choosing among alternative interventions.},

Abstract = {This study aims to explore the use of the social-ecological system (SES)
   in tourism of a mountain area. Authors examined residents' perceptions
   of tourism impacts on four SES aspects: ecosystems, local knowledge,
   people and technology and property rights institutions. The aim is to
   find area that will be a ``common ground{''} for community and area that
   can be a source of conflict and will require additional work to solve
   the differences. Second objective was to examine residents' perception
   towards future local development tourism policies (winter tourism,
   seasonality and environment and culture) and how those policies can
   affect natural, socio-economic and cultural aspects of mountain area.
   Residents' perceptions of sustainable tourism development potential,
   perceived tourism impacts, analysis of community attachment and
   employment sector of stakeholder were involved in this study. The
   authors applied the Q-methodology, as one SES-allied approach, in a
   small mountain community of Kopaonik, the Republic of Serbia. The
   results revealed that residents' agreement/disagreement is connected
   with two aspects: ecosystem and property rights and that ecosystem can
   be significantly influenced by all three development policies. Findings
   suggest that development of future natural conservation plans and new
   cultural attractions can have positive effects on all parts of
   social-ecological system. Some practical implications of those findings
   for tourism planning and development are also discussed.},

Title = {Traditional Ecological Knowledge Supports Ecosystem-Based Management in
   Disturbed Coastal Marine Social-Ecological Systems},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {SEP 19},
Abstract = {A growing number of studies suggest a participatory ecosystem approach
   to support decision-making toward resilience and sustainability in
   social-ecological systems. Social-ecological resilience (SER) principles
   and practices are recommended to manage natural crises. However, it is
   necessary to broaden our understanding of SER on human-induced
   disturbances driven by economic development projects. In this paper we
   present the social-ecological system of Araca Bay (Brazil), a
   small-scale fishery community that has experienced successive
   disturbances due to development projects since the 1930s. There was a
   lack of studies about the impacts of development projects in this bay.
   As part of a major project that aimed to build an ecosystem-based
   management plan for Araca Bay through a participatory planning process,
   we focused on investigating fishers' traditional ecological knowledge
   (TEK) to understand Araca Bay's small-scale fisheries social-ecological
   system. The objectives were to: (1) investigate fishers' TEK regarding
   management practices and linked social mechanisms, human-induced
   disturbances and their consequences for the social-ecological system,
   ecosystem goods and services, and future threats; and (2) provide
   information based on TEK to the participatory planning process and
   analyze its contribution to Araca Bay's ecosystem-based management plan.
   Combined methods were used during 3 years of intense research-action
   (2014-2017): in-depth ethno-oceanographic interviews with expert
   fishers; monitoring Araca Bay participatory meetings; and participant
   observation. Genuine local practices and social mechanisms from
   traditional culture were recorded, as well as TEK about 57 target fish
   species and methods to protect habitats and natural resources. Fishers
   also reported ecosystem disturbances and recovery processes. TEK was
   codified through SWOT analysis to assist the participatory planning
   process. Ecosystem services and threats based on TEK were brought to the
   participatory process, acknowledged by the participants, and
   incorporated into the management plan. TEK analysis proved to be an
   important methodology to provide historical environmental data regarding
   the impacts of development projects and support planning in disturbed
   ecosystems. In order to support coastal marine ecosystem-based
   management strategies toward SER and sustainability, researchers and
   practitioners should consider traditional territories in planning,
   recognize local practices and social mechanisms, and consider TEK on
   ecosystem goods and services and on historical human-induced
   disturbances.},

Title = {Measuring squid fishery governance efficacy: a social-ecological system
   analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Pages = {21-57},
Abstract = {As finfish fisheries increasingly shrink due to overexploitation,
   management and industry have shifted their attention to the world's
   squid fisheries. The emergence of squid fisheries in the global seafood
   market calls for well-designed and effective management strategies if
   they are to remain viable. This study assesses the efficacy of squid
   governance from a social-ecological perspective in three fisheries. This
   analysis uses an evidence-based approach to characterize the
   social-ecological system variables that contribute to each fishery
   management system meeting its stated goals. To do so, I test the
   hypothesis that the presence of the ten institutional design principles
   formulated by common pool resource theory leads to more effective squid
   fishery management. I measure five outcome variables (governance system
   effect, commons condition trend, basin switch, user group well-being,
   compliance) to assess governance effectiveness from social and
   ecological perspectives. This is the first attempt to examine the design
   principles and operationalize Ostrom's Social-Ecological System
   framework to compare globally competitive squid fisheries. Results
   indicate that each of the three analyzed squid governance systems has
   met its specified management goals and is associated with positive
   social and ecological outcomes. Using the Socio-Ecological Systems
   Meta-Analysis Database (SESMAD), I used secondary data supplemented with
   semi-structured interviews with key informants to find a strong presence
   of the design principles in each case. Findings suggest effective squid
   governance is associated with user-involvement in system operations and
   contextually appropriate policies, rather than a single overarching
   squid based strategy.},

Abstract = {Natural resource sustainability depends on adaptive capacity: the latent
   ability of a social-ecological system to rely on or implement effective
   strategies to cope with disturbances. We propose and implement a new
   three-step framework for studying a social-ecological system's adaptive
   capacity that consists of assessment, strategy identification, and
   activation. We apply this framework to analyze the adaptive capacity of
   the Monterey Bay wetfish fisheries community in response to a
   significant stressor in the system: El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
   We conducted 49 semi-structured interviews with participants engaged in
   these fisheries and/or providing ENSO information. Of the 67
   social-ecological strategies identified through a literature review, we
   found 42 contribute to high adaptive capacity to ENSO. The most
   influential strategies were matching formal and informal rules to system
   dynamics, diversifying livelihoods, enhancing economic safety nets,
   social learning, and accessing early warning systems. Our findings
   suggest approaches for enhancing adaptive capacity in other resource
   systems.},

Abstract = {The paper contributes to the social-ecological systems literature by
   adapting and using Elinor Ostrom's Social-Ecological System (SES)
   framework in the context of a coastal ecosystem. We modified the SES
   framework in the case of the Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta (CGSM), an
   estuarine lagoon in the Caribbean coast of Colombia. The ecological
   importance of CGSM and its species is undeniable. This paper aims to
   understand why collective action for a sustainable use of CGSM's fishery
   resources has not taken place. In order to respond to that question, we
   created new variables within the social, economic, and political
   settings of the SES framework. The results show that the fishers' fear
   of the indiscriminate and strong violence that illegal armed groups have
   inflicted on them since the 1960s and the economic development in the
   Colombian Caribbean region help explain the lack of collective action.},

Volume = {12},

Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {Understanding changes over historical timescales is essential to gauge
   conservation status of a species. Modern ecological data typically
   neglect past magnitudes of change, which fortunately can be evaluated by
   bridging disparate knowledge sources. We synthesized zooarchaeological,
   historical, traditional, and western science knowledge to document
   changes in relative abundance of key species in Canada's northern
   abalone social-ecological system (SES) from the Holocene to present.
   Integrated models fit to traditional and western science data revealed
   3.7\% annual population decline from 1940s to 2010s for large abalone,
   although traditional knowledge density estimates were 9.5x higher than
   those derived from western science. Abalone are presently scarce
   compared to the mid-1900s, but more abundant than before the early
   1800s, calling their endangered status into question. Linking multiple
   knowledge sources can build SES understanding, facilitate power sharing,
   and support ecologically sustainable and socially just conservation

Title = {Understanding social-ecological change and transformation through
   community perceptions of system identity},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {We developed an empirical approach to consider social-ecological system
   change and transformation by drawing on resource users' knowledge and
   perceptions. We applied this approach in the Cau Hai lagoon, a coastal
   area dominated by small-scale fisheries in central Vietnam. Nine focus
   groups with more than 70 fishers were used to gather information about
   key social-ecological system elements and interactions, historical
   social-ecological dynamics, and possible thresholds between distinct
   social-ecological system identities. The patterns of change in
   livelihoods and resource exploitation in the Cau Hai lagoon are similar
   to those seen in other coastal lagoon and small-scale fishery contexts.
   Our findings show some promise for the use of local knowledge and the
   perceptions of resource user communities to understand and characterize
   social-ecological transformations. Importantly, however, we also
   demonstrate how social-ecological transformations are complicated
   processes driven by many factors beyond the control of any singular
   individual or group. We argue that (1) the occurrence of
   social-ecological transformations can result in either positive or
   negative outcomes and (2) that we need to direct our thinking away from
   drawing tidy conclusions about if and when social-ecological
   transformations take place. Our research also encourages scholars to
   carefully consider how we frame the benefits of participatory,
   community-based governance initiatives. Importantly, we need to examine
   the ways that governance initiatives will be beneficial for some people
   and detrimental for others, and we need to be fully aware of locally
   contested interests and acknowledge competing priorities for fisheries
   management and human well-being. Community-oriented assessments informed
   by resilience thinking can help to open up questions about economic,
   political, cultural, and environmental aspects of undesirable path
   dependencies and traps.},

Abstract = {This research examines how the Kandozi indigenous group governs access
   to fish and timber for sale and evaluates their perceptions of
   sustainability of those natural resources. The Kandozi occupy a
   biodiverse tropical forest in the northern Peruvian Amazon with lakes
   and seasonally flooded areas. Qualitative methods and a comparative
   examination of access to resources were used to explore current
   processes that shape access and the people's perceptions of their
   benefit from natural resources. Results indicated that environmental
   heterogeneity, kinship, land tenure, the legal framework, and knowledge
   all shaped access with some differences due to the dissimilar natures of
   fish and timber. This research concludes that the sustainability of this
   and similar systems are dependent upon the moment at which the analysis
   is done, because of the changing needs of people over time, in addition
   to changes in external factors and the natural variations that occur in
   the resources used. The range of relations and interactions among
   different processes that shape access, and the historically contingent
   characteristic of access and its evolution over time, help better
   understand the complexity of a given social-ecological system.},

Abstract = {Conducting social-ecological system (SES) research in fisheries aimed at
   aiding the implementation of a management plan that achieves sustainable
   outcomes remains a significant challenge. Using the Ostrom (2009) {[}1]
   diagnostic SES framework is widely utilized and acknowledged as an
   integral tool for research on SESs. The purpose of this article is to
   highlight and illustrate a comprehensive and holistic protocol for
   operationalizing SES framework research and development for adaptively
   managing small-scale fisheries. The conceptual approach, displayed in an
   illustrative framework, and article structure are framed around the
   following six key steps: (1) contextually updating the SES framework,
   (2) classify the fishery with the updated framework, (3) indentify and
   analyze data gaps and as many system component interactions as possible,
   (4) recognize multiple outcomes, (5) develop an adaptive management
   plan, and (6) implement the management plan and monitor the system. The
   illustrative conceptual approach additionally integrates stakeholder
   involvement and system feedbacks. The implementation and support for
   each step is elaborated on along with exemplary literature relating to
   the specific case studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Generalized modeling of empirical social-ecological systems},
Journal = {NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {30},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Modeling social-ecological systems is difficult due to the complexity of
   ecosystems and of individual and collective human behavior. Key
   components of the social-ecological system are often over-simplified or
   omitted. Generalized modeling is a dynamical systems approach that can
   overcome some of these challenges. It can rigorously analyze qualitative
   system dynamics such as regime shifts despite incomplete knowledge of
   the model's constituent processes. Here, we review generalized modeling
   and use a recent study on the Baltic Sea cod fishery's boom and collapse
   to demonstrate its application to modeling the dynamics of empirical
   social-ecological systems. These empirical applications demand new
   methods of analysis suited to larger, more complicated generalized
   models. Generalized modeling is a promising tool for rapidly developing
   mathematically rigorous, process-based understanding of a
   social-ecological system's dynamics despite limited knowledge of the
   system.
   Recommendations for Resource Managers Understanding empirical
   social-ecological dynamics requires integrating quantitative and
   qualitative data Generalized modeling can analyze qualitative dynamics,
   such as regime shifts, by integrating both qualitative and quantitative
   data Generalized modeling is well-suited to use in participatory or
   collaborative settings},

Title = {Capacity building for tourism development in a nested social-ecological
   system-A case study of the South Penghu Archipelago Marine National
   Park, Taiwan},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {123},
Pages = {66-73},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In subnational small-island settings with a relatively undisturbed
   natural environment and an out migration population, tourism development
   is often used as an alternative development strategy for economic and
   social regeneration. When such tourism development entails place-based
   management, such as in a marine protected area (MPA), tourism
   development can also be used as a strategy for alleviating the conflict
   between conservation and development as well as for increasing community
   participation. Local support and capacity building prior to tourism
   development are essential for involving local communities. Local
   communities are often complex and heterogeneous, and tourism development
   must be tailored to match their diverse needs. In this case study, three
   communities within the South Penghu Archipelago, where a marine national
   park and development of the tourism industry has been proposed, were
   investigated. This study assessed the perception of tourism development
   among community actors and the demands for capacity building to cope
   with future changes by conducting a social ecological system (SES)
   analysis wherein the South Penghu MPA was considered a nested SES
   composed of subsystems. The subsystems focused on in this study were
   fishermen and nonfishermen at the functional scale and individual
   communities at the spatial scale. The results showed that the
   perceptions on tourism development varied substantially among the
   community actors and the different sub-SESs because of their different
   experiences in social ecological interactions. Therefore, tourism
   development in a regional place-based management, such as in a MPA, must
   consider the various perceptions of such subsystems on tourism
   development. Rather than considering all local communities as a general
   unit, capacity building should be tailored to the needs of the community
   actors from the various sub-SESs. In addition, support from governmental
   agencies is essential for the success of community-based MPA policies.

Title = {The management of the blue whiting fishery as complex social-ecological
   system: The Galician case},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {36},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1301-1308},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In Europe, 88\% of fish stocks are being fished beyond Maximum
   Sustainable Yield and 30\% of stocks are outside of biological limits.
   The blue whiting fishery is also following a consistent trend of a
   declining, and the EU recently adopted a 93\% quota decrease for this
   species. Despite the abundant literature related to genetic aspects of
   population structure of aquatic resources, few studies have specifically
   addressed the link between fisheries management and population genetics.
   Given potential differences in the behavior of different subpopulations,
   population genetics has great relevance in the correct interpretation of
   the evolution of stocks. Ignoring the congruence of spatial scales
   between the population structure of fish species and management units
   can result in reduced productivity and local reduction of populations.
   This paper adopts the framework of resilience to explore the
   social-ecological feedbacks between unobserved genetic diversity and
   human dimension of the blue whiting fishery in Galician coastal
   communities due to the mismanagement of the fishery in the EU. The
   results presented here suggest that there is considerable evidence that
   the currently used management unit is inconsistent with the recent
   growth and genetic differences observed. The results also reveal that
   based on the evidence currently available and in accordance with the
   precautionary principle, the stocks of blue whiting in Northern and
   Southern ICES areas should be treated as separate in the Northeast
   Atlantic Ocean. The results obtained indicate that unobserved genetic
   diversity of the fishery can lead to an equivocal reduction of fishing
   quotas in the Southern area. Finally, the paper also shows that the
   total economic losses resulting from the 93\% quota decrease of the
   species, which includes effects on the rest of the Galician economy, is
   40,081,636 Euros per year. The next Common Fishery Policy Reform offers
   a great opportunity to reverse the current unsustainable path of the
   fishery and to accept humans as a component of this marine
   social-ecological system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Fortune of the Commons: Participatory Evaluation of Small-Scale
   Fisheries in the Brazilian Amazon},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {57},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1009-1023},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper applies a participatory approach in evaluating small-scale
   fisheries, focusing on the Arapaima gigas fishery in the Brazilian
   Amazon. The evaluation uses the social-ecological system (SES)
   framework, adopted to explain the conditions needed for sustainability
   and user cooperation in natural resources management, as a more suitable
   alternative to the `blueprint' or `panaceas' approaches, based only on
   property rights or governmental intervention. However, managers and
   users often do not have the necessary information compiled and available
   for a specific SES while some actions need to be taken immediately.
   Thus, consensus and negotiation among stakeholders about SES variables
   may be useful to evaluate system performance and indicate actions to
   promote sustainability. In the case study, using a consensus-building
   model, we found that arapaima SES leads to sustainability and is far
   from being a case of `tragedy of the commons.' More investments in
   suitable monitoring and enforcement for adaptive management are
   recommended. Adopting an SES framework based on stakeholders' prospects
   may be useful until complete interdisciplinary studies become available
   so as to seek of sustainability in the long term.},

Title = {The social-ecological system of the Kenai River Fishery (Alaska, USA)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {331},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {We present a collaboratively developed social-ecological model of the
   Kenai River Fishery. We developed the model through iterative interviews
   with stakeholders throughout the Kenai Peninsula using a novel
   participatory Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping process grounded in Ostrom's
   social-ecological systems framework. Individual social -ecological
   models, developed one-on-one with stakeholders, were combined into a
   single aggregated model representing the system's structure and
   function. We validated this aggregated model through subsequent
   in-terviews with stakeholders and focused literature reviews. The result
   is a model that can: 1) illustrate the breadth and interconnectedness of
   the Kenai River Fishery's social-ecological system; 2) be used to
   facilitate discussions around management of the fishery; and 3) be used
   to explore the components and interactions that move the system toward
   or away from sustainability. Using the model, we identify how the nature
   of salmon (migratory) and their habitat (large and unpredictable) leads
   to uncertainty about effective management strategies. This uncertainty,
   in addition to a large and diverse set of resource users, creates
   conflicting management goals that ultimately limit the governance system
   in making decisions that might increase the sustainability of the
   fishery.},

Title = {A probabilistic model that determines the social ecological system (SES)
   attributes that lead to successful discard management},
Journal = {REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {109-119},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The social ecological system (SES) framework is used to investigate the
   success of discard management, by gathering knowledge from worldwide
   examples of discard management applications. The literature search
   confirmed that most efforts aiming to reduce discards were implemented
   under top-down management schemes. For about half of the case studies
   where management tools were applied, a reduction of discards was
   achieved. To determine the attributes that influence the discard
   management success, a probabilistic classifier model (Naive Bayes
   Classifier) was used. This revealed that commonly used interventions to
   reduce discards can be ineffective unless advice is given in alternative
   forms that have societal acceptance. The role of social cohesion and
   stakeholder enforcement mechanisms is underlined and increases the odds
   of meeting successfully the recommendations for achieving sustainable
   fisheries. A successful combination of attributes that can lead to the
   minimization of discards requires robust social capital along with
   top-down measures. Overall, the classification algorithm proves the
   usefulness of the SES framework to describe the fishery response to
   managerial efforts that aim to reduce discarding. Establishment of links
   between fishing communities and scientists are the key for enhancing
   stakeholder engagement, increasing compliance and minimizing discards.},

   natural resources, and recruitment and retention of anglers},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {194},
Pages = {31-41},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Angler groups and water-body types interact to create a complex
   social-ecological system. Network analysis could inform detailed
   mechanistic models on, and provide managers better information about,
   basic patterns of fishing activity. Differences in behavior and
   reservoir selection among angler groups in a regional fishery, the Salt
   Valley fishery in southeastern Nebraska, USA, were assessed using a
   combination of cluster and network analyses. The four angler groups
   assessed ranged from less active, unskilled anglers (group One) to
   highly active, very skilled anglers (group Four). Reservoir use patterns
   and the resulting network communities of these four angler groups
   differed; the number of reservoir communities for these groups ranged
   from two to three and appeared to be driven by reservoir location (group
   One), reservoir size and its associated attributes (groups Two and
   Four), or an interaction between reservoir size and location (group
   Three). Network analysis is a useful tool to describe differences in
   participation among angler groups within a regional fishery, and
   provides new insights about possible recruitment of anglers. For
   example, group One anglers fished reservoirs closer to home and had a
   greater probability of dropping out if local reservoir access were
   restricted.},

Abstract = {Climate change will impact on ecological, social, and economic elements
   of fisheries; however, the three are seldom considered in an integrated
   fashion. We develop a fishery-level assessment of economic resilience to
   climate change for the Tasmanian rock lobster fishery, a linked
   social-ecological system. We outline the main climate change forcing
   influences that link climate change to the fishery via changes in
   lobster abundance, distribution, and phenology. Using a bottom-up
   approach, we identify twelve economic attributes strongly related to the
   fisheries' economic resilience to climate change. Resilience attributes
   are grouped according to the level of the economic domain (business,
   sectoral, and governance). Attributes are then evaluated to determine
   the overall economic resilience of the rock lobster fishery in the
   context of the specific nature of predicted climate change effects. We
   identify areas of low resilience in the economic sub-system for this
   fishery. Evaluating the economic resilience of regional fisheries using
   this integrated, interdisciplinary framework provides a practical,
   parsimonious, and conceptually sound basis for undertaking comprehensive
   and contextually tailored assessments of climate change impacts and
   economic vulnerability. The framework can be extended to include a
   broader range of climate change impacts and the social domain of the
   human sub-system.},

Abstract = {In February and March 2017, a coastal El Nino caused extraordinary heavy
   rains and a rise in water temperatures along the coast of northern Peru.
   In this work, we document the impacts of this phenomenon on the
   artisanal fisheries and the scallop aquaculture sector, both of which
   represent important socio-economic activities for the province of
   Sechura. Despite the perceived absence of effective disaster management
   and rehabilitation policies, resource users opted for a wide range of
   different adaptation strategies and are currently striving towards
   recovery. One year after the event, the artisanal fisheries fleet has
   returned to operating almost on a normal scale, while the aquaculture
   sector is still drastically impacted, with many people continuing to
   work in different economic sectors and even in other regions of the
   country. Recovery of the social-ecological system of Sechura likely
   depends on the occurrence of scallop seed and the financial capacity of
   small-scale producers to reinitiate scallop cultures. Long-term
   consequences of this coastal El Nino are yet to be studied, though the
   need to develop trans-local and trans-sectoral management strategies for
   coping with disturbance events of this scale is emphasized.},

Volume = {360},

Abstract = {Informing fishery management decisions using coupled socio-ecological
   systems (CSES) models requires model construction that captures the
   systems interactions with high precision. Ecological uncertainty in
   fishery models is easily reduced using existing scientific literature,
   but social drivers are often poorly defined or understood. The lack of
   knowledge about fishermen behavior results in inaccurate models of
   questionable utility for fishery managers. We designed and constructed a
   high fidelity agent based model (ABM) using the socio-ecological
   framework that reduces social system uncertainty by capturing complex
   behaviors using data-driven bounded rationality and feedback. The
   resulting generalized ABM of CSES dynamics was instantiated to Pacific
   salmon fisheries at Kenai river in Upper Cook Inlet, Alaska. The
   data-driven model construction fuses multiple data-sets for
   classification of social and ecological fishery regimes into stochastic
   distributions; the agent behaviors were generalized by evolving
   parametrized equations using data-driven machine learning; multiple
   non-trivial metrics on multiple scales verified model's accuracy and
   predictive capacity. The verified model of CSES dynamics at the Kenai
   river revealed recent instability in the dipnet fishery coupled
   dynamics, historic instability in the drift gillnet fishery coupled
   dynamics due to a compensatory and aggressive fishing strategy, and in
   the future the model will be used for scenario-based studies to
   understand the outcomes of alternative management strategies. (C) 2017

   formalization},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Frameworks play an important role in analyzing social-ecological systems
   (SESs) because they provide shared concepts and variables that enable
   comparison between and accumulation of knowledge across multiple cases.
   One prominent SES framework focusing on local resource use has been
   developed by Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues. This framework is an
   extensive multi-tier collection of concepts and variables that have
   demonstrated relevance for explaining outcomes in a large number of case
   studies in the context of fishery, water, and forestry common-pool
   resources. The further development of this framework has raised a number
   of issues related to the formal relationships between the large number
   of concepts and variables involved. In particular, issues related to
   criteria for ordering the concepts into tiers, adding new concepts,
   defining outcomes metrics, and representing dynamics in the framework
   have been identified. We address these issues by applying methods from
   research fields that study formal relationships between concepts such as
   domain-specific languages, knowledge representation, and software
   engineering. We find that SES frameworks could include the following
   seven formal components: variables, concepts, attribution relationships,
   subsumption relationships, process relationships, aggregation
   relationships, and evaluation metrics. Applying these components to the
   Ostrom framework and a case study of recreational fishery, we find that
   they provide clear criteria for structuring concepts into tiers,
   defining outcome metrics, and representing dynamics. The components
   identified are generic, and the insights gained from this exercise may
   also be beneficial for the development of other SES frameworks.},

   evolutionary dynamics},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {46-52},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The growing demand for ecological resources puts pressure on many
   ecosystems and, in extreme cases, threatens the long-term survival of
   the associated social-ecological system. The sustainable use of
   resources helps to avoid the collapse of the system, but requires the
   balancing of two conflicting aims: the preservation of resource
   productivity and the provision of satisfactory returns. Although humans
   can consider expected future pay-offs in decision-making, the inherent
   variability of ecological resources makes future returns uncertain and
   complicates the determination of sustainable harvest behaviours. We
   present here an adaptive model in which human harvest behaviour is
   linked to a renewable resource with a randomly fluctuating growth rate.
   In the model, users adjust their harvest behaviour following a trade-off
   between the potential current harvest and the discounted future
   productivity of the resource. Our analyses reveal that rising resource
   variability increases the discount factor required for a sustainable
   harvest and reduces long-term pay-offs. A high discount factor,
   indicating certain future returns, makes the user-resource system robust
   against resource fluctuations albeit at the cost of a lowered maximum
   total harvest. By considering the user-resource system as a single
   co-evolving entity, our approach allows for the determination of
   sustainable harvest strategies in randomly fluctuating environments. (C)

Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 14},
Abstract = {The framework proposed by Ostrom (2009) has become one of the most
   utilized tools to address the complexity of social-ecological systems.
   Most cases use this framework to analyze the systems from the
   perspective of a single resource unit. However, the livelihoods in
   several coastal communities are diverse, so that the users interact with
   multiple common-pool resources, which makes their analysis difficult. In
   this sense, it is important to identify the key elements of management
   to achieve the sustainable use of the resources. In this study, we were
   able to do this in a coastal community where commercial fishing,
   ecotourism, and recreational fishing coexist. The system of interest,
   located in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico, was subdivided by resource
   type using a multi-method approach to data collection including surveys,
   interviews, and records review. A conceptual map was developed that
   shows how the second-tier variables are integrated through the
   governance and actors with the biophysical system. The actors involved
   in lobster fishing achieved a more complex governance system, followed
   by the ecotourism and recreational fishing; the complexity of the
   governance was related with the equity level of the actors. The analysis
   revealed the research gaps to develop management strategies and improve
   the sustainability of the system.},

Abstract = {South Africa's small pelagics fishery is currently the largest in volume
   and second largest in value in the southern Benguela. It exploits
   short-lived, small pelagic fishes such as anchovy (for reduction into
   fish meal and oil) and sardine (for reduction as well as human
   consumption through canned products), and to a lesser extent redeye
   round herring and mesopelagics, largely for reduction. We explore the
   recent history (1940s to present) of the social-ecological system around
   this fishery. The natural subsystem, at the scales of the ocean
   environment and the ecosystem, is characterized by high interannual and
   documented decadal-scale variability. We characterize the human social
   subsystem at the scales of the fishing industry, legislation, and west
   coast fishing towns, and demonstrate interdependencies between the
   natural and social subsystems by following system-scale changes. The
   pelagic fishing industry has evolved to deal with variability through
   consolidation, diversification, and range expansion. Legislation has
   increasingly looked for conservation of the resource while ensuring
   economic viability of the industry, and hence factory-and vessel-related
   jobs. Fishing communities under apartheid stayed largely dependent on
   company-generated infrastructure, combining seasonal employment in the
   fishing factories with inshore fishing, targeting rock lobster and line
   fish. While the pelagic industry persisted and communities survived, the
   resource base for both offshore and inshore fisheries gradually eroded.
   The advent of democracy in the mid-1990s brought allocation of long-term
   fishing rights to individuals or companies under conditions of depleted
   inshore resources aggravated by a shift in the distribution of pelagic
   fish away from the west coast towards the Cape south coast in the second
   half of the 1990s. The resultant loss of employment and fishing rights
   in the inshore has generated community coping strategies that include
   poaching and challenges to the current Marine Living Resources Act,
   while the industry continues to expand by range and species, possibly
   further eroding the resource base. We argue that the situation in the
   pelagic social-ecological system is indicative of further loss of
   resilience to change. Coping with future long-term, system-scale change
   will necessitate careful long-term scenario planning among the various
   interest groups involved, joint research being one way to overcome the
   communications breakdown and initiate the joint planning process.},

   system (SES) perspective and its inclusion in fishery management policy},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {185},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {This study describes the progress of the use of the SES perspective
   and/or the consideration of users' participation in the scientific
   literature that study Mexican fisheries, and their inclusion in the
   fishery management policy. Since 2001, there have been 57 published
   investigations on 19 fisheries, mostly from the north Pacific (n = 39),
   focussed mainly on the governance of SES of benthic fisheries, and from
   the southern Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea (n = 14), where
   co-management and the spiny lobster fishery are the most studied. From
   21 fisheries having a fishery management plan (FMP), only seven have an
   international sustainability standard, while another seven fisheries
   having a sustainability standard have no FMP. In addition, only nine
   fisheries, with literature that addresses the SES perspective and/or
   considers the user's participation (out of a total of 19), have a FMP
   and only four of those fisheries have a sustainability standard. This
   reflects a mismatch between the interests of the academic, fishery, and
   government sectors. The SES perspective has been stable in the academic
   research since 2012, and has been implemented for some fisheries through
   participatory management processes of international fishery standards;
   however, this perspective needs to be fully included in Mexican fishery
   management instruments (e.g., FMPs) and its implementation could be a
   primary goal for Mexican fishery policy.},

Title = {Exploring social-ecological trade-offs in fisheries using a coupled food
   web and human behavior model},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Marine fisheries represent a social-ecological system driven by both
   complex ecological processes and human interactions. Ecosystem-based
   fisheries management requires an understanding of both the biological
   and social components, and management failure can occur when either are
   excluded. Despite the significance of both, most research has focused on
   characterizing biological uncertainty rather than on better
   understanding the impacts of human behavior because of the difficulty of
   incorporating human behavior into simulation models. In this study, we
   use the fisheries in Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island, USA) as a case
   study to demonstrate how coupled modeling can be used to represent
   interactions between the food web and fishers in a social-ecological
   system. Narragansett Bay holds both a commercial fishery for forage
   fish, i.e., Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) and a recreational
   fishery for their predators, i.e. striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and
   bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix). To explore trade-offs between these two
   fisheries, we created a food web model and then coupled it to a
   recreational fishers' behavior model, creating a dynamic
   social-ecological representation of the ecosystem. Fish biomass was
   projected until 2030 in both the stand-alone food web model and the
   coupled social-ecological model, with results highlighting how the
   incorporation of fisher behavior in modeling can lead to changes in the
   ecosystem. We examined how model outputs varied in response to three
   attributes: (1) the forage fish commercial harvest scenario, (2) the
   predatory (piscivorous) fish abundance-catch relationship in the
   recreational fishery, and (3) the rate at which recreational fishers
   become discouraged (termed ``satisfaction loss{''}). Higher commercial
   harvest of forage fish led to lower piscivorous fish biomass but had
   minimal effects on the number of piscivorous fish caught recreationally
   or recreational fisher satisfaction. Both the abundancecatch
   relationship and satisfaction loss rate had notable effects on the fish
   biomass, the number of fish caught recreationally, and recreational
   fisher satisfaction. Currently, the lack of spatial and
   location-specific fisher behavior data limits the predictive use of our
   model. However, our modeling framework shows that fisher behavior can be
   successfully incorporated into a coupled social-ecological model through
   the use of agent-based modeling, and our results highlight that its
   inclusion can influence ecosystem dynamics. Because fisher decision
   making and the ecosystem can influence one another, social responses to
   changing ecosystems should be explicitly integrated into ecosystem
   modeling to improve ecosystem-based fisheries management efforts.},

Title = {Mechanisms of resilience in common-pool resource management systems:: an
   agent-based model of water use in a river basin},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The concept of resilience is widely promoted as a promising notion to
   guide new approaches to ecosystem and resource management that try to
   enhance a system's capacity to cope with change. A variety of mechanisms
   of resilience specific for different systems have been proposed. In the
   context of resource management those include but are not limited to the
   diversity of response options and flexibility of the social system to
   adaptively respond to changes on an adequate scale. However,
   implementation of resilience-based management in specific real-world
   systems has often proven difficult because of a limited understanding of
   suitable interventions and their impact on the resilience of the coupled
   social-ecological system. We propose an agent-based modeling approach to
   explore system characteristics and mechanisms of resilience in a complex
   resource management system, based on a case study of water use in the
   Amudarya River, which is a semiarid river basin. Water resources in its
   delta are used to sustain irrigated agriculture as well as aquatic
   ecosystems that provide fish and other ecosystem services. The three
   subsystems of the social-ecological system, i.e., the social system, the
   irrigation system, and an aquatic ecosystem, are linked by resource
   flows and the allocation decision making of actors on different levels.
   Simulation experiments are carried out to compare the resilience of
   different institutional settings of water management to changes in the
   variability and uncertainty of water availability. The aim is to
   investigate the influence of ( 1) the organizational structure of water
   management, ( 2) information on water availability, and ( 3) the
   diversity of water uses on the resilience of the system to short and
   long-term water scarcity. In this paper, the model concept and first
   simulation results are presented. As a first illustration of the
   approach the performances of a centralized and a decentralized regime
   are compared under different scenarios of information on water
   availability. Under the given conditions of a regularly fluctuating
   inflow and compliance of agents with orders from a national authority,
   the centralized system performs better as long as irrigation is the only
   type of water use. Diversification of resource use, e. g., irrigation
   and fishing, increases the performance of the decentralized regime and
   the resilience of both. Systematic analysis of the performance of
   different system structures will help to identify properties and
   mechanisms of resilience. This understanding will be valuable for the
   identification, development, and evaluation of management interventions
   in specific river basins.},

Abstract = {Describing the ecological character of Chilika has enabled advances in
   the formal conceptualisations and definition adopted by the Ramsar
   Convention on Wetlands to be presented, in particular through the
   inclusion of ecosystem services and governance settings. The evolution
   of the concept of ecological character is described and related to the
   parallel concept of ensuring the wise use of wetlands. Framing the
   ecological character of Chilika as a social-ecological system allows for
   identification and prioritization of a number of wetland features from
   their ecological and social subsystems, as well as pathways for
   governance systems that can be guided by the needs of meeting the limits
   of acceptable change for these parameters. Uncertainty about the
   trajectory of changes in ecological character calls for continued
   efforts in knowledge building, experimental management design, bridging
   different knowledge systems, and ongoing monitoring and evaluation. The
   Chilika Development Authority can enable such by: (a) enhancing
   knowledge and understanding of critical ecosystem functions and their
   relationship with system dynamics (particularly species migration and
   exchange between riverine, lagoon and sea; sediment and nutrient
   dynamics; and factors influencing distribution of macrophytes); (b)
   feeding ecological knowledge into management decisions and actions (such
   as the regulation of interferences to migratory pathways or species
   habitats, regulation of tourism pressure on critical habitats); (c)
   supporting the development of multilevel governance systems, and
   polycentric institutional and organizational linkages (particularly
   linking the role of fisher cooperatives, tourism associations, village
   panchayats within the overarching governance regime); and, (d)
   developing capacity for dealing with perturbations and uncertainties,

Abstract = {Social capital is an important resource that can be mobilized for
   purposive action or competitive gain. The distribution of social capital
   in social-ecological systems can determine who is more productive at
   extracting ecological resources and who emerges as influential in
   guiding their management, thereby empowering some while disempowering
   others. Despite its importance, the factors that contribute to variation
   in social capital among individuals have not been widely studied. We
   adopt a network perspective to examine what determines social capital
   among individuals in social-ecological systems. We begin by identifying
   network measures of social capital relevant for individuals in this
   context, and review existing evidence concerning their determinants.
   Using a complete social network dataset from Hawaii's longline fishery,
   we employ social network analysis and other statistical methods to
   empirically estimate these measures and determine the extent to which
   individual stakeholder attributes explain variation within them. We find
   that ethnicity is the strongest predictor of social capital. Measures of
   human capital (i.e., education, experience), years living in the
   community, and information-sharing attitudes are also important.
   Surprisingly, we find that when controlling for other factors, industry
   leaders and formal fishery representatives are generally not well
   connected. Our results offer new quantitative insights on the
   relationship between stakeholder diversity, social networks, and social
   capital in a coupled social-ecological system, which can aid in
   identifying barriers and opportunities for action to overcome resource
   management problems. Our results also have implications for achieving
   resource governance that is not only ecologically and economically
   sustainable, but also equitable.},

Title = {A case study from the southern Cape linefishery 1: The difficulty of

Abstract = {Variability on multiple temporal and spatial scales exposes fishers and
   fishing communities to multiple stressors. The impact and interplay of
   these stressors need to be considered to improve our understanding of
   social-ecological linkages if sustainable livelihoods are to be
   promoted. To this end, participant-led research was conducted in the
   small-scale traditional commercial linefishery of the southern Cape
   (South Africa) between Witsand and Mossel Bay. Knowledge and perceptions
   regarding stressors responsible for changes in the social-ecological
   system, which ultimately affect the fishers' ability to fish
   successfully, were recorded using semi-formal interviews and focus
   groups with 50 participants. The results presented not only offer
   valuable insights into the day-to-day experiences of these fishers, but
   also expose knowledge gaps that exist in micro-scale interactions
   influencing the fishery system. An analysis of various stressors is
   presented, which includes the impacts of and responses to climate
   variability; challenges presented by fisheries policies and regulatory
   frameworks; social and economic considerations; inadequate
   infrastructure; and general political considerations. The development of
   a more comprehensive understanding of stressors that affect the
   social-ecological system at various scales provides valuable insights
   into a fishery system that is currently not well described, and provides
   the basis for analyses into vulnerability and resilience.
   Significance:
   Understanding the impact and interplay of stressors at multiple scales
   is important if sustainable livelihoods are to be promoted.
   This research provides insight into the day-to-day experiences of
   fishers whilst exposing knowledge gaps that exist at a micro-scale.},

Title = {Reimagining large-scale open-water fisheries governance through adaptive
   comanagement in hilsa shad sanctuaries},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Almost a half million fishers in Bangladesh are predominantly reliant on
   the hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) fishery in the Meghna River and
   estuarine ecosystem. This paper adopts a broadened concept of
   social-ecological traps to frame the complex dynamics that emerge from
   social and ecological interactions in this highly natural
   resource-dependent social-ecological system (SES). We analyze how
   endogenous self-reinforcing processes in the system and poor initial
   conditions, particularly debt and lack of livelihood options outside
   fisheries, keep fishing households in poverty. We identify a policy
   decision in favor of incentive-based fisheries management as a critical
   juncture that influenced a trajectory of recovery in hilsa shad stocks
   in this complex adaptive system. Normative assessment of stakeholder
   perceptions indicates that fishers perceive a nominal improvement in
   well-being as a result of this policy. Compensation in return for
   compliance with a seasonal fishing ban in sanctuary areas does not,
   however, disrupt trap dynamics perpetuating the cycle of poverty, social
   exclusion, and political disempowerment in which fishing households are
   entrenched. Poverty and lack of alternative livelihood opportunities
   remain significant reasons for noncompliance with the ban as long as
   fishers do not have any meaningful representation in resource management
   and decision making. A secured tenure system through adaptive
   comanagement involving fishers in monitoring and enforcement of
   compliance with fishing bans, supported by sustainable finance for
   livelihood improvements outside of natural resource exploitation and
   predicated on responsive and accountable institutions for and by people
   who depend on the fishery, can form the foundation for local stewardship
   in a unique demonstration of contemporary large-scale open-water
   fisheries governance in this complex SES.},

Title = {An integrated risk-based assessment of the North Sea to guide
   ecosystem-based management},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {654},
Pages = {694-704},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {This study provides an integrated perspective to ecosystem based
   management (EBM) by considering a diverse array of societal goals, i.e.
   sustainable food supply, clean energy and a healthy marine ecosystem,
   and a selection of management measures to achieve them. The primary aim
   of this exercise is to provide guidance for (more) integrated EBM in the
   North Sea based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of those
   management measures in contributing to the conservation of marine
   biodiversity. A secondary aim is to identify the requirements of the
   knowledge base to guide such future EBM initiatives.
   Starting from the societal goals we performed a scoping exercise to
   identify a ``focal social-ecological system{''} which is a subset of the
   full social-ecological system but considered adequate to guide EBM
   towards the achievement of those societal goals. A semi-quantitative
   risk assessment including all the relevant human activities, their
   pressures and the impacted ecosystem components was then applied to
   identify the main threats to the North Sea biodiversity and evaluate the
   effectiveness of the management measures to mitigate those threats.
   This exercise revealed the need for such risk-based approaches in
   providing a more integrated perspective but also the trade-off between
   being comprehensive but qualitative versus quantitative but limited in
   terms of the ``focal{''} part of the SES that can be covered. The
   findings in this paper provide direction to the (further) development of
   EBM and its knowledge base that should ultimately allow an integrated
   perspective while maintaining its capacity to deliver the accuracy and
   detail needed for decision-making. (C) 2018 Wageningen UR Instritute for

Title = {A diagnostic procedure for applying the social-ecological systems
   framework in diverse cases},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The framework for analyzing sustainability of social-ecological systems
   (SES) framework of Elinor Ostrom is a multitier collection of concepts
   and variables that have proven to be relevant for understanding outcomes
   in diverse SES. The first tier of this framework includes the concepts
   resource system (RS) and resource units (RU), which are then further
   characterized through lower tier variables such as clarity of system
   boundaries and mobility. The long-term goal of framework development is
   to derive conclusions about which combinations of variables explain
   outcomes across diverse types of SES. This will only be possible if the
   concepts and variables of the framework can be made operational
   unambiguously for the different types of SES, which, however, remains a
   challenge. Reasons for this are that case studies examine other types of
   RS than those for which the framework has been developed or consider RS
   for which different actors obtain different kinds of RU. We explore
   these difficulties and relate them to antecedent work on common-pool
   resources and public goods. We propose a diagnostic procedure which
   resolves some of these difficulties by establishing a sequence of
   questions that facilitate the step-wise and unambiguous application of
   the SES framework to a given case. The questions relate to the actors
   benefiting from the SES, the collective goods involved in the generation
   of those benefits, and the action situations in which the collective
   goods are provided and appropriated. We illustrate the diagnostic
   procedure for four case studies in the context of irrigated agriculture
   in New Mexico, common property meadows in the Swiss Alps, recreational
   fishery in Germany, and energy regions in Austria. We conclude that the
   current SES framework has limitations when applied to complex, multiuse
   SES, because it does not sufficiently capture the actor
   interdependencies introduced through RS and RU characteristics and
   dynamics.},

Abstract = {Lobster fishing is the main source of income for the people from the
   Juan Fernandez Archipelago (population ca. 770), located more than 700
   km off central Chile. An artisanal fishery has operated uninterruptedly
   for more than a century with few harvest controls (season, size, no
   egg-bearing females). Access to the resource has long been regulated by
   an informal but well structured traditional sea tenure system, which has
   effectively constrained the growth of fleet size. Nevertheless, and in
   spite of a lack of impending crises, assessments conducted over the last
   40 years have recurrently diagnosed that effort is well above the
   optimum level. On that basis, generic ``solutions{''} (quotas, marine
   protected areas, closures) have been prescribed with no attention to
   their possible impacts on the users and on traditional tenure
   arrangements. We discuss the merit of those diagnostics and
   prescriptions, and conclude that the disruption created by their
   eventual implementation would threaten the sustainability of the
   fishery. An analysis of the entire social-ecological system is needed
   before drastic solutions are prescribed. We investigate the factors that
   favor sustainability using Ostrom's framework for the analysis of
   social-ecological systems. Those factors have to do with the resource
   system (a productive stock with well defined boundaries and divisibility
   of fishing spots among users), governance (traditional tenure and simple
   operational rules), the users (few, strongly dependent on the resource,
   and sharing a detailed mental model of the resource system), and
   interactions (self-organization and partnerships). The resilience of the
   system was tested by the devastating tsunami that hit the islands in
   February 2010. This case study illustrates the need to attend to the
   interactions among resources, users and institutions in the search for
   effective solutions and to avoid disruptive management interventions.

Abstract = {Here, we synthesize conceptual frameworks, applied modeling approaches,
   and as case studies to highlight complex social-ecological system (SES)
   dynamics that inform environmental policy, conservation and management.
   Although a set of ``good practices{''} about what constitutes a good SES
   study are emerging, there is still a disconnection between generating
   SES scientific studies and providing decisionrelevant information to
   policy makers. Classical single variable/hypothesis studies rooted in
   one or two disciplines are still most common, leading to incremental
   growth in knowledge about the natural or social system, but rarely both.
   The recognition of human dimensions is a key aspect of successful
   planning and implementation in natural resource management,
   ecosystem-based management, fisheries management, and marine
   conservation. The lack of social data relating to human-nature
   interactions in this particular context is now seen as an omission,
   which can often erode the efficacy of any resource management or
   conservation action. There have been repeated calls for a
   transdisciplinary approach to complex SESs that incorporates resilience,
   complexity science characterized by intricate feedback interactions,
   emergent processes, non-linear dynamics and uncertainty. To achieve this
   vision, we need to embrace diverse research methodologies that
   incorporate ecology, sociology, anthropology, political science,
   economics and other disciplines that are anchored in empirical data. We
   conclude that to make SES research most useful in adding practical value
   to conservation planning, marine resource management planning processes
   and implementation, and the integration of resilience thinking into
   adaptation strategies, more research is needed on (1) understanding
   social-ecological landscapes and seascapes and patterns that would
   ensure planning process legitimacy, (2) costs of transformation
   (financial, social, environmental) to a stable resilient
   social-ecological system, (3) overcoming place-based data collection
   challenges as well as modeling challenges. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Participation of diverse actors and usage of traditional and local

   municipalities},

Abstract = {The participation of diverse actors and usage of traditional and local
   knowledge have been recognized as important for ecosystem management,
   including local biodiversity strategies and action plans (LBSAPs)
   implemented in municipalities. Assessing the effects and influences of
   the participation of diverse actors and usage of traditional and local
   knowledge requires analyses by a social-ecological system framework.
   This study aimed to clarify (1) how the participation of diverse actors
   and the recognition and usage of traditional knowledge that is passed
   down from generation to generation, and local knowledge that is unique
   to a local community were related to LBSAP actions and effects and (2)
   how various social and ecological factors were related with the
   participation of diverse actors and traditional and local knowledge. We
   conducted a questionnaire survey and obtained the data from 70
   municipalities that have formulated LBSAPs, in addition to other
   existing data from various sources. We then performed a multiple
   regression analysis using the full model including all explanatory
   variables. A positive relationship was observed between the variables
   for the participation of diverse actors and traditional and local
   knowledge and the variables for the information sharing, deliberation
   processes, the evaluative and investment activities of LBSAPs. For
   example, deliberation process of an LBSAP was thought to have provided
   an opportunity to recognize and learn local knowledge. Consciousness of
   local knowledge and usage of traditional knowledge in an LBSAP were then
   associated with awareness of change toward biodiversity among citizens.
   The participation of diverse actors and usage of traditional and local
   knowledge were influenced by several ecological and social factors such
   as natural and secondary forests, agricultural lands, population and
   influential people. These results suggest that participation of diverse
   actors and usage of traditional and local knowledge have a significant
   role in the formulation of LBSAPs and their outcomes.},

Title = {Unintended consequences of sustainable development initiatives: risks
   and opportunities in seagrass social-ecological systems},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Conserving biodiversity with a growing human population is a key
   sustainability challenge. Consequently, a vast number of development
   initiatives across the globe have been designed to combine social,
   economic, and environmental perspectives. For the most part, the
   development community is well acquainted with the negative experiences
   and unintended consequences that some projects have or may bring.
   However, in tropical coastal ecosystems, this aspect is not completely
   acknowledged, studied, or understood. Here, we use tropical seagrass
   meadows as a model social-ecological system to investigate how
   sustainable development initiatives result in unintended consequences
   with both positive and negative outcomes for environment and society. We
   analyze the initiatives and their effects in terms of a typology
   encompassing ???flow???, ???addition???, and ???deletion??? effects and
   investigate them across four types of sustainable development
   initiatives that occur within tropical coastal environments: (1)
   megafauna conservation, (2) alternative livelihood programs, (3)
   mosquito net malaria prophylaxis, and (4) marine protected areas. Using
   these four initiatives as examples, we show that sustainable development
   initiatives can produce unintended effects with major consequences.
   Further, we illustrate how not assessing such effects may ultimately
   undermine the initial goals of the sustainable development intervention.
   Our study suggests that acknowledging unintended effects and
   transitioning them so that they become sustainable is more effective
   than ignoring effects or viewing them as trade-offs. We strongly stress
   the need for an a priori process in which positive effects, negative
   effects, and potential uncertainties and surprises are considered when
   planning the development intervention, and we argue for greater
   social-ecological monitoring of initiatives. As such, this contribution
   links to contemporary approaches dealing with the sustainability of
   natural resources and social-ecological systems and bridges with the
   importance of development initiatives in the context of the United
   Nations Sustainable Development Goals.},

Title = {Trajectory of a coastal social-ecological system: analyzing co-evolution
   and regime shifts in the Thau lagoon (Mediterranean Sea, France),
   1970-2018},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {As coastal social-ecological systems (SES) are used for many different
   purposes and subject to different stressors, they are also among the
   most vulnerable and change the most rapidly. To achieve resilience,
   coastal areas require adaptive management based on integrated
   interdisciplinary approaches, requiring a deep understanding of SES
   dynamics, i.e. the ecological and social changes that comprise
   synchronicities and regime shifts. For the purpose of analyzing
   co-evolution and regime shifts, we propose an original and operational
   methodology combining (i) a chronosystemic timeline approach and (ii)
   time series analyses based on indicators from the
   ``Drivers-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses{''} framework (14 indicators
   including population growth, eutrophication status, ecosystem services,
   management actions and climate change indicators). The methodology was
   tested on a SES located on the French Mediterranean coast, the Thau
   lagoon, whose trajectory we studied over a 5-decade period (1970-2018).
   Our results show that the dynamics of co-evolution and regime shifts of
   the SES were driven by a succession of interactions between sanitary or
   ecological crises and management adaptations. During the study period,
   this typical Mediterranean coastal SES appears to have evolved towards
   the multiplication of uses, improvement of water quality and more
   integrative management. Our methodology also highlighted three
   contrasting periods characterized by stable emerging properties and
   identified several cause-and-effect relationships, which is rare in
   historical analyses of SES. These cause-and-effect relationships concern
   major sanitary and ecological crises that have led to a reorganization
   of governance mechanisms and to technical remediation actions. Our
   approach based on long-term trajectories will help identify the
   conditions required for increasing the resilience of coastal SES and the
   best management objectives to face new challenges related to global
   climate change.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {408},
Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {3-10},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {The literature on coral reefs and human resource use or fishing is
   reviewed less from the perspective of summarizing findings but more from
   the sociological perspective of what scientists chose to study, publish,
   and cite in journal articles. The motivation was to determine if coral
   reef science is generating information needed to solve the coral reef
   climate and fisheries crisis that has been publicized in many of the
   highest visibility and cited publications. The social-ecological system
   of coral reefs involves the environment, the ecosystem, human harvesting
   and social organization and the policies that arise from their
   interaction. Regardless of the focus and findings of any science
   investigation on this system, recommendations for management are
   limited, and include restrictions on space, time of use, effort, gear,
   species, size, and gender. Evaluating the scientific journal literature
   in the Scopus database on these restrictions indicates a disparity in
   focus for both publications and citations. The greatest number of
   scientists and citations are focused on spatial closures and fishing
   effort, effort seen as the problem and closures the solution. The other
   restrictions, that represent less extreme forms of management and have
   lower short-term social costs and trade offs, are not well studied and,
   when studied, investigated by either a small group of associated
   colleagues or transient one-publication investigators. When the values,
   selectivity, and incentives of scientists conflict with resource users
   desires for knowledge, incentives, and profits the resulting divide can
   weaken the social relevance and applicability of science and delay
   real-world problem solving. Societal engagement, acceptance,
   objectivity, and finding solutions are likely to increase if scientific
   effort is spread more evenly across this full spectrum of management
   restrictions and more components of the social-ecological system. (C)

   understand the emergent effects of changes in availability of razor
   clams and (2) explore how the tribal community might prepare for or
   adapt to these changes. Razor clams are a staple food and key source of
   income for the Quinault people because of their lasting abundance, low
   cost to harvest, and long season of availability relative to other
   natural resources. Lower income families experience disproportionate
   economic impacts during razor clam harvest closures, but less tangible
   social and cultural impacts are felt broadly throughout the community.
   Although razor clams have been, in general, available and safe for
   harvest in recent years, the Quinault people perceive many threats to
   the resource, including climate change, harmful algal blooms, pollution,
   and habitat loss. We used the perceived risks identified from the
   interview results, along with peer-reviewed scientific literature, to
   develop several ocean change scenarios. Using a stage-based population
   model of the Pacific razor clam, we explored the relative impacts of
   these scenarios on annual razor clam harvest over a 20-year period. The
   simulation of scenarios was developed into a user-friendly web-based
   application as a planning tool for the Quinault Indian Nation, to help
   them explore connections between ocean change and razor clam
   availability, and to support their efforts to plan for and adapt to the
   impacts of change.},

Title = {Integrated pond aquaculture and regional identity: ethnobiology of the
   golden humped tench of Poirino highlands, Northwest Italy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 11},
Abstract = {Background Social-ecological systems are based on particular species and
   on their direct and human-mediated interactions. The `golden humped
   tench' or tinca gobba dorata, a variety of tench-Tinca tinca (L.,
   1758)-traditionally bred in artificial ponds called peschiere in Poirino
   highlands, northwest Italy, is one of such species. The aim of the study
   is to investigate the traditional farming of the golden humped tench,
   the associated knowledge, practices, and gastronomy, and to discuss the
   changes that the tench, the ponds, and their role in the local
   social-ecological system are going through. Methods The data analyzed
   were collected in different locations of Poirino highlands during
   May-September 2021. Fieldwork included semi-structured interviews (n =
   23) with current and former tench farmers about the breeding and
   gastronomy of the tench and the management of the peschiere. The
   interviewees' selection occurred through an exponential
   non-discriminative snowball sampling, and interview transcripts were
   qualitatively analyzed through inductive thematic content analysis.
   Results The golden humped tench has been farmed for centuries in ponds
   used also to water livestock and to irrigate cultivated fields, and
   managed by every peasant household in the area. This integrated
   aquaculture system is underpinned by detailed knowledge on the peschiera
   ecosystem and on the tench life cycle and supports a gastronomic
   knowledge that is part of the local heritage. The ongoing process of
   gastronomic valorization of the tench is sustaining the role of the fish
   in locals' livelihoods and as a marker of regional identity, but it is
   also transforming tench farming, already threatened by livelihood
   change, pesticides, and invasive species, in controversial ways.
   Conclusions We argue that ponds and tenches are core elements of the
   local social-ecological system, defining the cultural landscape and
   engendering a form of regional identity around them. Studying integrated
   aquaculture systems and associated knowledge and practices is relevant
   to design sustainable systems of food production and to address
   possibilities of conservation of biodiversity and livelihoods in aquatic
   environments.},

Title = {Towards sustainable small-scale fisheries in China: A case study of
   Hainan},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {121},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {China is one of the most important marine fishery countries, yet little
   is known about its small-scale fisheries (SSFs). This paper uses Hainan
   Province of China as a case study to examine the present situation,
   predicaments, and future changes of the country's SSFs during a process
   of transition from extensive to green development. In doing so, we
   follow the social-ecological system (SES) framework to present Hainan's
   SSF-related settings, and study its resource systems, governance systems
   and actors through reviewing national and local policies, surveying and
   interviewing SSF stakeholders. Marine fisheries in Hainan is
   SSF-dominated, experienced dramatic increase in terms of yield and jobs
   since 1978, and became the main source of most fishermen's livelihood.
   Fish community structure and fishing targets have shifted from a mix of
   large-bodied demersals and pelagics to smaller-bodied pelagics with high
   growth rates and fecundity levels. This degradation puts stress on
   China's central and local governments to enhance the preservation of
   marine ecosystems. Effort controls failed to reduce fishing power due to
   subsidies, a series of measures were introduced in 2015 to correct these
   problems, including obligatory targets with accountability, subsidy
   reductions, buyback program, and further reductions of fishing vessels
   and allowable catch implemented in 2017. Hainan has explored different
   development directions for SSFs. First, providing policies and funds to
   reduce small fishing boats and construct larger vessels to support
   offshore and distant-water fisheries. Second, enhancing fishery value by
   integrating the development of fishery related primary, secondary, and
   tertiary industries. Third, developing existing SSFs in a sustainable
   manner through standardizing SSF vessel types, delineating operating
   areas, developing fishing port economy, and building beautiful fishing
   villages. These practices illustrate that China's centralized government
   can likely command transformational changes in ecological and
   socio-economic outcomes according to policy objectives. Also, a
   broadened perspective that considers the ecological, social, and
   economic dimensions of SSFs as whole is also crucial. Moreover, the
   integration of fishery policies with other related socioeconomic
   policies, and the interdepartmental cooperation is needed to achieve
   policy consistency across local governments.},

Title = {Coupled human and natural system dynamics as key to the sustainability
   of Lake Victoria's ecosystem services},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {East Africa's Lake Victoria provides resources and services to millions
   of people on the lake's shores and abroad. In particular, the lake's
   fisheries are an important source of protein, employment, and
   international economic connections for the whole region. Nonetheless,
   stock dynamics are poorly understood and currently unpredictable.
   Furthermore, fishery dynamics are intricately connected to other
   supporting services of the lake as well as to lakeshore societies and
   economies. Much research has been carried out piecemeal on different
   aspects of Lake Victoria's system; e.g., societies, biodiversity,
   fisheries, and eutrophication. However, to disentangle drivers and
   dynamics of change in this complex system, we need to put these pieces
   together and analyze the system as a whole. We did so by first building
   a qualitative model of the lake's social-ecological system. We then
   investigated the model system through a qualitative loop analysis, and
   finally examined effects of changes on the system state and structure.
   The model and its contextual analysis allowed us to investigate
   system-wide chain reactions resulting from disturbances. Importantly, we
   built a tool that can be used to analyze the cascading effects of
   management options and establish the requirements for their success. We
   found that high connectedness of the system at the exploitation level,
   through fisheries having multiple target stocks, can increase the
   stocks' vulnerability to exploitation but reduce society's vulnerability
   to variability in individual stocks. We describe how there are multiple
   pathways to any change in the system, which makes it difficult to
   identify the root cause of changes but also broadens the management
   toolkit. Also, we illustrate how nutrient enrichment is not a
   self-regulating process, and that explicit management is necessary to
   halt or reverse eutrophication. This model is simple and usable to
   assess system-wide effects of management policies, and can serve as a
   paving stone for future quantitative analyses of system dynamics at
   local scales.},

Abstract = {Marine reserves can create both benefits and costs to fishers. This
   article explores the perceptions of fishers in Kenya and Seychelles
   about displacement, spillover, and overall impacts of local marine
   reserves on their livelihoods. We test whether these perceptions are
   different among fishers from different geographic and socioeconomic
   conditions. Sixty-six percent of fishers had been displaced from marine
   reserves or coastal development and 90\% believed they had caught fishes
   that spilled over from marine reserves. Poorer fishers in Kenya were
   both displaced from, and also felt like they benefited from, marine
   reserves. This highlights how people's experiences with marine reserves,
   both positive and negative, are affected by a range of social
   considerations that may not be incorporated in typical evaluations of
   ecological and economic marine reserve success.},

Abstract = {We conducted a systematic review of the literature applying Elinor
   Ostrom's social-ecological systems framework (SESF), with a focus on
   studies using quantitative methodologies. We synthesized the
   step-by-step methodological decisions made across 51 studies into a
   methodological guide and decision tree for future applications of the
   framework. A synthesis of trends within each methodological step is
   provided in detail. Our descriptive summary is followed by a critical
   discussion of how this heterogeneity can lead to ambiguity in the
   interpretation of findings and hinder synthesis work. These critical
   reflections are supported by a survey of 22 scholars, each having been a
   co-author on at least one of the articles reviewed in this study, on the
   methodological challenges for applying the framework going forward.},

Title = {Institutional fit and the sustainability of social-ecological systems},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {34-40},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The literature on institutional fit is developing rapidly within the
   broader discourse on sustainability which has resulted in a diverse, but
   sometimes inconsistent program of research. Therefore we review the
   recent literature on the fit between institutions and social-ecological
   systems to identify three general types of fit: namely, ecological fit,
   social fit and social-ecological system fit. Each of these draws
   attention to different dimensions of social-ecological systems, with
   their own unique set of evaluative criteria. Although diversity is
   generally beneficial for the production of knowledge, it can also pose
   immense challenges as scholars and practitioners seek to build
   theoretically rigorous and practically useful knowledge concerning the
   sustainability of social-ecological systems. Therefore we present a
   typology which defines and summarizes the three major types of fit and
   can be used to organize and advance systematic theoretical and policy
   relevant inquiry.},

Title = {An integrated analysis of the marine social-ecological system of the
   Strait of Georgia, Canada, over the past four decades, and development
   of a regime shift index},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {115},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {14-27},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A Driver-Pressure-State-Impact conceptual model of the Strait of
   Georgia, Canada, was developed as a framework to characterise the low
   frequency temporal (regime-like) patterns of variability in this system
   since 1970, and to identify suitable indicators of these changes.
   Thirty-seven time series, including both bio-physical ({''}natural{''})
   and human variables, were assembled with sufficiently few missing years
   to permit multivariate statistical analyses. Principal component
   analyses identified regime-like shifts that correspond to those
   generally accepted for the NE Pacific (late 1970s; mid-1990s), plus an
   additional shift in the mid-1980s. Redundancy analyses identified
   significant relationships in which the natural and human explanatory
   driver/pressure variables accounted for 72\% of the variability of the
   state/impact response variables. Partitioning this variance among the
   natural and human drivers/pressures attributed 4\% to the natural
   drivers/pressures alone and 16\% to the human drivers/pressures alone,
   but 53\% to the interactions between natural and human drivers and
   pressures. Both sets of driver and pressure variables (natural and
   human) are therefore necessary to account for the patterns of
   variability of the state and impact variables in the Strait of Georgia.
   Redundancy analysis was also used to identify a reduced set of
   driver/pressure variables which accounted for a large proportion of the
   variability in the state and impact response variables: sea surface
   temperature, wind speed, the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation index, human
   population surrounding the Strait of Georgia, recreational fishing
   effort, and the number of hatchery releases of Chinook salmon
   (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) into the Strait. A structural change analysis
   was used to identify significant changes in these six explanatory
   variables, and to identify regime shift years (including their 95\%
   confidence intervals). A regime shift index for the Strait of Georgia
   was then constructed using a probabilistic causal network model. This
   model predicted the observed regime shift behaviour with a success rate
   of >70\%. These six explanatory variables are proposed as leading
   indicators for low frequency changes (regime shifts) in the Strait of
   Georgia marine social-ecological system for use within a broader
   monitoring program. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Assessment of Ostrom's social-ecological system framework for the
   comanagement of small-scale marine fisheries in Colombia: from local
   fishers' perspectives},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Fishery resource management under extractive production models in the
   Anthropocene has contributed to the collapse of fish stocks, threatening
   the food and livelihood security of many people, especially fishers.
   Common-pool resource theory has established the relevance of the design
   principles of Elinor Ostrom, which favor collective actions for the
   management of these resources. With the help of small-scale fishers, we
   assessed the state of Ostrom's principles in the study system to
   determine the conditions required to implement fishery comanagement in
   the future. The communities of Taganga (Caribbean coast) and Tumaco
   (Pacific coast), Colombia, served as case studies because of their known
   dependence on fishing and because both communities are currently facing
   a social-ecological crisis within their top-down administrative
   frameworks. We performed six hearings, three in each community in 2009,
   2012, and 2014, in which fishers brainstormed about the weaknesses that
   are closely related to Ostrom's social-ecological system framework.
   Additionally, 14 focus groups with 119 fishers (31 in Taganga in 2015;
   88 in Tumaco in 2017) were conducted, one for each major fishing method
   used in each community. The obtained results made it possible to
   establish a community vision on the condition of the principles in each
   community, and the principles were prioritized by the fishers do
   determine which ones need immediate attention. The inhabitants of both
   Taganga and Tumaco expressed the urgent need to establish clear
   biophysical limits among resource users, to gain the participation of
   all actors involved, and to build nested enterprises. In particular, the
   community of Tumaco considered monitoring resources and regulations,
   establishing graduated sanctions, and recognizing basic rights to be
   priorities. Furthermore, future opportunities and conflicts related to
   fishery comanagement implementation were evident in both communities.
   Therefore, our results indicate that Taganga and Tumaco are not yet
   ready to implement fishery comanagement. Nevertheless, they have the
   knowledge and motivation to overcome the obstacles that prevent them
   from moving forward with managing their fishery resources and to face
   the tragedy of the commons.},

Title = {Exploring Values and Beliefs in a Complex Coastal Social-Ecological
   System: A Case of Small-Scale Fishery and Dried Fish Production in Sagar
   Island, Indian Sundarbans},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC 21},
Abstract = {The survivability of the small-scale fishery and dried fish production
   in Indian Sundarbans, despite increasing threats posed by climate,
   environmental, economic, and policy drivers, suggests that they possess
   certain unique strengths and capabilities. One thread of these strengths
   is connected to the fact that Sundarbans' fishery system is strongly
   anchored in the values and beliefs of the local fishing communities.
   There is, however, limited empirical information available on the
   prevailing individual and collective attitudes, expectations,
   traditions, customs, and, above all, values and beliefs that strongly
   influence local fishing communities of Sundarbans. This manuscript aims
   to address this gap by drawing on qualitative data to (1) map the nature
   of values and beliefs associated with the Sundarbans' Sagar Island
   fishing communities who are engaged in small-scale fishery and dried
   fish production; and (2) highlight the contributions of values and
   beliefs to the small-scale fishery and dried fish production systems of
   Sagar Island. Our study reveals that historical factors such as the
   patriarchal and patrilineal system prevalent in the Indian Sundarbans as
   well as the current drivers, including environmental and social-economic
   changes, create inconsistent values and beliefs among male and female
   members of its society. Issues around values and beliefs are heavily
   influenced by social-ecological realities comprising material,
   relational and subjective dimensions. They can range from being strictly
   personal to largely community-oriented as they are shaped by realities
   of gender, class, power dynamics, and politics. Values and beliefs are
   fundamental to human perception and cognition but often get neglected in
   mainstream literature covering human dimensions of resource management.
   Our research adds weight to the theoretical and place-based
   understanding of the contributions of values and beliefs to the
   small-scale fishery and dried fish production systems. We learn from the
   case study that values and beliefs can act as mirrors, reflecting the
   current as well as future realities of small-scale fisheries and dried
   fish production systems and provide important directions for
   sustainability and viability of the entire social-ecological system that
   hosts this sector.},

   leisure, and aquatic transport agents and researchers) perception and
   classification of ecosystem services (ES) was assessed during 19
   collaborative sectoral workshops held with 178 participants from six
   coastal cities surrounding Babitonga Bay estuarine and coastal
   ecosystems (Santa Catarina state, South Brazil). Participants
   collectively enlisted the benefits, rights and resources (or services)
   they obtain from these ecosystems, rendering a total of 285 citations
   coded to conventional ES scientific typologies (127 ES grouped in 5
   types and 31 subtypes). We explore patterns in ES classificatory
   profiles, highlighting ecosystem user's salient identities and exploring
   how they shape political actions in relation to the implementation of an
   ecosystem based management regime. Food (provisioning service),
   tourism/leisure, employment, work and income (cultural services) as well
   as transportation (e.g. vessels, ports and navigation)
   (cultural/people's services) are perceived by all user groups, and hence
   consist the core set of perceived shared values amongst direct ecosystem
   users to inform future transformation narratives. Differences in
   perception of values amongst user groups combined with high levels of
   power asymmetry and fragmentation in decision-making, are steering the
   analyzed system toward an unsustainable pathway. The governance regime
   has been largely favoring subsets of services and unfair distribution of
   benefits, disregarding a more diverse array of real economic interests,
   and potential ecological knowledge contributions. Our integrative and
   deliberative ES valuation approach advances understanding of critical
   features of the scoping phase of ES assessment initiatives in coastal
   zones. We provide empirically grounded and theoretically informed
   suggestions for the promotion of local knowledge integration through
   combination of methods that supports transformational research agendas.
   This paper establishes new groundwork to fulfilling alternative visions
   for the regional social-ecological system transformation to a more
   socially and ecologically coherent and equitable development trajectory.},

Abstract = {We introduce six steps to define a ``Window of Tipping Point
   Analysis{''} which serves as a framework to increase the understanding
   of processes and tipping points in social-ecological systems. We apply
   the Window of Tipping Point Analysis to a mathematical model and two
   case studies (i.e., Baltic Sea and the Humboldt Current Upwelling
   system), focusing on three aspects. In ``to tip or be tipped{''} we look
   at agency in preventing (or driving) tipping. In ``to be tipped or not
   to be tipped{''} we discuss intertemporal developments and chosen time
   periods for delineating regime shifts. In ``to tip or not to tip{''} we
   discuss the desirability of states and their relation to the elements
   included. We argue that agency in tipping-point management, the
   occurrence of tipping points, and desirable states depend on the window
   chosen for the analysis.},

Volume = {52},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1314-1326},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Iceland's fisheries system is well-governed, data-rich, and has adapted
   to past ecological change. It thus provides an opportunity to identify
   social-ecological attributes of climate resilience and interactions
   among them. We elicited barriers and enabling conditions for adaptation
   in Iceland's fisheries from semi-structured expert interviews, using
   projections of fish habitat shifts by mid-century to guide discussion.
   Interviewees highlighted flexible management, highly connected
   institutions that facilitate learning, ample assets to expand adaptive
   options, and cultural comfort with change. However, examining how these
   attributes interact in reinforcing feedback loops revealed potential
   rigidity traps, where optimization for resilience to stock shifts may
   render the system more vulnerable to extreme environmental change and
   social backlash. This study articulates resilience attributes that
   Iceland and other fisheries systems might prioritize as the climate
   changes. It further explores circumstances in which these same
   attributes risk forming traps, and potential pathways to escape them.},

Abstract = {Management approaches that focus on social-ecological systems-systems
   comprised of ecosystems, landscapes, and humans-are needed to secure the
   sustainability of inland recreational fisheries without jeopardizing the
   integrity of the underlying social and ecological components. Resilience
   management can be useful because it focuses on providing recreational
   capacity for fishermen under a variety of conditions while assuring that
   the social-ecological system is not pushed to a critical threshold that
   would result in a new, undesired system regime. Resilience management is
   based on a system perspective that accounts for the possible regimes a
   system could manifest. It aims to enhance system properties that allow
   continued maintenance of the system in a desired regime in which
   multiple goods and services, including recreational capacity, are
   provided. In this forum paper, we provide an overview of the potential
   of a resilience approach to the management of recreational fisheries and
   highlight the scientific and administrative challenges to its successful
   implementation.

Abstract = {Inland fisheries are a vital component in the livelihoods and food
   security of people throughout the world, as well as contributing huge
   recreational and economic benefits. These valuable assets are
   jeopardized by lack of research-based understanding of the impacts of
   fisheries on inland ecosystems, and similarly the impact of human
   activities associated with inland waters on fisheries and aquatic
   biodiversity. To explore this topic, an international workshop was
   organized in order to examine strategies to incorporate fisheries into
   ecosystem approaches for management of inland waters. To achieve this
   goal, a new research agenda is needed that focuses on: quantifying the
   ecosystem services provided by fresh waters; quantifying the economic,
   social and nutritional benefits of inland fisheries; improving
   assessments designed to evaluate fisheries exploitation potential; and
   examining feedbacks between fisheries, ecosystem productivity and
   aquatic biodiversity. Accomplishing these objectives will require
   merging natural and social science approaches to address coupled
   social-ecological system dynamics.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY},

Volume = {93},

Pages = {541-549},
Abstract = {Limnology has greatly influenced the field of freshwater fisheries
   science, particularly fisheries biology. However, both fields became
   increasingly disconnected during the 20(th) century, when major research
   traditions within limnology became more tightly focused and humans, even
   fish, were externalized. A paradigm shift occurring within freshwater
   fisheries science today is redefining research questions and approaches
   and is further challenging the role of limnology within fisheries
   science. Modern fisheries science has become a multidisciplinary,
   interdisciplinary and sometimes transdisciplinary endeavour that melds
   the social with the natural sciences to understand fisheries as
   social-ecological systems. Limnology remains important to capture some
   of the dynamics inherent in social-ecological fisheries systems, but
   becomes one of the many necessary scientific disciplines of fisheries
   science, rather than the primary supporting science that it used to be.
   To improve scholarly communication between limnologists and freshwater
   fisheries scientists, major shifts in perspective are needed.},

Abstract = {This paper presents conclusions and recommendations that emerged from
   the 7th World Recreational Fishing Conference (WRFC) held in Campinas,
   Brazil in September 2014. Based on the recognition of the immense social
   and economic importance of recreational fisheries coupled with
   weaknesses in robust information about these fisheries in many areas of
   the world, particularly in many economies in transition, it is
   recommended to increase effort to build effective governance
   arrangements and improve monitoring and assessment frameworks in
   data-poor situations. Moreover, there is a need to increase
   interdisciplinary studies that will foster a systematic understanding of
   recreational fisheries as complex adaptive social-ecological systems. To
   promote sustainable recreational fisheries on a global scale, it is
   recommended the detailed suggestions for governance and management
   outlined in the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization
   Technical Guidelines for Responsible Fisheries: Recreational Fisheries
   are followed.},

Abstract = {Research on the interactions between human behaviour and ecological
   systems tends to focus on the direct effects of human activities on
   ecosystems, such as biodiversity loss. There is also increasing research
   effort directed towards ecosystem services. However, interventions to
   control people's use of the environment alter the incentives that
   natural resource users face, and therefore their decisions about
   resource use. The indirect effects of conservation interventions on
   biodiversity, modulated through human decision-making, are poorly
   studied but are likely to be significant and potentially
   counterintuitive. This is particularly so where people are dependent on
   multiple natural resources for their livelihoods, when both poverty and
   biodiversity loss are acute. An inter-disciplinary approach is required
   to quantify these interactions, with an understanding of human
   decision-making at its core; otherwise, predictions about the impacts of
   conservation policies may be highly misleading.},

Abstract = {It is widely recognized that stakeholder engagement processes produce
   advantages, but few studies acknowledge that they also can produce
   disadvantages. There is a global need to better assess stakeholder
   engagement processes by defining success and developing new methods to
   analyze stakeholder participation data. Our method of digitizing and
   coding stakeholder communications (1) produces a wide range of analyses,
   (2) tells the story of governance over time, (3) is comparable with
   other datasets, and (4) can be used wherever public documents exist. We
   demonstrate the utility of these integrated methods by examining
   statewide differences in public participation and success rates in
   Alaska's Board of Fisheries' (Board) proposal process. We determine that
   significantly different participation and success rates across the state
   indicate the existence of disadvantages and the need for further
   investigation into the equity, efficiency, and effectiveness of the
   Board process.},

Title = {Wild and Farmed Arctic Charr as a Tourism Product in an Era of Climate
   Change},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {The topic investigated is the social-ecological system of Arctic charr
   (Salvelinus alpinus) fishing and aquaculture as a tourism product in an
   era of climate change. Arctic charr is a resilient salmonid species that
   was traditionally an important part of the sustenance economy in Arctic
   and Subarctic communities as a source of fresh food throughout the year.
   Arctic charr populations have declined in recent years, in part due to
   climate change. These changes in the freshwater ecosystems in turn
   affect the cultural and economic traditions of freshwater fishing and
   consumption. This development has consequences for the tourism industry
   as hunting, fishing and consuming local and traditional food is
   important in branding tourism destinations. Fisheries are no longer the
   source of this important ingredient in the Nordic culinary tradition,
   instead aquaculture production supplies nearly all the Arctic charr
   consumed. In this paper, we pool the resources of an interdisciplinary
   team of scholars researching climate change, freshwater ecology,
   aquaculture and tourism. We integrate knowledge from these fields to
   discuss likely future scenarios for Arctic charr, their implications for
   transdisciplinary social ecosystem approaches to sustainable production,
   marketing and management, particularly how this relates to the growing
   industry of tourism in the Nordic Arctic and Subarctic region. We pose
   the questions whether Arctic Charr will be on the menu in 20 years and
   if so, where will it come from, and what consequences does that have for
   local food in tourism of the region? Our discussion starts with climate
   change and the question of how warm it is likely to get in the Nordic
   Arctic, particularly focusing on Iceland and Norway. To address the
   implications of the warming of lakes and rivers of the global north for
   Arctic charr we move on to a discussion of physiological and ecological
   factors that are important for the distribution of the species. We
   present the state of the art of Arctic charr aquaculture before
   articulating the importance of the species for marketing of local and
   regional food, particularly in the tourism market. Finally, we discuss
   the need for further elaboration of future scenarios for the interaction
   of the Arctic charr ecosystem and the economic trade in the species and
   draw conclusions about sustainable future development.},

Journal = {ESTUDIOS ATACAMENOS},
Year = {2020},
Number = {65},
Pages = {105-124},
Abstract = {Coastal artisanal fishing communities (small scale coves or
   ``caletas{''}) are complex socio-ecological systems that adapt to
   perturbations depending on their inherent complexity and properties. The
   ability to evaluate and monitor such adaptive response provides
   information on caletas sustainability, required for reliable territorial
   and strategic planning. Six caletas from different geographic locations
   in Chiloe Island, southern Chile, served as a model to identify
   territorial complexity. This article identified 4 criteria and 16
   sub-criteria (using Expert Choice software) as suitable descriptors of
   their complexity, and hierarchically ranked them according to importance
   (\%). All these variables were merged into a Territorial Complexity
   Index (ICT), a quali-quantitative estimator of caletas sustainability. A
   principal Component Analysis, including all sub-criteria, further
   characterized caletas complexity. This article showed that complexity
   needs an integrated analysis of the relevant variables to monitor
   evolutionary trajectories of caletas, and thus ICT is highlighted as a
   convenient quantitative tool for territorial and strategic planning.},

Title = {Recreational fisheries in inland waters},
Booktitle = {FRESHWATER FISHERIES ECOLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Pages = {449-465},
Abstract = {Recreational fisheries represent the dominant fisheries sector targeting
   wild freshwater fishes in all industrialized nations and are becoming
   increasingly popular in some emerging economies. The socio-economic
   benefits of recreational fisheries are numerous and substantial.
   Recreational fisheries through their practices (e.g. overharvest,
   habitat change, release mortality, stocking and dispersal of non-native
   fishes), however, have been implicated in negative effects on
   populations and ecosystems. In inland waters, fish populations also face
   a variety of threats that are external to the recreational fisheries
   sector such that recreational fisheries often operate on top of already
   imperilled resources. This chapter characterizes the scope and magnitude
   of inland recreational fisheries globally, explores recreational
   fisheries as a coupled social-ecological system, reviews management
   strategies, identifies the main issues faced by inland recreational
   fisheries and discusses the future of recreational fishing in inland
   waters with an emphasis on research and information needs to ensure
   their long-term sustainability.},

Abstract = {Studying social-ecological interactions systematically is difficult when
   dealing with case study data. The methodological flexibility inherent in
   case studies facilitates the discovery of complex relationships between
   social and ecological variables; however, it also poses problems for
   knowledge accumulation given the diverse ways that variables are
   measured, as well as the descriptive approaches to causal inference that
   are typically employed. This article builds on the Social-Ecological
   Systems Framework (SESF) to systematically compare interactions among
   variables across case studies. We adopt a `model-centered' meta-analysis
   of existing SESF case studies, in which the units of analysis are causal
   explanations including sets of variables and their effects on outcomes
   (i.e. `models'). Our analysis encompassed 30 studies and resulted in the
   formalization of 125 models. The analysis illustrates opportunities to
   assess interactions at different levels of detail . The paper concludes
   by proposing strategies to advance the study and reporting of
   interactions in case studies to foster a better understanding of
   dynamics and outcomes of environmental sustainability.},

Abstract = {The ability of resource-dependent communities to adapt to climate change
   depends in part on their perceptions and prioritization of specific
   climate-related threats. In the Maine lobster fishery, which is highly
   vulnerable to warming water associated with climate change, we found a
   strong majority (84\%) of fishers viewed warming water as a threat, but
   rank its impacts lower than other drivers of change (e.g., pollution).
   Two-thirds believed they will be personally affected by warming waters,
   but only half had plans to adapt. Those with adaptation plans
   demonstrated fundamentally different views of human agency in this
   system, observing greater anthropogenic threats, but also a greater
   ability to control the fishery through their own actions on the water
   and fisheries management processes. Lack of adaptation planning was
   linked to the view that warming waters result from natural cycles, and
   the expectation that technological advancements will help buffer the
   industry from warming waters.},

Title = {Assessing the sustainability and adaptive capacity of the gooseneck
   barnacle co-management system in Asturias, N. Spain},
Journal = {AMBIO},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {45},
Number = {2},
Pages = {230-240},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The gooseneck barnacle fishery in Asturias (N. Spain) has undergone
   three important changes: (1) the early implementation of a co-management
   system based on Territorial User Rights for Fishing, (2) a change in
   management measures (due to a decrease in landings), and (3) an economic
   crisis. This has allowed us to analyze the systems' sustainability in
   time through examining five critical variables: landings, effort, catch
   per unit effort (CPUE), mean market prices, and annual revenue.
   Additionally, we used focus groups and questionnaires to determine the
   response of the system to these three changes. Co-management has
   succeeded in maintaining or increasing CPUE throughout all management
   areas and produced stable mean market prices. This was achieved through
   flexible management policies and adaptive strategies adopted by the
   fishers, such as increased selectivity and diversification. The analysis
   of this fishery provides important lessons regarding the need to
   understand the evolutionary dynamics of co-management and the importance
   of embracing adaptive capacity.},

Abstract = {The impact of Hurricane Sandy on the Hudson-Raritan estuary (HRE)
   provided a valuable case study for exploring interactions between
   long-term environmental degradation, new climatic disturbance stressors,
   and human behavioral responses. We extend previous research on the
   ecological effects of major storms to compare water quality and
   biological parameters three years before and three years after Hurricane
   Sandy and consider how ecosystem shifts relate to anglers' perceptions.
   Results indicate that water clarity and nutrients returned to pre-storm
   conditions in about one year, while shifts in the biological community,
   including a significant increase in harmful algal species and declines
   in zooplankton and Atlantic menhaden, persisted for multiple years, and
   anglers continued to fish amidst ecosystem decline. Biotic recovery time
   in the HRE was longer than reports for other shallow estuaries
   frequently disturbed by hurricanes. Ecological and social responses
   suggest that the post-storm regime shifts and continued fishing pressure
   could further environmental degradation.},

Abstract = {Invertebrate gleaning is a small-scale fishery that commonly occurs in
   the intertidal zone across the tropical Indo-Pacific. In this study, we
   investigated and analyzed several components of this fishery on the
   island of Unguja, Zanzibar by employing the social-ecological systems
   framework from Ostrom 2009. In doing so, we conducted ecological
   surveys, catch assessments, interviews with gleaners, household surveys,
   focus group interviews and analyzed the governance structure. This
   social-ecological systems analysis showed that gleaning is important for
   food security, local culture and livelihood. Yet, the multiple
   approaches in our study revealed that the local intertidal zone is
   degrading and that the gleaned catch is changing. Local narratives
   indicate that economically important bivalves (Modiolus spp.) and
   gastropods (Strombus spp.) are in decline, which was paralleled with low
   abundances of both genera within the ecological survey of the intertidal
   and catch landing assessment. We recommend that invertebrate gleaning, a
   fishery mainly comprised of women should be included in fisheries
   management.},

Abstract = {The Cienaga Grande of Santa Marta is Colombia's largest coastal wetland

   evaluate the complex linkages existing among the social-ecological

   perceived by local stakeholders. The most critical anthropogenic impacts
   occurred during the last 50 years in the period following the
   construction of the Cienaga-Barranquilla highway. The changes to the
   social-ecological system have severely altered hydrological dynamics,
   reduced mangrove forest coverage and affected the composition of
   fisheries, with direct and indirect effects on the ecosystem services
   provision and on the well-being of the local people. Despite the
   ambitious restoration programmes put in practice during the last two
   decades, the social-ecological impacts of large infrastructure
   developments are visible today. The paper offers insights that can
   improve environmental decision making and promote adaptive governance in

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Local users may invest in managing common pool resources, thereby
   promoting social and ecological resilience. Institutional or economic
   limits on access are regarded as essential preconditions for
   incentivizing local investments, but we show that investment incentives
   can exist even under open access. We modeled a recreational harvest
   fishery in which local or centralized managers invest in fish stocking
   to maximize social welfare. Although classic open access dissipation of
   rents occurs at equilibrium, the sluggish response of fishing effort to
   changing conditions allows welfare to accrue in transition to
   equilibrium. This transient welfare creates persistent incentives to
   invest. Empirical observations showed that stocking by local collective
   action groups occurred at rates similar to model-predicted optima, while
   centralized stocking occurred at rates greater than predicted optima.
   Our results emphasize the potential benefits of local involvement in
   managing the commons, even under conditions that were previously thought
   to preclude effective collective action.},

Volume = {3},
Month = {NOV 8},
Abstract = {Populations in resource dependent economies gain well-being from the
   natural environment, in highly spatially and temporally variable
   patterns. To collect information on this, we designed and implemented a
   1586-household quantitative survey in the southwest coastal zone of
   Bangladesh. Data were collected on material, subjective and health
   dimensions of well-being in the context of natural resource use,
   particularly agriculture, aquaculture, mangroves and fisheries. The
   questionnaire included questions on factors that mediate poverty
   outcomes: mobility and remittances; loans and micro-credit;
   environmental perceptions; shocks; and women's empowerment. The data are
   stratified by social-ecological system to take into account spatial
   dynamics and the survey was repeated with the same respondents three
   times within a year to incorporate seasonal dynamics. The dataset
   includes blood pressure measurements and height and weight of men, women
   and children. In addition, the household listing includes basic data on
   livelihoods and income for approximately 10,000 households. The dataset
   facilitates interdisciplinary research on spatial and temporal dynamics
   of well-being in the context of natural resource dependence in low
   income countries.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {We report on outcomes and lessons learned from a 15-month initiative in
   Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake. Employing the appreciation-influence-control
   (AIC) model of participatory stakeholder engagement, the initiative
   built shared understanding of the sources of vulnerability in fisheries
   livelihoods and catalyzed collective action to support resilience in
   this valuable and productive social-ecological system. Outcomes include
   the transfer of a large, commercial fishing concession to community
   access, and resolution of a boundary dispute involving community fishery
   organizations in neighboring provinces. Motivated by these successes,
   the main national grassroots network representing fishing communities
   also modified its internal governance and strategy of engagement to
   emphasize constructive links with government and the formal NGO sector.
   The AIC approach, we argue, provides an effective route to enable
   collective action in ways that strengthen dialogue and collaboration
   across scales, fostering the conditions for local-level transformations
   that can contribute to improvement in governance. We conclude with a
   discussion of the broader implications for resilience practice.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the status and anthropogenic pressures on
   seagrass ecosystem. Urbanization and tourism in the coastal areas of
   Bintan, Indonesia were increasing in the recent years. They have become
   new pressures to intertidal ecosystem and habitats, particularly
   seagrass ecosystem. Seagrass meadows are the important ecosystem and
   habitats in Bintan region. They provide a wide range of ecosystem
   services, including for small-scale fisheries and have being Dugongs
   (Dugong dugon) habitats for food. Currently, the sea grass status is
   less healthy or damaged with 11 species. The anthropogenic disturbance
   processes have affected the spatial distribution, percent coverage,
   biodiversity, and community structure of sea grass. Moreover, several
   species are hard to find. Directly, sea grass meadows are impacted by
   introduced coastal development (i.e. settlement area, tourism
   accommodation, port, etc.), land-based pollution, reclamation, boating
   traffic, dredging activities and tourism activities. Sea grass
   conservation area and marine spatial planning based on the land-and
   seascape connectivity is important for conservation efforts and
   sustainable management of sea grass.},

Abstract = {The first relatively complete landscape-scale social-ecological system
   (SES) model of a recreational fishery was developed and ground-truthed
   with independent angling effort data. Based on the British Columbia
   multistock recreational fishery for rainbow trout (Oncorynchus mykiss),
   the model includes hundreds of individual lake fisheries, hundreds of
   thousands of anglers, originating from tens of communities, connected by
   complex road and trail networks, all distributed over a landscape of
   approximately half a million square kilometres. The approach is unique
   in that it incorporates realistic and empirically derived behavioural
   interactions within and among the three key components of the SES:
   angler communities, fish populations, and management policies. Current
   management policies were characterized and alternate policies assessed
   by simulation. We examined spatial patterns in ecological and social
   properties of the SES and used simulations to investigate the impacts of
   alternate management policies on these patterns. Simulation outcomes
   strongly depended on the spatial redistribution of anglers across the
   landscape, existing road networks, heterogeneity in angler behaviours,
   and the spatial pattern of fish population productivity.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic transformed social and economic systems globally,
   including fisheries systems. Decreases in seafood demand, supply chain
   disruptions, and public safety regulations required numerous adaptations
   to maintain the livelihoods and social resilience of fishing
   communities. Surveys, interviews, and focus groups were undertaken to
   assess impacts from and adaptive responses to the pandemic in commercial
   fisheries in five U.S. regions: the Northeast, California, Alaska, the
   U.S. Caribbean, and the Pacific Islands. Fishery adaptation strategies
   were categorized using the Resist-Accept-Direct (RAD) framework, a novel
   application to understand social transformation in a social-ecological
   system in response to a disturbance. A number of innovations emerged, or
   were facilitated, that could improve the fisheries' resilience to future
   disruptions. Fishers with diversified options and strategic flexibility
   generally fared better, i.e., had fewer disruptions to their
   livelihoods. Using the RAD framework to identify adaptation strategies
   from fishery system actors highlights opportunities for improving
   resilience of fisheries social-ecological systems to future stressors.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {JUL 12},
Abstract = {Understanding tipping point dynamics in harvested ecosystems is of
   crucial importance for sustainable resource management because ignoring
   their existence imperils social-ecological systems that depend on them.
   Fisheries collapses provide the best known examples for realizing
   tipping points with catastrophic ecological, economic and social
   consequences. However, present-day fisheries management systems still
   largely ignore the potential of their resources to exhibit such abrupt
   changes towards irreversible low productive states. Using a combination
   of statistical changepoint analysis and stochastic cusp modelling, here
   we show that Western Baltic cod is beyond such a tipping point caused by
   unsustainable exploitation levels that failed to account for changing
   environmental conditions. Furthermore, climate change stabilizes a novel
   and likely irreversible low productivity state of this fish stock that
   is not adapted to a fast warming environment. We hence argue that
   ignorance of non-linear resource dynamics has caused the demise of an
   economically and culturally important social-ecological system which
   calls for better adaptation of fisheries systems to climate change.},

Title = {Adaptation in a time of stress: A social-ecological perspective on
   changing fishing strategies in the Canadian snow crab fishery},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},

Volume = {60},

Abstract = {Recent scholarship has focused attention on the dynamics and management
   of marine social ecological systems and on the need for developing a
   deeper understanding of the fishing strategies of fish harvesters. This
   includes an understanding of how a broad range of factors influence the
   strategies of those at the `center' of marine social-ecological
   interactions. This paper reports on the findings of a survey of snow
   crab (Chionoecetes opilio) fishers in Southeastern Labrador conducted at
   a time (2005) of significant stress in the fishery. Results highlight
   that snow crab fishers are embedded in a social-ecological system and
   that shifts in fishing strategies in times of stress are a product of
   adapting to a dynamic, interactive set of factors that have social,
   economic, ecological and management aspects. Important differences
   between fleet sectors (larger and smaller vessels) as well as processes
   of learning are also described. The article concludes with a discussion
   of the implications for management and the utility of a holistic
   socialecological perspective. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Resource managers and policy makers have long recognized the importance
   of considering fisheries in the context of ecosystems; yet, movement
   towards widespread Ecosystem-based Fisheries Management (EBFM) has been
   slow. A conceptual reframing of fisheries management is occurring
   globally, which envisions fisheries as systems with interacting
   biophysical and human subsystems. This broader view, along with a
   process for decision making, can facilitate implementation of EBFM. A
   pathway to achieve these broadened objectives of EBFM in the United
   States is a Fishery Ecosystem Plan (FEP). The first generation of FEPs
   was conceived in the late 1990s as voluntary guidance documents that
   Regional Fishery Management Councils could adopt to develop and guide
   their ecosystem-based fisheries management decisions, but few of these
   FEPs took concrete steps to implement EBFM. Here, we emphasize the need
   for a new generation of FEPs that provide practical mechanisms for
   putting EBFM into practice in the United States. We argue that
   next-generation FEPs can balance environmental, economic, and social
   objectivesthe triple bottom lineto improve long-term planning for
   fishery systems.},

Abstract = {The ecosystem approach is a salient policy paradigm originating from a
   scientific understanding of the reality of complex ecosystem dynamics.
   In this article, we investigate how Swedish national marine policies and
   practice between 2002 and 2015 have changed towards an ecosystem
   approach. Government documents, the scientific literature, institutional
   changes, changes in legislation, pilot projects, and changes in science
   and public opinion were reviewed and combined with information from
   expert interviews. We found that changes in policy and practice have
   slowly stimulated the development of an ecosystem approach, but that
   limited political leadership, challenges of coordination, different
   agency cultures, and limited learning appears to be key barriers for
   further and more substantial change. We compare and contrast the Swedish
   national process of change with other documented experiences of
   implementing an ecosystem approach and find that several countries
   struggle with similar challenges. Substantial work still remains in
   Sweden and we provide suggestions for how to stimulate further and more
   substantial change at the national level.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the ecological-economic sustainability of coral
   reef socio-ecological systems under fishing and environmental pressures.
   To achieve this, a dynamic, spatially explicit, multi-species,
   multi-fleet fisheries model is developed. Stochastic environmental
   shocks are assumed to alter coral cover and consequently the entire
   coral reef social-ecological system. The model is calibrated using
   ecological, socio-economic and environmental data in French Polynesia.
   Four exploratory fishing strategies and a goal-seeking strategy entitled
   Stochastic Multi-Species Maximum Sustainable Yield (SMMSY) are compared
   in terms of ecological-economic outcomes and sustainability of the
   socio-ecological system. The SMMSY turns out to promote
   ecological-economic sustainability. It is characterised by a global
   increase in fishing effort pointing to the relative current
   under-exploitation of the fishery. SMMSY balances the trophic level of
   catches after natural shocks and sustains the fundamental herbivore
   grazing process. SMMSY strategies are also more diversified in terms of
   temporality, gears, spatial distribution of fishing and target species.},

Abstract = {Since the 1990s, the overexploitation of marine resources has led to the
   degradation of the fisheries' social-ecological systems (SES). In
   response to these collapses, scientific fishery studies have tried to
   develop multiple approaches to improve sustainability of the systems.
   The purpose of this study is to understand how the scientific literature
   conceives of the conceptual responses of the fisheries systems to
   social-ecological changes. Our research, based on a systematic
   literature review, builds a conceptual framework and highlights the
   level of importance scientific discourse which has conferred to the
   notions of uncertainty, resilience, adaptation, and governance in a
   context of changes in fisheries. The scientific discourse emphasizes
   relevant paradigms such as social and environmental justice associated
   with the distribution of resources, consideration of ecological
   knowledge, and the value associated with marine resources. Conversely,
   scientific discourse only marginally considers notions of equity, the
   ecosystem approach, and precaution. In addition to highlighting
   scientific paradigms framing fisheries systems in the face of
   social-ecological changes, this study discusses the influence of
   scientific knowledge-building mechanisms on scientific discourse.},

Abstract = {The concept of social-ecological knowledge diversity (SEKD) provides a
   novel way of examining coupled human-environment interactions-it
   acknowledges differences in knowledge, values, and beliefs of
   stakeholder groups within social-ecological systems (SES). Thus,
   understanding and measuring SEKD is an essential component of
   sustainable management with implications for conflict resolution,
   collective action and policymaking. However, methods to efficiently
   define and model knowledge diversity are still underdeveloped. Using a
   semiquantitative cognitive mapping approach, we collected and analyzed
   stakeholder-specific knowledge and perceptions of the Western Baltic cod
   fishery to model SEKD. Results demonstrate substantial variation in
   perceptions across different individuals and social groups. SEKD was
   evident in (a) distinctive meanings attached to social factors relative
   to ecological factors, (b) causal relationships underlying the
   understanding of SES dynamics, and (c) social impacts of ecological
   changes on ecosystems (and vice versa). By identifying and representing
   knowledge-specific disparities in SES frameworks, our model explicitly
   improves the understanding of human-environment interactions with
   implications that could help reduce conflicts and legitimize management
   plans.},

Abstract = {Quantitative models for marine ecosystem-based management are often
   constrained by availability of observations. Uncertainty about the
   underlying system structure can affect model estimates and conclusions
   about the consequences of management actions. Qualitative models can
   augment model development for decision-making and may provide an
   alternative to quantitative assessments. We apply qualitative loop
   analysis to assess the sensitivity of management outcomes to structural
   uncertainty within the Georges Bank social-ecological system. Loop
   analysis uses defined positive or negative relationships between system
   components to provide inference about cascading effects of pressures on
   components of management interest. We compare the sensitivity of
   outcomes from two management strategies in four model structures of the
   Georges Bank system that investigate trophic and socioeconomic model
   uncertainty. We summarize system responses to perturbation and compare
   these responses with a set of management objectives. Models with complex
   socioeconomic structure estimated positive outcomes more often but with
   less reliability than simpler models. Our analyses demonstrated
   trade-offs among habitat objectives for two management strategies, as
   well as uncertainty about the reliability of outcomes, contingent on
   model structure.},

Title = {Environmental change and resource access in aquatic food systems: a
   Photovoice case study of Cambodian fisheries},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Ecosystem services and the biodiversity that supports them directly
   provision food and livelihoods to millions around the world within
   environments increasingly facing multifaceted changes. Yet the
   perspectives of resource users on the value of those resources and the
   challenges they face amid social-ecological change are still too often
   poorly understood. In this study, we use Photovoice methodology and a
   social-ecological systems perspective to understand the value of access
   to fish resources and the impacts of changing access for small-scale
   fishing communities in Cambodia. Contrasting the perspectives of
   households in different ecological settings, including adjacent to the
   Tonle Sap Lake and within its floodplain, revealed stark differences in
   the experiences of regulation enforcement and fisheries management for
   communities that had viable alternatives to fishing compared to those
   without options beyond fishing. The study addresses the need to
   understand both the lived experiences of those on the frontlines of
   environmental changes, and to disentangle the heterogeneous experiences
   across and within communities to improve resource management and
   community support in complex, changing social-ecological systems.},

Volume = {61},

Abstract = {International interest in increasing marine protected area (MPA)
   coverage reflects broad recognition of the MPA as a key tool for marine
   ecosystems and fisheries management. Nevertheless, effective management
   remains a significant challenge. The present study contributes to
   enriching an understanding of best practices for MPA management through
   analysis of archived community survey data collected in the Philippines
   by the Learning Project (LP), a collaboration with United States Coral
   Triangle Initiative (USCTI), United States Agency for International
   Development (USAID), and partners. We evaluate stakeholder participation
   and social ecological interactions among resource users in MPA programs
   in the Palawan, Occidental Mindoro, and Batangas provinces in the
   Philippines. Analysis indicates that a complex suite of social
   ecological factors, including demographics, conservation beliefs, and
   scientifically correct knowledge influence participation, which in turn
   is related to perceived MPA performance. Findings indicate positive
   feedbacks within the system that have potential to strengthen
   perceptions of MPA success. The results of this evaluation provide
   empirical reinforcement to current inquiries concerning the role of
   participation in influencing MPA performance.},

Journal = {MARITIME STUDIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Worldwide there is an increasing realisation that there is an
   inextricable link between the natural and human systems, and there is a
   need to integrate these into the governance of small-scale fisheries.
   The critical importance of adopting such an approach is argued in this
   paper by exploring the challenge of resource over-exploitation in the
   abalone fishery in South Africa and the loco fishery in Chile, both of
   which faced unsuccessful fishery closures and the implementation of
   Territorial Use Rights in Fisheries (TURFs). By exploring similarities
   and differences in fisheries context and approaches, these case studies
   highlight that although management strategies have been progressive on
   paper, they are compromised, to different degrees, by a lack of
   understanding of the socio-economic and political factors that are
   influencing the fisheries system. We argue that unless a more integrated
   approach is adopted to understand the social-ecological system as a
   whole, few long-term benefits will be secured for both the resources and
   the livelihoods of fishers},

Abstract = {This interdisciplinary paper presents an empirical analysis of
   techno-institutional lock-in in a regional fishery, in the Logone
   floodplain in the Far North Region of Cameroon. In the Logone
   floodplain, one fishing technique is spreading exponentially even though
   it is changing the social, hydrological and ecological dynamics of the
   system in ways that are largely considered problematic by local
   communities. We use a complex systems framework to analyze large
   hydrological and socio-economic datasets. Results show how
   social-ecological feedbacks foster the spread of the technique and
   contribute to the process of lock-in. The lock-in leads to a resistance
   to change despite awareness of the technique's impact, a situation that
   may also be described as a social-ecological trap. We identify and
   explain four kinds of positive feedback loops relating to
   socio-economic, behavioral, demographic and hydrological processes,
   respectively. We also identify possible solutions that consider the
   complexity of the feedback loops across multiple dimensions of the
   floodplain system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In September 2015, the United Nations approved the 2030 Agenda for
   Sustainable Development that includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals
   (SDGs) and 169 SDG target. Recently, a line of research has emerged to
   study the importance of fisheries governance at various geographic
   levels for the social, economic and environmental development of the
   planet. This document studies what changes in fisheries are necessary to
   achieve the SDGs. For this, it is important to know how the images that
   stakeholders have about their governance. The images allow us to
   describe sustainability challenges, explain why governments take a
   certain decision, and learn about people's motivations to act in favour
   of sustainability. Using fishing in the Region of Murcia as a case
   study, this work analyses the images of various groups and their
   relationship to the SDGs. The results show a wide variety of images and
   thematic areas related with 84 SDG targets. Furthermore, the document
   analyses how the image management can facilitate the implement the SDGs
   in the fisheries and it offers three implications for improving its
   governance.},

Abstract = {While women globally make up nearly half of the fisheries workforce,
   their contribution to the sector has long been overlooked with
   implications for fisheries management. To assess women's participation
   in small-scale fisheries (SSF) management and related socio-cultural,
   environmental, and economic impacts, we conducted a systematic review of
   peer-reviewed literature (n = 124 case studies). Women had no or limited
   participation in more than 80\% of the examined case studies reporting
   their participation level in SSF management. Women's exclusion from SSF
   management resulted in negative outcomes, whereas their active
   participation was associated with various positive impacts at multiple
   scales. Most of the documented impacts were socio-cultural, suggesting a
   gap in documenting environmental impacts stemmed from women's
   participation in SSF management. Importantly, most impacts reported
   affected the social-ecological system scale, suggesting that gender
   inclusion may contribute to improving the management of SSF
   social-ecological systems. We conclude by highlighting the need to
   foster gender perspectives in data collection methods used in fisheries
   research, in SSF management, and in ecological research on SSF
   social-ecological systems.},

Abstract = {A common pattern of environmental crises is a vicious cycle between
   environmental degradation and socioeconomic disturbances. Here we show
   that while such feedbacks may give rise to critical transitions in
   social-ecological systems, at the same time they can offer novel
   opportunities for anticipating them. We model a community that has joint
   access to the harvest grounds of a resource that is prone to collapse.
   Individuals are tempted to overexploit the resource, while a cooperative
   harvesting norm spreads through the community via interpersonal
   relations. Both social and ecological collapses can be induced by
   environmental or socio-economic driving forces. Regardless of the type
   and cause of collapse we find that upcoming transitions may be detected
   using simple socio-economic response variables, such as individual
   profits. Our findings suggest that such alternative sources of
   information can be used to detect upcoming critical transitions in
   social-ecological systems. However, we also find that robust detection
   of critical transitions may be confounded by recovery attempts
   undertaken by resource users in the vicinity of an upcoming collapse,
   which may be falsely interpreted as a stabilization of the
   social-ecological system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   from South-Eastern Bangladesh},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {By employing empirical and secondary data (qualitative and
   quantitative), this study demonstrates how social equity (with its three
   dimensions) can meaningfully address the conservation of the coastal
   social-ecological system (SES), without losing diverse ecosystem
   services (ES) in south-east coastal Bangladesh. Based on this
   proposition, this study assesses the available ES and identifies the
   drivers responsible for ES changes, arguing for the application of
   social equity for resource conservation. The findings show that
   communities along Bangladesh's south-eastern coast use several ES for
   food, medicine, income, livelihoods, and cultural heritage. However,
   this valuable ecosystem is currently experiencing numerous threats and
   stressors of anthropogenic and natural origin. In particular,
   large-scale development activities, driven by the blue growth agenda,
   and neoliberalism policy, pose a risk to the local communities by
   degrading coastal ecosystem services. Escaping this situation for
   coastal natural resource-dependent communities in Bangladesh will
   require a transformation in the governance structure. Implementing the
   Small-Scale Fisheries (SSF) Guidelines that call for initiating policy
   change to deliver social justice to small-scale fisheries would help to
   address coastal ecosystem service conservation in Bangladesh.},

Abstract = {In this period of environmental change, understanding how resource users
   respond to such changes is critical for effective resource management
   and adaptation planning. Extensive work has focused on natural resource
   responses to environmental changes, but less has examined the response
   of resource users to such changes. We used an interdisciplinary approach
   to analyse changes in resource use among commercial trawl fishing
   communities in the northwest Atlantic, a region that has shown poleward
   shifts in harvested fish species. We found substantial community-level
   changes in fishing patterns since 1996: southern trawl fleets of larger
   vessels with low catch diversity fished up to 400 km further north,
   while trawl fleets of smaller vessels with low catch diversity shrank or
   disappeared from the data set over time. In contrast, trawl fleets (of
   both large and small vessels) with higher catch diversity neither
   changed fishing location dramatically or nor disappeared as often from
   the data set. This analysis suggests that catch diversity and high
   mobility may buffer fishing communities from effects of environmental
   change. Particularly in times of rapid and uncertain change,
   constructing diverse portfolios and allowing for fleet mobility may
   represent effective adaptation strategies.},

Title = {Challenges and opportunities for sustainable development and management
   of marine recreational and sport fisheries in the Western Indian Ocean},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {124},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region, information and data on marine
   recreational fisheries (MRF) is lacking, which undermines efforts
   towards their sustainable development. Our paper reviews the challenges
   and opportunities for sustainably developing marine recreational
   fisheries in the WIO. We identified several challenges that are
   discussed in two broad categories: (i) governance and (ii)
   socio-cultural and economic. We also show that addressing these
   challenges requires a holistic understanding of the socio-ecological
   complexities and the multi-scale nature of WIO MRF. Realizing the
   potential for sustainable development of this sector calls for the
   involvement of coastal communities in the sharing of benefits and
   decision-making. Further, coordinated efforts between the
   multi-government agencies and non-governmental organizations is critical
   for integrating recreational fisheries into local and national agendas.
   We conclude that the sustainable development of MRF in the WIO region is
   possible. Still, such growth will be dependent upon the sustained
   capacity building of coastal communities and indigenous fishers,
   collaboration from stakeholders, and the long-term sustainability of the
   resource.},

Abstract = {We assessed the relative contribution of a set of predictors on the
   short-term dynamics of the yellow clam intertidal fishery in Uruguay
   based on a community-based data collection program for five consecutive
   fishing seasons. Results of generalized linear mixed models showed that
   the occurrence of fishable days depends on the absence of red tide
   events and prevailing wind conditions, but also was related to the
   timing of each fishing event throughout the fishing season. Furthermore,
   higher fishing yields were coincident with the prevalence of northerly
   offshore winds. Catch per unit of effort levels of each fishing event
   were mostly related to interannual characteristics of each fishing
   season and, to a lesser extent, with fisher attributes (gender and age)
   and the timing of each fishing event. The adverse effect of red tides
   and unfavorable environmental conditions impose a high degree of
   uncertainty in this social-ecological system, leading to economic
   inefficiency. A key challenge for successful management of the yellow
   clam fishery and other similar small-scale fisheries relies in
   considering not only the resource and the governance subsystems, but
   also the dynamics of the resource users, together with relevant external
   drivers affecting them.},

Abstract = {Based on research conducted by myself and colleagues as part of the
   Southern Cape Interdisciplinary Fisheries Research Project, I present an
   overview of residents' perspectives on the Stilbaai Marine Protected
   Area, located on the Southern Cape coast of South Africa. Currently,
   South Africa's marine governance sector is often fraught with
   politicking, inefficiencies, and other effects that strain the
   social-ecological system. This research shows that despite some
   fragmentation of governance, there are opportunities, and a general
   willingness, to engage in activities that take care of the local
   environment on the behalf of residents, that serve to educate about
   ocean-positive behaviours and engage visitors more meaningfully on the
   benefits and value of the Stilbaai Marine Protected Area. Problems that
   residents perceive to be associated with the Marine Protected Area are
   noted, and suggestions are made to enhance a sense of caretaking, or
   sorgskap, within the community to fill the gaps of certain governance or
   regulation inadequacies. Indeed, I argue that in lieu of efficient
   formal governance structures and collaborations, it is the informal
   characteristic of caretaking activities by the community that renders
   these activities more sustainable, long term, and effective in building
   a ``culture{''} of caretaking.},

Title = {Distal impacts of aquarium trade: Exploring the emerging sandhopper
   (<i>Orchestoidea tuberculata</i>) artisanal shore gathering fishery in
   Chile},
Journal = {AMBIO},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {46},
Number = {6},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Artisanal fishery activities support the livelihoods of millions of
   people worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Within these
   fisheries, distal global drivers can promote switching between
   alternative target resources. These drivers can promote the rapid
   development of new, unregulated and previously unexploited fisheries
   that pose a threat to the sustainability of ecosystems. In this paper,
   we describe a new artisanal shore gathering activity that targets a
   previously unexploited resource: the sandhopper (Orchestoidea
   tuberculata). The activity is driven by aquarium trade demand for food.
   We used mixed methods to describe the activity, assessed basic
   socio-economic incentives, and estimated Catches per Unit Effort.
   Results show that the sandhopper plays an important role for the
   livelihoods of shore gatherers engaged in the activity. Gatherers have
   adapted and developed two main extraction methods with different degrees
   of investment and extraction rates. Furthermore, gatherers have
   developed local knowledge regarding the ecology and management of the
   resource. Results show that economic incentives can motivate a rapid
   expansion of this unregulated activity. Future research gaps and
   management options to address the development of this fishery are
   discussed in light of these findings.},

Title = {Struggling with social-ecological mismatches in marine management and
   conservation at Easter Island},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {92},
Pages = {21-29},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In Easter Island, most of fisheries regulations are top-down implemented
   by the central fisheries authority located 4000 km eastwards. This could
   generate problems in regulations compliance, given the cultural
   differences between the western worldview and Polynesian culture of
   Easter Island. A total of 18 issues that must be considered previously
   to an intervention in the island were identified. Four of them scored
   the highest difference between Rapanui and public services
   representatives. Among them, ``Integrating traditions and culture{''}
   had a little priority for the public services representatives, but was
   the most important for the Rapanui. According to the public services
   representatives in Easter Island and local fishermen, there is a little
   compliance with regulations related to fisheries and, due to cultural
   aspects, it is not possible to enforce regulations and apply sanctions.
   The low compliance with fisheries regulations is due to the lack of
   representativeness of regulations. Interventions in the island are based
   on western worldview that does not fit with social and ecological
   domains of social-ecological system. A flexible governance system, based
   on decision making at local level in line with local tradition is needed
   to navigate to a resource management and conservation in Easter Island.},

Title = {The Socioeconomic Impact of Coastal Environment Changes on Fishing
   Communities and Adaptation Strategies},
Journal = {FISHES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Oysters are one of the main aquatic products produced in Taiwan.
   However, because of the gradual changes in the environment of the
   Waisanding Sandbar, the oyster farming environment along the coast of
   Chiayi is shrinking, leading to greater operational risk and
   uncertainty. This study adopted a three-stage method to investigate the
   socioeconomic uncertainty that fishing communities face regarding
   environmental changes and to understand the environmental risk and
   fishery management awareness of different stakeholders as well as their
   views on adaptation strategies. In-depth interviews were used in the
   first stage. In Stage 2, two-round focus group interviews were conducted
   to organize views on the environment and climate, the oyster industry
   and management, and adaptation strategies. In the final stage, the AHP
   method was adopted to analyze the opinions of different stakeholders.
   The results showed factors affecting environmental change, oyster
   industry, and management among different stakeholders as well as the
   cognitive differences within the corresponding adaptation strategies.
   Therefore, socioeconomic and ecology complexities and uncertainties
   should be considered for enhancing social capital and promoting risk
   communication, more diverse social-ecological system data to assist
   fishery governance, and oyster industry development and adaptation
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Effective conservation of species requires an understanding of both the
   ecological characteristics of threats to the species in question, as
   well as the social and governance context of those threats. However,
   data on such characteristics and context are often lacking. This paper
   proposes the conservationscape framework as a guide for filling these
   data gaps, through interdisciplinary research that links species-focused
   conservation to a broader, human-inclusive understanding of threats and
   possible solutions. This framework, adapted from other social-ecological
   system frameworks, outlines (1) basic characteristics of species and the
   threats they face, (2) social factors (including economic and cultural
   factors) that influence human activities linked to these threats, and
   (3) governance context, or how human activities are managed (eg through
   regulations or institutions). The accidental capture, or bycatch, of
   marine mammals - specifically, Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella
   brevirostris) - by small-scale fisheries offers a practical example of
   how this framework can be used to develop a holistic understanding of
   conservation threats and possible solutions. For many conservation
   issues, this framework could help provide critical information,
   elucidate patterns and priorities through cross-site comparisons, and
   reduce the gap between research and effective conservation by informing
   solutions that integrate the human dimension.},

Title = {Can We Be Both Resilient and Well, and What Choices Do People Have?
   Incorporating Agency into the Resilience Debate from a Fisheries
   Perspective.},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {In the midst of a global fisheries crisis, there has been great interest
   in the fostering of adaptation and resilience in fisheries, as a means
   to reduce vulnerability and improve the capacity of fishing society to
   adapt to change. However, enhanced resilience does not automatically
   result in improved well-being of people, and adaptation strategies are
   riddled with difficult choices, or trade-offs, that people must
   negotiate. This paper uses the context of fisheries to explore some
   apparent tensions between adapting to change on the one hand, and the
   pursuit of well-being on the other, and illustrates that trade-offs can
   operate at different levels of scale. It argues that policies that seek
   to support fisheries resilience need to be built on a better
   understanding of the wide range of consequences that adaptation has on
   fisher well-being, the agency people exert in negotiating their
   adaptation strategies, and how this feeds back into the resilience of
   fisheries as a social-ecological system. The paper draws from theories
   on agency and adaptive preferences to illustrate how agency might be
   better incorporated into the resilience debate.},

Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {38},
Number = {6},
Pages = {634-653},
Abstract = {The land-sea interface is a complex social-ecological system
   characterized by natural ecological processes and human-induced changes.
   Holistic management of the shoreline is a critical element of an
   ecosystem-based approach to the land-sea interface in coastal zone
   management (CZM) programs. Anthropogenic alteration of shoreline
   environments has resulted in significant loss of sandy beach ecosystems
   and eroded the resilience of these systems to disturbance. We tested the
   efficacy of CZM programs in managing the land-sea interface under
   current and future challenges by comparing alternative approaches to
   shoreline management in two U. S. states (Hawai'i and North Carolina).
   Our results show that explicit prohibition of shoreline armoring has
   been more effective in conserving dynamic coastal environments and
   communities by passing the risk associated with coastal development from
   the public trust to private landowners. Over the long-term, robust
   anti-armoring legislation will de-incentivize risky coastal development
   projects while preserving coastal environments and the ecological
   services they provide to society. Policy prescriptions for effective
   shoreline management and increased coastal resilience under persistent
   coastal erosion and future sea-level rise are proposed.},

Abstract = {Oyster harvest has long been an important industry of the eastern coast
   of the United States. However, coastal development, overfishing and
   climate change are threatening this industry and way of life. This study
   examines the perspectives of oyster harvesters and merchants in
   Brunswick County, North Carolina, USA to explore their capacity to adapt
   to these changing conditions. Using in-person, semi-structured
   interviews researchers collected information from seventeen
   interviewees, generating qualitative data that were analyzed using
   MAXQDA software. From the data collected several themes emerged
   revealing mixed sentiments on the impacts of climate change but a
   widespread sense that development and regulations threaten livelihoods
   and cultural heritage. This social-ecological system (SES), created
   through centuries of regulation, is experiencing rapid population growth
   with concurrent coastal development; it also includes oyster industry
   workers who have limited voice in decision-making but are affected by
   the political ecology of the region. Deliberately including oyster
   harvesters and merchants when formulating and implementing policy can
   help to strengthen the adaptive capacity of this SES while sustaining
   Brunswick County's coastal heritage. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Climate change is increasingly impacting marine fisheries worldwide.
   Concurrently, scientific interest has grown to understand how these
   systems can cope and adapt, with research shifting from examining
   vulnerability to assessing risks to focusing on determining and
   operationalizing resilience. As fisheries-climate-resilience researchers
   and practitioners navigating a sea of frameworks, toolkits, strategies,
   policy goals, and management desires, we take stock to ask: what does
   resilience mean to us? Drawing on our experiences in the northeast
   United States, we discuss the challenges and ambiguity we encounter in
   concepts of social-ecological resilience and explore implications for
   research and implementation. We bring together perspectives to discuss
   various approaches to resilience, highlighting shared and unique
   challenges we face. We outline three key considerations as we move
   forward in resilience research and practice: (1) the need for greater
   transparency and reflexivity among researchers regarding how they frame
   and approach resilience; (2) the value of increasing coordination and
   communication among fisheries groups working on these topics; and (3)
   the use of co-developed and co-produced resilience research and
   strategies. We urge for greater centring of communities in these
   discussions and to explicitly consider how resilience interacts with
   equity outcomes.},

Title = {Managing ecosystems without prior knowledge: pathological outcomes of
   lake liming},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Management actions often need to be taken in the absence of ecological
   information to mitigate the impact of pressing environmental problems.
   Managers counteracted the detrimental effects of cultural acidification
   on aquatic ecosystems during the industrial era using liming to salvage
   biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, historical contingencies,
   i.e., whether lakes were naturally acidic or degraded because of
   acidification, were largely unknown and therefore not accounted for in
   management. It is uncertain whether liming outcomes had a potentially
   detrimental effect on naturally acidic lakes. Evidence from
   paleolimnological reconstructions allowed us to analyze community
   structure in limed acidified and naturally acidic lakes, and acidified
   and circumneutral references. We analyzed community structure of
   phytoplankton, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates (littoral, sublittoral,
   profundal), and fish between 2000 and 2004. Naturally acidic limed lakes
   formed communities that were not representative of the other lake types.
   The occurrence of fish species relevant for ecosystem service
   provisioning (fisheries potential) in naturally acidic limed lakes were
   confounded by biogeographical factors. In addition, sustained changes in
   water quality were conducive to harmful algal blooms. This highlights a
   pathological outcome of liming lakes when their naturally acidic
   conditions are not accounted for. Because liming is an important
   social-ecological system, sustained ecological change of lakes might
   incur undesired costs for societies in the long term.},

Abstract = {Regime shifts triggered by human activities and environmental changes
   have led to significant ecological and socioeconomic consequences in
   marine and terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. Ecological processes and
   feedbacks associated with regime shifts have received considerable
   attention, but human individual and collective behavior is rarely
   treated as an integrated component of such shifts. Here, we used
   generalized modeling to develop a coupled social-ecological model that
   integrated rich social and ecological data to investigate the role of
   social dynamics in the 1980s Baltic Sea cod boom and collapse. We showed
   that psychological, economic, and regulatory aspects of fisher decision
   making, in addition to ecological interactions, contributed both to the
   temporary persistence of the cod boom and to its subsequent collapse.
   These features of the social-ecological system also would have limited
   the effectiveness of stronger fishery regulations. Our results provide
   quantitative, empirical evidence that incorporating social dynamics into
   models of natural resources is critical for understanding how resources
   can be managed sustainably. We also show that generalized modeling,
   which is well-suited to collaborative model development and does not
   require detailed specification of causal relationships between system
   variables, can help tackle the complexities involved in creating and
   analyzing social-ecological models.},

   plans, there are still challenges to integrating social science into the
   decision-making process. There is a national and international
   understanding that if resource managers are to understand and develop
   strategies for coastal resilience, a holistic approach is needed that
   includes an understanding of the intersection between the dynamics of
   fisheries management and women's participation within fishing. The
   objective of this study was to collect oral history data related to past
   and current strategies for addressing fishing family and community
   resilience over time. Literature has documented ways in which limited
   access and catch share programs affect fishing community resilience and
   sustainability, but have few data that look at how these management
   systems may be affecting women's roles and participation within the
   industry. The results from this research adds to the literature on
   women's roles in the US and provide needed attention to their
   contribution to the wellbeing, resilience, and adaptive capacity of
   Oregon's evolving commercial fishing industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The concept of ecosystem goods and services and the approach of a linked
   social-ecological system were used to identify and describe the
   interactions between humans and seagrasses in a rural tropical economy
   in the East Coast of Zanzibar (Chwaka village). The main stakeholders in
   the population are fishermen and seaweed farmers. Through in-depth and
   semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, market data analysis and
   participant observation, we found a diversity of social-ecological links
   that are important for the welfare of the local population. Fishing
   grounds for finfish and invertebrates, substrate for seaweed cultivation
   and sites for bait collection were among the most important ecological
   support areas for fishermen and farmers. Seagrass-associated fisheries
   in the form of trap fisheries ({''}dema{''}) provided the highest daily
   average income per fisherman. Furthermore, seagrass-associated fish
   constituted the primary source of animal protein for the local people.
   Seagrasses were also used as traditional medicine and fertilizers. They
   provided a wide range of ecological services including aesthetical,
   instrumental, spiritual and religious. The amount of local ecological
   knowledge (LEK) among fishermen was substantial. No institution directly
   dealing with seagrasses in the area was identified. The use of a
   seascape management approach is recommended to improve and develop
   social-ecological resilience. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Privatization is, since Hardin, often promoted as a solution to many
   natural resource management challenges, particularly in common-pool
   resource systems. However, novel forms of privatization are being
   implemented in unexamined ways. In this article we explore how
   privatization affects natural resource management from the perspective
   of multi-dimensional social-ecological systems. We critique the notion
   that privatization is desirable due to its pure efficiency, and argue
   that efficiency must be relative to achieving other normative societal
   goals, in particular, sustainability. While sustainability outcomes
   often cannot be fully actualized, the processes through which
   privatization attempts to achieve them are more tangible criteria.
   First, we draw on (1) distributional and (2) procedural justice as
   normative societal goals to assess effectiveness of different forms of
   privatization. Second, we analyze the broader implications of
   privatization for social-ecological system functioning considering (3)
   path dependency and (4) spillover effects. We apply these four concepts
   to examine three different cases of privatization: eco-certification in
   fisheries, seed patents in agriculture and property rights in
   rangelands. We argue that the evaluative criteria for the success of
   privatization are often oversimplified, and highlight how privatization
   can influence social-ecological systems and the achievement of normative
   goals in largely unexamined ways.},

Abstract = {1. A key challenge facing ecologists and ecosystem managers is
   understanding what drives unexpected shifts in ecosystems and limits the
   effectiveness of human interventions. Research that integrates and
   analyses data from natural and social systems can provide important
   insight for unravelling the complexity of these dynamics. It is,
   therefore, a critical step towards the development of evidence-based,
   whole-system management approaches.
   2. To examine our ability to influence ecosystems that are behaving in
   unexpected ways, we explore three prominent cases of ``ecological
   surprise.{''} We captured the social-ecological systems (SES) using key
   variables and interactions from Ostrom's SES framework, which integrates
   broader ecosystem processes (e.g. climate, connectivity), management
   variables (e.g. quotas, restrictions, monitoring), resource use
   behaviours (e.g. harvesting) and the resource unit (e.g. trees, fish,
   clean water) being managed.
   3. Structural equation modelling revealed that management interventions
   often influenced resource use behaviours (e.g. rules and limits strongly
   affected harvest or pollution), but they did not have a significant
   effect on the abundance of the managed resource. Instead, most resource
   variability was related to ecological processes and feedbacks operating
   at broader spatial or temporal scales than management interventions,
   which locked the resource system into the degraded state.},

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic is a global shock that is significantly affecting
   coastal social-ecological systems (SES) in different parts of the world.
   Its widespread impacts have unravelled vulnerabilities in many aspects
   of society, including food systems. Our study investigated the impacts
   of a lockdown associated with the pandemic in the province of Bulacan,
   in the region of Central Luzon, Philippines, where aquaculture and
   capture fisheries are important and interconnected sectors. In
   particular, we focused on impacts related to production and market. We
   considered people's coping strategies and the factors that enabled such
   strategies. Our investigation adopted a case study approach and drew on
   qualitative data analysed through thematic analysis. The findings
   revealed differentiated mechanisms through which aquaculture and capture
   fisheries production were impacted. Both were strongly affected by
   market disruptions but through slightly different ways. In effect, the
   lockdown provided the impetus for the uptake and spreading of practices
   that were previously peripheral, particularly in relation to market
   exchanges. The study also identified a variety of coping strategies, as
   well as the importance of social support in the form of food aid,
   financial assistance, and institutional livelihood assistance. Finally,
   it discusses the importance of diversity in food sources, the role of
   local food systems, and governance implications for foregrounding
   social-ecological resilience in short-term response and long-term
   recovery.},

Abstract = {Sustainably managing fisheries for ecological and social objectives in
   the current era of rapid environmental change requires that managers,
   scientists, and fishery stakeholders work together to find solutions to
   complex problems. Recognizing that multiple forms of knowledge
   generation exist and focusing on the strengths of different
   ways-of-knowing can facilitate a more holistic understanding of these
   problems. Here, we illustrate the value in both natural and social
   science-generated information for informing our understanding of a
   rapidly changing social-ecological system. Using data collected through
   an in-person and online survey, we show that methods for quantifying
   user perceptions can facilitate the integration of social data with
   traditional scientific data collection efforts. Specifically, the
   synthesis of a Bayesian lifecycle model (Cunningham et al. 2018) for
   Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and quantified fisher
   perceptions suggests that natural science efforts and resource users
   largely agree on many of the factors that may be contributing to the
   observed declines in abundance of Chinook Salmon in Alaska. A
   qualitative assessment of the perceptions of resource users revealed
   benefits to incorporating stakeholders in science and management,
   including the ability to identify regional issues or trends potentially
   unrealized by natural science approaches. Our study highlights the
   synergistic value of multiple sources of ecological information for
   sustainably managing fishery systems.},

Abstract = {Marine social-ecological systems (SES) have been providing important
   cultural, social, and economic services for many centuries. They are,
   however, increasingly threatened by fast changing environmental,
   ecological, and socio-economic conditions. As historical marine research
   is increasingly developing into a multidisciplinary endeavour, it offers
   outstanding points of departure to analyse historic events and the
   response and adaptation of the respective SES. Such knowledge helps to
   inform today's fisheries management and promotes successful management
   of changing ecosystems. Here, we compile and analyse historical data
   (1890-1950) of the German Western Baltic Sea fishery SES. This period is
   characterised by a series of strong impacts due to political,
   technological, economic, and ecological changes, such as two world wars,
   a global economic crisis, and other economic or ecological disasters. In
   our opinion, potential negative effects of those events were in the past
   attenuated by the system's high capacity to adapt. However, most of the
   fishers ` historic options on how to respond and adapt have recently
   become no longer available. New threats (e.g. climate change) have
   emerged instead. We conclude that today's fisheries management needs to
   integrate options of adaptation by exhausting all present or future
   opportunities. Adaptive fisheries management should not only focus on
   environmental change but need to include socio-economic change as well.},

Abstract = {Community resilience, the capacity of a community to adapt to change in
   ways that result in positive impacts on its well-being, is increasingly
   used as a framework for understanding and enhancing the sustainability
   of forest-dependent communities as social ecological systems. However,
   studies linking community resilience to the implementation of forest
   management programs are limited. This study uses community resilience
   literature and analyzes data collected from interviews to study barriers
   of forest-dependent communities of collaborative forest management (CFM)
   in two forest-dependent communities in the Ashanti region of Ghana.
   Analysis revealed the barriers in community response to CFM programs in
   these two communities comprise institutional shortfalls in the design
   and implementation of the CFM program that have constrained the
   incentives, capacity and opportunities for communities to successfully
   adapt to the program. The paper offers recommendations on how the CFM
   program can contribute to building the resilience of communities in
   managing their forests. The first is to build institutional capacity of
   communities to play an active role in forest governance, and the second
   is the prioritization of well-being and livelihood enhancement as forest
   management goals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Mangal Play: A serious game to experience multi-stakeholder
   decision-making in complex mangrove social-ecological systems},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 24},
Abstract = {In order to achieve collaborative action in nature conservation and
   natural resources management, stakeholders have to understand and
   acknowledge other stakeholders' interests, values, world visions and
   objectives and they have to overcome the problem of irrational
   decision-making through innate opposition discourses. In this paper we
   developed the Mangal Play, an experiential learning method to have
   participants adopt the role of a particular stakeholder in an imaginary
   mangrove forest social-ecological system (SES). The Mangal Play is a
   serious game, more specifically a role-play, aimed at promoting oral
   dialogues between 20 stakeholders involved in governance, fisheries,
   aquaculture, agriculture, forestry, tourism, transport, conservation and
   communication sectors. By providing tools to lecturers and scientists to
   execute it in a public or classroom setting, the Mangal Play stimulates
   a decision-making process while accepting compromise and distinguishing
   bottom-line issues from negotiable positions, and instructs about the
   behaviour of complex real-world systems in a safe learning environment.
   We exemplify how social network analysis can serve to visualise the
   outcome and further develop the Mangal Play. In this way we hope to help
   stakeholders take into account diverse positions in a rational
   decision-making process.},

Title = {Sustained by Snakes? Seasonal Livelihood Strategies and Resource
   Conservation by Tonle Sap Fishers in Cambodia},

Year = {2008},
Volume = {36},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {This paper situates concerns for conservation of aquatic snakes and
   livelihood sustainability in Cambodia within a social-ecological systems
   context and thereby presents a challenge to conventional species-based
   conservation programmes. Fishing for low-value water snakes has become a
   widespread activity within the floating communities of Tonle Sap Lake in
   the last 20 years in response to new market opportunities, provided
   primarily by a crocodile farming industry. The scale and intensity of
   this new form of exploitation and reports of declines in catch per
   fisher have highlighted this activity as a conservation concern, yet its
   role within local livelihood strategies was previously unknown. We show
   that it is of increasing importance to the less well-off, and is linked
   to higher incomes within this group, where it potentially reduces their
   vulnerability to fluctuations and declines in fish catches. It is
   particularly important as a means to smooth seasonality of incomes in
   this flood pulse-driven social-ecological system. We argue that shifts
   between snake-hunting and fishing, as a market-driven adaptive
   livelihood strategy by the poor, may be more compatible with wider
   ecosystem conservation and development goals than alternatives such as
   increased fishing effort or converting floodplain habitats for seasonal
   agriculture.},

Title = {Poverty and the use of destructive fishing gear near east African marine
   protected areas},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {321-326},
Abstract = {Poverty may be an important influence on the exploitation of marine
   resources in tropical developing countries. A number of studies have
   hypothesized that destructive fishing gears, which can degrade habitat,
   capture high proportions of juvenile fish and ultimately lead to reduced
   yields, are primarily used by the poorer segments of society. However,
   few studies have empirically tested this relationship. This paper
   examines relationships between the use of destructive seine nets and
   thirteen socioeconomic conditions in communities adjacent to three
   peri-urban marine protected areas in east Africa. Fishers using
   destructive gears were younger, less likely to have capital invested in
   the fishery, had lower fortnightly expenditures and were poorer in two
   multivariate indices of material style of life. Based on the two
   multivariate material style of life indices, a binary logistic
   regression model classified whether fishers used destructive gears with
   almost 70\% accuracy. These findings are broadly consistent with the
   literature on poverty traps, which are situations in which the poor are
   unable to mobilize the resources required to overcome low-income
   situations and consequently engage in behaviour that may reinforce their
   own poverty. Managers aiming to reduce destructive gear use may need to
   partner with civil society and donors to help break poverty traps.},

   Context: An Ecosystem Service Assessment Approach in the German Baltic
   Sea},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Worldwide, fisheries have experienced change over time. An excess of
   exploitation for providing food has led to overfishing and the depletion
   of fish stocks. However, fishing communities are also part of the
   cultural heritage and contribute to the attractiveness of coastal areas
   to tourists. Our aim is to identify if ecosystem service assessments
   (ESA) can reflect the condition of fisheries and their economic and
   social aspects. We developed a tailored, expert-based ESA and applied it
   to two case studies in the eastern German Baltic Sea under different
   fishery management scenarios. The results show that reducing fishing
   pressure, actively restoring habitats, and improving their ecological
   status increase the provision of most ecosystem services. We discuss and
   conclude that ESAs allow for a holistic view on fisheries that goes
   beyond the economic importance of fisheries and shows both the
   interdependence between fisheries and healthy marine ecosystems, and
   their relevance for coastal communities. Such a holistic view is
   necessary for a sustainable approach to fisheries management. Our
   approach is easily transferable to other regions, and can be used to
   structure discussion on fisheries management scenarios, as well as to
   track and visualize societal changes.},

Abstract = {While international agreements and legislation call for incorporation of
   four pillars of sustainability, the social (including cultural),
   economic and institutional aspects (the `human dimension') have been
   relatively neglected to date. Three key impediments have been
   identified: a relative lack of explicit social, economic and
   institutional objectives; a general lack of process (frameworks,
   governance) for routine integration of all four pillars of
   sustainability; and a bias towards biological considerations. Practical
   integration requires a `systems' approach with explicit consideration of
   strategic and operational aspects of management; multidisciplinary or
   transdisciplinary evaluations; practical objectives for the four pillars
   of sustainability; appropriate participation; and a governance system
   that is able to integrate these diverse considerations in management. We
   challenge all involved in fisheries to immediately take five practical
   steps toward integrating ecological, economic, social and institutional
   aspects: (1) Adopt the perspective of the fishery as a `system' with
   interacting natural, human and management elements; (2) Be aware of both
   strategic and operational aspects of fisheries assessment and
   management; (3) Articulate overarching objectives that incorporate all
   four pillars of sustainability; (4) Encourage appropriate (and diverse)
   disciplinary participation in all aspects of research, evaluation and
   management; and (5) Encourage development of (or emulate) participatory
   governance.},

Abstract = {Millions of individuals worldwide rely on recreational fishing
   activities for leisure, food, and employment. Recreational fishing is
   the dominant freshwater fisheries sector in much of the highly developed
   world and plays a growing role in the marine realm, but in developing
   countries recreational fisheries occur within a different set of
   contextual conditions. Little is currently known about attributes of the
   recreational fishing sector in many developing countries. A survey of
   fisheries experts designed to identify knowledge gaps surrounding
   recreational fishery development was conducted to gather information on
   fishery attributes in developing countries. These surveys were
   supplemented with a review of relevant literature. Results show that
   recreational fishing is socially important and is expected to grow in
   most countries surveyed. Recreational fisheries were described as mainly
   consumption oriented in these regions. Most often, nonresident tourists
   used marine waters and resident recreational fishers used fresh waters.
   There was strong agreement among respondents on the need to address data
   deficiencies. The knowledge gaps and management needs identified can
   support international bodies and recreational fishing organizations
   (such as the regional fisheries bodies of the Food and Agricultural
   Organization of the United Nations, and local and international fishing
   associations) to support sustainable development and management of the
   global recreational fisheries sector.},

Abstract = {Efforts to confront the challenges of environmental change and
   uncertainty include attempts to adaptively manage social-ecological
   systems. However, critical questions remain about whether adaptive
   management can lead to sustainable outcomes for both ecosystems and
   society. Here, we make a contribution to these efforts by presenting a
   16-y analysis of ecological outcomes and perceived livelihood impacts
   from adaptive coral reef management in Papua New Guinea. The adaptive
   management system we studied was a customary rotational fisheries
   closure system (akin to fallow agriculture), which helped to increase
   the biomass of reef fish and make fish less wary (more catchable)
   relative to openly fished areas. However, over time the amount of fish
   in openly fished reefs slowly declined. We found that, overall, resource
   users tended to have positive perceptions about this system, but there
   were negative perceptions when fishing was being prohibited. We also
   highlight some of the key traits of this adaptive management system,
   including 1) strong social cohesion, whereby leaders played a critical
   role in knowledge exchange; 2) high levels of compliance, which was
   facilitated via a ``carrot-and-stick{''} approach that publicly rewarded
   good behavior and punished deviant behavior; and 3) high levels of
   participation by community actors.},

Journal = {AMBIO},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Understanding fisher beliefs and attitudes towards specific management
   strategies can help inform and improve fisheries management, and thus
   stock sustainability. Previous studies highlight a lack of fisher
   awareness regarding environmental issues influencing the systems they
   utilise and the negative impacts of specific strategies, such as stock
   enhancement. Our study used a two-phase approach to first elicit and
   then measure the strength of common fishers' beliefs and associated
   attitudes regarding stock enhancement. Specifically, this research
   focused on recreational fishers of an estuarine crab fishery (Portunus
   armatus) in south-western Australia. The results demonstrate that
   recreational fishers believe stock enhancement could have strong
   positive outcomes, but also recognise that this management strategy
   could lead to some negative outcomes, though the latter are perceived as
   less likely to happen. This contrasts with previous research on
   fisheries stocking and demonstrates the value of using the two-phase
   approach to clarify fishers' perceptions of particular management
   approaches. To reduce fisher dissatisfaction with management actions,
   careful communication on the benefits and costs of stock enhancement is
   recommended. Our study highlights the significance of integrating social
   sciences into fisheries research, and the need to better understand
   fishing community beliefs to ensure effective management of the fishery.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2017},

Abstract = {Adaptation of environmental policies to often unexpected crises is an
   important function of sustainable governance arrangements. However the
   relationship between environmental change and policy is complicated.
   Much research has focused on understanding institutional dynamics or the
   role of specific participants in the policy process. This paper draws
   attention to interest groups and the mechanism through which they
   influence policy change. Existing research offers conflicting evidence
   in regards to the different ways in which interest groups may affect
   change. This paper provides an in-depth study of the 2013 European Union
   Common Fisheries Policy reform a policy change characterized by active
   interest group participation. It traces the activity of interest group
   coalitions to understand how they achieved influence under a changing
   policy context. The study involves interviews with interest group
   representatives, policy experts and decision-makers, document analysis
   of interest group statements and EU legislative documents. Findings
   identify the important role of coalition building and informational
   lobbying for environmental interest group success in exploiting
   favorable sociopolitical conditions and influencing reform outcomes. An
   insight on interest group influence and its conditions contributes to
   our understanding of the complex dynamics of the environmental policy
   process as well as its implications for policy adaptation to
   environmental change.},

Abstract = {There is an urgent need for developing policy-relevant future scenarios
   of biodiversity and ecosystem services. This paper is a milestone toward
   this aim focusing on open ocean fisheries. We develop five contrasting
   Oceanic System Pathways (OSPs), based on the existing five archetypal
   worlds of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) developed for climate
   change research (e.g., Nakicenovic et al., 2014 and Riahi et al., 2016).
   First, we specify the boundaries of the oceanic social-ecological system
   under focus. Second, the two major driving forces of oceanic
   social-ecological systems are identified in each of three domains, viz.,
   economy, management and governance. For each OSP (OSP1 ``sustainability
   first{''}, OSP2 ``conventional trends{''}, OSP3 ``dislocation{''}, OSP4
   ``global elite and inequality{''}, OSP5 ``high tech and market{''}), a
   storyline is outlined describing the evolution of the driving forces
   with the corresponding SSP. Finally, we compare the different pathways
   of oceanic social-ecological systems by projecting them in the
   two-dimensional spaces defined by the driving forces, in each of the
   economy, management and governance domains. We expect that the OSPs will
   serve as a common basis for future model based scenario studies in the
   context of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the
   Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services
   (IPBES).},

Title = {Explaining institutional persistence, adaptation, and transformation in

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2013},

Abstract = {We investigated the capacity of a natural resource governance system to
   absorb a disturbance while maintaining its major structures and
   functions (defined as institutional resilience). Exemplified by East
   German recreational fisheries governance being disturbed by the German
   reunification, we studied why in five out of six East German states the
   former centralized governance system persisted while in one state a
   decentralized governance system was implemented. Based on resilience
   thinking and new institutional economics, three analytical steps were
   developed to assess: (1) the structure and function of the governance
   system, (2) the attributes of the disturbance and the reorganization
   process, and (3) human motivations. The centralized system persisted
   because leading managers wanted to preserve customary structures and
   functions, minimize transaction costs of change, and maintain powerful
   positions. This was possible because of their influential positions in
   the reorganization process. Our results suggest that in externally
   induced, fundamental, and rapid disturbances decision-makers tend to
   prevent transformations in their governance system. However, key
   managers in the sixth state faced the same disturbance but their lack of
   leadership and an emerging rivalry for fishing rights facilitated a
   transformation to decentralized governance. Thus, attributes of
   disturbances can be leveraged by actors' motivations in the
   reorganization process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Tracking changes in social-ecological systems along environmental
   disturbances with the ocean health index},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {841},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The well-being of coastal communities is intimately tied to a healthy
   ocean, but coastal social-ecological systems are among the most
   vulnerable to global change. Improving the resilience of coastal
   communities requires an understanding of how local social-ecological
   systems respond to shocks to better inform decision-making and adapt
   local management interventions. However, assessments of
   social-ecological changes throughout a disturbance regime are scarce at
   the local level, although critical for efficient natural resource
   management and sustainable use of ocean ecosystem services. Here, we
   apply the Ocean Health Index (OHI) to assess the status of the marine
   social-ecological system of a tropical island (Moorea, French
   Polynesia), and track changes of the system before, during and after a
   disturbance regime. Our results show that while there are signs of
   social-ecological recovery, coastal protection was most affected along
   the disturbance, and that there is room for improvement toward
   biodiversity conservation. In addition, our study highlights some
   context-specific challenges associated with local OHI assessments,
   particularly those driven by limited fisheries data and appropriate
   reference point selection for coastal protection. Our results
   demonstrate the value of localized, regular OHI assessments through time
   to track changes in marine social-ecological systems, while uncovering
   important data gaps, to inform management at appropriate scales for
   decision-making.},

Abstract = {Fisheries sustainability is recognized to have four pillars: ecological,
   economic, social (including cultural) and institutional (or governance).
   Although international agreements, and legislation in many
   jurisdictions, call for implementation of all four pillars of
   sustainability, the social, economic and institutional aspects (i.e.,
   the human dimensions) have not been comprehensively and collectively
   addressed to date. This study describes a framework for comprehensive
   fisheries evaluation developed by the Canadian Fisheries Research
   Network (CFRN) that articulates the full spectrum of ecological,
   economic, social and institutional objectives required under
   international agreements, together with candidate performance indicators
   for sustainable fisheries. The CFRN framework is aimed at practical
   fisheries evaluation and management and has a relatively balanced
   distribution of elements across the four pillars of sustainability
   relative to 10 alternative management decision support tools and
   indicator scorecards, which are heavily focused on ecological and
   economic aspects. The CFRN framework has five immediate uses: (a) It can
   serve as a logic frame for defining management objectives; (b) it can be
   used to define alternate management options to achieve given objectives;
   (c) it can serve as a tool for comparing management scenarios/options in
   decision support frameworks; (d) it can be employed to create a report
   card for comprehensive fisheries management evaluation; and (e) it is a
   tool for practical implementation of an integrated social-ecological
   system approach.},

Abstract = {Understanding how humans and other animals behave in response to changes
   in their environments is vital for predicting population dynamics and
   the trajectory of coupled social-ecological systems. Here, we present a
   novel framework for identifying emergent social behaviours in foragers
   (including humans engaged in fishing or hunting) in predator-prey
   contexts based on the exploration difficulty and exploitation potential
   of a renewable natural resource. A qualitative framework is introduced
   that predicts when foragers should behave territorially, search
   collectively, act independently or switch among these states. To
   validate it, we derived quantitative predictions from two models of
   different structure: a generic mathematical model, and a lattice-based
   evolutionary model emphasising exploitation and exclusion costs. These
   models independently identified that the exploration difficulty and
   exploitation potential of the natural resource controls the social
   behaviour of resource exploiters. Our theoretical predictions were
   finally compared to a diverse set of empirical cases focusing on
   fisheries and aquatic organisms across a range of taxa, substantiating
   the framework's predictions. Understanding social behaviour for given
   social-ecological characteristics has important implications,
   particularly for the design of governance structures and regulations to
   move exploited systems, such as fisheries, towards sustainability. Our
   framework provides concrete steps in this direction.},

Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},

Abstract = {This paper combines primary and secondary data to highlight the history
   of resource use and ongoing change in a coastal social-ecological system
   (SES) in Japan. We focus on Himeshima island, whose local community both
   depends on coastal ecosystem services and has developed over generations
   resource management practices informed by a rich body of traditional and
   local knowledge (TLK). By engaging with local resource users through
   focus group discussions (FGDs), household surveys and expert interviews
   we identify 14 ecosystem services that contribute manifold to the
   wellbeing of the local community. While provisioning services are key
   for the livelihoods of most community members, some of the cultural
   services related to the traditional food culture and food-sharing
   practices are a source of pride and cohesion for the local community.
   However, respondents indicated that several key provisioning and
   cultural ecosystem services have degraded over time through the combined
   effects of habitat change/loss and overexploitation. Underlying drivers
   include demographic, economic and technological change that has eroded
   TLK practices associated with fisheries management. New economic
   activities based on shrimp mariculture and tourism seek to revitalize
   Himeshima, but eventually create important ecosystem services trade-offs
   that could affect substantially the local community.},

Title = {Re-thinking Indonesian marine fisheries quota-based policy: A
   qualitative network of stakeholder perception at fisheries management
   area 718},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {243},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {As the largest archipelagic country, Indonesia has been unable to
   prioritize the ocean to improve its economy. Despite implementing
   various fisheries management approaches, Indonesia has consistently
   failed to establish the right policies. The Indonesian government's
   current breakthrough was to combine the ecosystem approach to fisheries
   management (EAFM) and quota-based fisheries management (QBFM). Policies
   that combine these two concepts are known as `perikanan terukur'
   (measurable fisheries). The observation views the perspective of local
   stakeholders on this measurable fisheries policy. Fisheries management
   area (FMA) 718 was conducted as research areas while designed as
   industrial fisheries and national fish supply areas. FMA 718 is also
   represented by Merauke Regency (South Papua) and Aru Islands Regency
   (Maluku). The perception of 67 key respondents was modeled using
   qualitative network modeling. The results showed at least 28 initial
   variables related to the response to QBFM. The developed model indicated
   that local stakeholders had rejected this policy. The implications that
   emerged to implement this policy were to ensure the distribution of
   authority between layers of government. The gap between local and
   commercial fishermen must be resolved immediately. There is a need for
   community involvement in policy, including efforts to develop policies
   based on data and factual conditions.},

Title = {Factors Influencing Small-Scale Fishers' Individual Perceived Wellbeing
   Satisfaction in Southern Benin},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In southern Benin, the rapid growth of demographics and the need for
   fishery products have forced public managers to adopt various management
   measures in the face of anti-ecological methods used by fishers;
   however, these strategies are often formulated independent from the
   context. These measures have not remained without consequence on the
   daily lives of fishers. This paper examines factors influencing fishers'
   individual perceived wellbeing satisfaction using the social-ecological
   system framework. Data on 205 small-scale fishers' demographic
   information, perception of job, and individual wellbeing satisfaction
   and governance subsystems were collected and analysed by the use of an
   ordered logistic regression. The results demonstrate that job
   satisfaction and ownership of water bodies (in contradiction to Ostrom's
   advocation for commons management) affected fishers' individual
   perceived wellbeing satisfaction. Fishers likely value ownerships,
   affecting their perceived wellbeing mainly in the South East. The
   prohibition of certain fishing gear decreases fishers' individual
   perceived wellbeing, indicating their attachment to these. Therefore,
   the question remains as to whether or not the scenarios of
   eco-sustainability of artisanal fisheries can be managed in the same
   manner as those related urban dwellers and the public sector. This is in
   particular reference to the line between urban land property rights,
   urban dwellers and the state, and property rights on water bodies,
   fishers, and the state.},

Title = {The adaptive cycles of woodlands, croplands, rangelands, and fisheries:
   developing a procedure to test the theory},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The theory of adaptive cycles, as developed almost 40 years ago by
   Holling (1986), has great potential as a tool to understand, anticipate,
   and alter the trajectories of change in natural resource systems.
   However, its incorporation in natural resource policy and management
   remains limited. A total of 112 studies are reviewed to assess how the
   theory of adaptive cycles has been applied to understand the behavior of
   natural resource systems (i.e., woodlands, croplands, rangelands, and
   fisheries) and how its application can be improved to enhance the
   potential of the theory to inform natural resource management. The
   review reveals that the theory has largely been applied in haphazard
   ways because there is no procedure in place to prevent the manipulation
   of empirical data to fit the path prescribed by the theory. The theory
   of adaptive cycles is primarily approached as a conceptual framework
   instead of as a set of testable and falsifiable hypotheses. Ill-fitting
   management recommendations can ensue when the theory is not tested,
   which demonstrates the pressing need for the development of a
   standardized procedure that future studies can follow. A 7-step
   procedure is developed to enhance the transparency and reliability of
   the application of the theory of adaptive cycles and to contribute to
   the realization of its potential to inform natural resource management.},

Title = {In the blind-spot of governance - Stakeholder perceptions on seagrasses
   to guide the management of an important ecosystem services provider},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {688},
Pages = {1081-1091},
Month = {OCT 20},
Abstract = {Seagrass ecosystems have been identified as important marine ecosystem
   service (ES) providers, they contribute to coastal protection, fisheries
   provision and mitigate climate change among others. Yet, they are
   declining globally at alarming rates. While the ecological dimensions of
   this social-ecological system have been well studied, its associated
   social aspects remain largely unexplored. Here, we show how the analysis
   of stakeholders' perceptions on seagrass ES, their drivers of change,
   links to wellbeing and governance structures can provide a path towards
   a more sustainable management. Stakeholders identified seagrass
   regulatory ES as crucial for the maintenance of social and economic
   wellbeing and the potential causes and consequences associated to
   seagrass dedine. Power imbalances, an over-compartmentalized legislation
   and a generalized lack of awareness were highlighted as key aspects to
   redress in order to achieve a more just governance system. Stakeholders'
   empirical evidence on the importance of particular ES and on negative
   drivers of change can also provide an understanding of areas where
   financial investment would gather wider public support and therefore be
   more successfully implemented. We showed how the different dimensions
   highlighted through stakeholders' perspectives can contribute to the
   consecution of a more inclusive sustainable management, a crucial aspect
   in the maintenance of seagrass ecosystems. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {New methods have emerged for testing common-pool resource theory in
   large-scale environmental governance contexts. We aim to contribute to
   that scholarship by assessing the relevance of Elinor Ostrom's design
   principles in the lower Mekong basin (LMB). The recent dam-building
   trend in the LMB has revealed a trade-off between hydropower development
   and the conservation of migratory fish species. The need to internalize
   or avoid the negative externalities of hydropower dam construction poses
   a new challenge to the LMB governance system and its main management
   body, the Mekong River Commission. Our objective was to explain the
   emergence of the trade-off and the capacity of the governance system to
   address it. Elinor Ostrom's design principles and other variables
   provided by the Socio-ecological Systems Meta-analysis Database were
   first coded with regard to secondary data and then tested against the
   capacity for cooperation of the LMB governance system. The lack of
   sanctioning despite a strong monitoring system, and the existence of
   fuzzy governance boundaries in the context of a powerful outsider like
   China, were particularly relevant to understanding the current
   cooperation stalemate in the basin. Other variables such as scientific
   knowledge, triggering events, markets, resource spatial heterogeneity,
   and heterogeneity of interests were also relevant.},

Journal = {ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {74},
Number = {1},
Pages = {379-381},
Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {There is now a large literature on ecosystem-based management (EBM; also
   known as the ecosystem approach). Our sense is that EBM is moving -
   albeit slowly - from the ``what's, why's and when's{''} to the
   ``how's{''} of operationalization and implementation; as such it seemed
   timely to develop this article theme set (TS). Our objectives were to
   ascertain the state of the discipline and to advance EBM by offering
   practical examples of its implementation -or attempts at such -in a
   variety of incarnations and at various scales, including what has or has
   not worked, suggestions for best practice, and lessons learned. As
   exemplified by the articles in this TS, key lessons learned include the
   need for: constant and clear communication with all parties involved;
   clear objectives and governance; the distillation of complex ecosystem
   information into digestible indicators; the establishment of reference
   levels on which management decisions can be made; and clear protocols to
   evaluate tradeoffs. Instances of truly multisectoral EBM remain rare,
   with EBM having advanced farthest within specific ocean-use sectors.
   Although progress towards implementing operational EBM has been somewhat
   limited, and although EBM is by its very nature complex and difficult to
   operationalize, there has been progress nonetheless. We hope that this
   TS will encourage even further operationalization of EBM.},

Title = {Who's who in the Kenai River Fishery SES: A streamlined method for
   stakeholder identification and investment analysis},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {71},
Pages = {194-200},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Kenai River Fishery is a unique social-ecological system (SES) with
   nearly 50 federal, state, local, and nonprofit groups influencing its
   political, ecological, and social structure. While ecological data
   exists for this fishery, the complexity of its stakeholder relationships
   has not been investigated. Stakeholder interactions can directly
   influence how science is integrated into management decisions and
   therefore affect the adaptive capacity of SES, such as the Kenai River
   Fishery. Drawing from the existing stakeholder literature, this methods
   identifies and ranks the key SES stakeholders and describes their roles.
   This study approached the question of which stakeholders should be
   included in a future SES adaptive capacity study by (1) identifying the
   key stakeholders within the Kenai River Fishery, (2) ranking each
   stakeholder's investment within the fishery using eleven categories of
   interaction, and (3) using these eleven categories to characterize each
   stakeholder's role within the SES. The largest number of stakeholders
   fall into the secondary investment category, showing that a relatively
   small number of resource managers are interacting with a large number of
   diverse nonprofit organizations. The top ranking stakeholders in this
   study will be invited to attend participatory scenarios workshops that
   will build the foundation for a deeper scenarios-based analysis of SES
   adaptive capacity. (C) 2016 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Developing a Social, Cultural and Economic Report Card for a Regional
   Industrial Harbour},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 3},
Abstract = {Report cards are increasingly used to provide ongoing snap-shots of
   progress towards specific ecosystem health goals, particularly in
   coastal regions where planners need to balance competing demands for
   coastal resources from a range of industries. While most previous report
   cards focus on the biophysical components of the system, there is a
   growing interest in including the social and economic implications of
   ecosystem management to provide a greater social-ecological system
   understanding. Such a report card was requested on the Gladstone Harbour
   area in central Queensland, Australia. Gladstone Harbour adjoins the
   southern Great Barrier Reef, and is also a major industrial and shipping
   port. Balancing social, economic and environmental interests is
   therefore of great concern to the regional managers. While environmental
   benchmarking procedures are well established within Australia (and
   elsewhere), a method for assessing social and economic performance of
   coastal management is generally lacking. The key aim of this study was
   to develop and pilot a system for the development of a report card
   relating to appropriate cultural, social and economic objectives. The
   approach developed uses a range of multicriteria decision analysis
   methods to assess and combine different qualitative and quantitative
   measures, including the use of Bayesian Belief Networks to combine the
   different measures and provide an overall quantitative score for each of
   the key management objectives. The approach developed is readily
   transferable for purposes of similar assessments in other regions.},

Abstract = {Coastal communities are being impacted by climate change, affecting the
   livelihoods, food security, and wellbeing of residents. Human wellbeing
   is influenced by the heath of the environment through numerous pathways
   and is increasingly being included as a desired outcome in environmental
   management. However, the contributors to wellbeing can be subjective and
   the values and perspectives of decision-makers can affect the aspects of
   wellbeing that are included in planning. We used Q methodology to
   examine how a group of individuals in fisheries management prioritize
   components of wellbeing that may be important to coastal communities in
   the California Current social-ecological system (SES). The California
   Current SES is an integrated system of ecological and human communities
   with complex linkages and connections where commercial fishing is part
   of the culture and an important livelihood. We asked individuals that
   sit on advisory bodies to the Pacific Fisheries Management Council to
   rank 36 statements about coastal community wellbeing, ultimately
   revealing three discourses about how we can best support or improve
   wellbeing in those communities. We examine how the priorities differ
   between the discourses, identify areas of consensus, and discuss how
   these perspectives may influence decision-making when it comes to
   tradeoffs inherent in climate adaptation in fisheries. Lastly, we
   consider if and how thoughts about priorities have been affected by the
   COVID-19 pandemic.},

Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {443-452},

Abstract = {Coral reef fisheries are crucial to the livelihoods of tens of millions
   of people; yet, widespread habitat degradation and unsustainable fishing
   are causing severe depletion of stocks of reef fish. Understanding how
   social and economic factors, such as human population density, access to
   external markets, and modernization interact with fishing and habitat
   degradation to affect fish stocks is vital to sustainable management of
   coral reef fisheries. We used fish survey data, national social and
   economic data, and path analyses to assess whether these factors explain
   variation in biomass of coral reef fishes among 25 sites in Solomon
   Islands. We categorized fishes into 3 groups on the basis of
   life-history characteristics associated with vulnerability to extinction
   by fishing (high, medium, and low vulnerability). The biomass of fish
   with low vulnerability was positively related to habitat condition. The
   biomass of fishes with high vulnerability was negatively related to
   fishing conducted with efficient gear. Use of efficient gear, in turn,
   was strongly and positively related to both population density and
   market proximity. This result suggests local population pressure and
   external markets have additive negative effects on vulnerable reef fish.
   Biomass of the fish of medium vulnerability was not explained by fishing
   intensity or habitat condition, which suggests these species may be
   relatively resilient to both habitat degradation and fishing.},

Abstract = {Seagrass meadows provide provisioning services that play a vital role in
   food security and human wellbeing, especially on the small island.
   However, the utilisation value is uncalculated as support for seafood
   production and livelihoods for the community, because they are
   considered as alternative uses, so that seagrass ecosystem services are
   underestimated and undervalued. This paper aims to show the economic
   value provided by seagrass ecosystem services in providing seafood, both
   as a primary or secondary source. Through field survey and effect on
   production (EOP) analysis shows that capture fisheries and other marine
   biota collecting, both crustacean and mollusc species associated with
   the seagrass ecosystem are utilised directly by coastal communities in
   Derawan Island, Indonesia. Estimates of the economic value of fish and
   marine biota employed in the seagrass ecosystem area are US\$ US\$
   13,488.80 and US\$ 35,744.69 per hectare per year, respectively, or a
   total of US\$ 49,233.49 per hectare per year. This value demonstrates
   the potential importance of seagrass ecosystems. Unfortunately, these
   benefit values have not been fully understood by the communities, so
   that many people ignore the function of seagrass ecosystem services as
   provisioning services, although in the scarcity the utilisation of the
   seagrass ecosystem is quite intensive. Hence, the precautionary
   principle and suggesting conservation actions in a participatory manner
   is challenging to implement.},

Abstract = {Marine renewable energy (MRE), though a relative newcomer to the ocean
   and coastal commons, has become a significant driver of marine spatial
   planning in the US, posing particular challenges to commercial fisheries
   and fishing communities. State and federal agencies with primary
   oversight for MRE development have focused on the identification of
   places where MRE might proceed unhindered by other uses, most notably
   coastal fisheries. These agencies and MRE developers have focused on
   potential space-use conflict and standard mitigation measures for loss
   of access to that space. However, discussions with fishery participants
   and other community members, as well as observations of processes on the
   US West and East Coasts, reveal a complex, multi-faceted
   social-ecological system not easily parsed out among users, nor amenable
   to classic mitigation formulas. Recent ethnographic research on
   potential space-use conflicts and mitigation for MRE demonstrates that
   marine space use is dynamic and multi-dimensional, with important
   linkages among fisheries, communities and other interests. Although
   experiences vary within and across regions and fishing communities, this
   research illustrates the weak position of fishing communities in marine
   spatial planning in the context of MRE development. This paper considers
   the implications of MRE for US East and West Coast fisheries and fishing
   communities situated within the larger context of neoliberalism and
   commodification of the ocean commons. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.. All rights

Abstract = {Small-scale fisheries in coral reef areas support the livelihoods of
   millions of people worldwide. Anthropogenic impacts such as overfishing
   and climate change increasingly threaten both the reef ecosystem and the
   livelihood security of the people that depend on the reefs. Adaptive
   management strategies are needed to adequately deal with these threats,
   but they require an understanding of the underlying drivers, which often
   originate and act on multiple levels. Using a social-ecological system
   approach, the coral reef fishery of the Spermonde Archipelago in South
   Sulawesi/Indonesia is assessed to identify key drivers and strategic
   leverage points for management. Under the influence of international
   markets and technological changes, several export-oriented fisheries
   have developed in the area that led to distinct subsequent peaks in
   fishing activity in a pattern of sequential marine resource
   exploitation. In response to stressors such as seasonality and
   overfishing of individual locations or species, a number of coping
   strategies have developed locally. These include extensive borrowing
   from fishing patrons, diversification of fishing methods, fishing
   migrations, and the crafting of local institutions to regulate fishing
   activity. However, the coping strategies hinder, and even decrease, the
   capacity of the system to adapt to future stressors and undermine the
   sustainability of the fishery. Potential strategies that target
   different levels of the fishery system in order to strengthen adaptive
   management are identified.},

Title = {Examining linkages between ecosystem services and social wellbeing to
   improve governance for coastal conservation in Jamaica},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {39},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This research examines perceptions of the linkages between ecosystem
   services (ES) and social wellbeing in a smallscale fishing community in
   Bluefields, Jamaica. It analyzes the perceived changes to these linkages
   based on the impacts of a marine protected area (MPA) on this coastal
   social-ecological system. MPAs can have positive long-term social and
   ecological effects, but in the short-term they can negatively impact
   communities, and careful attention to these impacts is needed to achieve
   positive conservation outcomes. We conducted 42 semi-structured
   interviews and six focus groups discussions with community members in
   Bluefields. Key findings from this research include: 1) the importance
   of provisioning (e.g., fish, lobster) and cultural ES (e.g., cultural
   heritage, bequest values) and their bundled qualities to both fishers
   and non-fishers; 2) the perceived impact of the MPA is highest for
   inshore fishers, while offshore fishers/non-fishers reported few/no
   negative impacts; and 3) inshore fishers perceive being more
   marginalized in governance processes, despite reporting the greatest
   negative change to ES access and social wellbeing from MPA
   implementation. The results suggest that governance processes for
   coastal conservation must acknowledge the individual and shared values
   of coastal areas and traditional livelihoods to achieve long-term
   legitimacy and support.},

Abstract = {Climate shocks can reorganize the social-ecological linkages in
   food-producing communities, leading to a sudden loss of key products in
   food systems. The extent and persistence of this reorganization are
   difficult to observe and summarize, but are critical aspects of
   predicting and rapidly assessing community vulnerability to extreme
   events. We apply network analysis to evaluate the impact of a climate
   shock-an unprecedented marine heatwave-on patterns of resource use in
   California fishing communities, which were severely affected through
   closures of the Dungeness crab fishery. The climate shock significantly
   modified flows of users between fishery resources during the closures.
   These modifications were predicted by pre-shock patterns of resource use
   and were associated with three strategies used by fishing community
   member vessels to respond to the closures: temporary exit from the food
   system, spillover of effort from the Dungeness crab fishery into other
   fisheries, and spatial shifts in where crab were landed. Regional
   differences in resource use patterns and vessel-level responses
   highlighted the Dungeness crab fishery as a seasonal ``gilded trap{''}
   for northern California fishing communities. We also detected
   disparities in climate shock response based on vessel size, with larger
   vessels more likely to display spatial mobility. Our study demonstrates
   the importance of highly connected and decentralized networks of
   resource use in reducing the vulnerability of human communities to
   climate shocks.},

Abstract = {Through the construction of a socio-ecological timeline for the
   Porsanger fjord ecosystem, this article illustrates the different ways
   in which environmental and social-ecological changes have influenced the
   adaptations of rural households in coastal Sami communities in Finnmark,
   north Norway. The main finding is that, although environmental change in
   the form of seal invasions and dwindling fish stocks directly impacted
   the fisheries, the introduction of a new vessel quota system decisively
   changed adaptive capacity and coastal Sami household adaptation
   strategies. These changes represented a tipping point for the
   social-ecological system in the period between 1986 and 1990. It is thus
   important to discuss the ways in which governance systems may facilitate
   actions to adapt to climate and biodiversity change and foster
   sustainable rural livelihood systems in coastal Norway. Based on
   traditional and local ecological knowledge on the state of the ecosystem
   prior to the tipping point, two relevant actions to increase the
   resilience of the system were identified: ensuring the possibility of
   re-entry into fisheries as part of rural livelihood combinations, and
   ecological restoration of kelp beds. Flexible diversification of
   livelihoods allows exploitation of a range of adjacent species without
   large investments in a fossile fuel-driven fisheries economy. Investing
   in regrowth of macroalgae to foster cod nursery areas and increase
   carbon sequestration can be a relevant alternative for communities that
   are interested in contributing to climate change mitigation on a larger
   scale.},

Abstract = {Are coastal communities relevant in fisheries management? Starting from
   what Svein Jentoft has had to say about the topic, we explore the idea
   that viable fishing communities require viable fish stocks, and viable
   fish stocks require viable fishing communities. To elaborate and expand
   on Jentoft's arguments, first, we discuss values as a key attribute of
   communities that confer the ability to manage coastal resources. Turning
   to power, next we explore why fishing communities need to be empowered
   by having the opportunity to self-manage or co-manage resources. Third,
   regarding community viability, we make the argument that (1) rebuilding
   or maintaining viable fishing communities and fish stocks cannot succeed
   without first dealing with vulnerabilities, and that (2) the dimensions
   of vulnerability involve increase/decrease in well-being, better/poorer
   access to capitals, and building/losing resilience. The idea that
   healthy fishing communities and healthy fish stocks require one another
   implies a viable system that contains both, a social-ecological system
   view. The values embedded in communities enable them to manage
   resources. Thus, managers and policy makers need to imagine healthy
   fishing communities who take care of resources, and this positive image
   of communities is more likely than present policies to lead to viable
   fishing communities as well as viable fish stocks.},

Title = {Multiple method modelling reveals lack of robustness in natural resource
   management research},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {281},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Research on natural resource management like fisheries, irrigation
   systems or forestry traditionally uses case studies providing us with a
   rich, in-depth perspective on many single systems. This comes with a
   disadvantage - lacking comparability as differences between studies
   exist in variables examined, their operationalization or methods used.
   Thus, studies often disagree on important drivers for ecological
   success. However, due to design differences the reasons behind different
   results often remain unknown. One reason might be the impact of method
   choice. Hence, this article tests the influence of methods on model
   results. We use a high-quality data set, the Nepal Irrigation
   Institutions and Systems database (NIIS), developed at the Ostrom
   Workshop. It contains 263 cases, each record having information on
   around 600 variables. Multiple machine learning methods - random forests
   (RF), gradient boosting (GBM), shallow neural networks (SNN) and deep
   neural networks (DNN) - are compared with a standard statistical
   approach (multivariate linear regressions (MLR)). We try to answer the
   question whether these methods differ in estimating the relevance for
   success of such well-known concepts like participation of users,
   resource size, relations with other groups, and social capital among
   others. The results indicate that both agreements and substantial
   differences exist across methods which casts doubt on the robustness of
   previous results. Hence, we advise more caution in interpreting existing
   results. We see this research as a step towards increasing the
   robustness of results and improving both generalisability and
   reproducibility of natural resource management research.},

Title = {The interplay between top-down interventions and bottom-up
   self-organization shapes opportunities for transforming self-governance
   in small-scale fisheries},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {128},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Small-scale fisheries (SSF) contribute substantially to global food
   security, sustainable marine ecosystems and poverty alleviation. Yet
   many SSF face problems of overexploitation and poverty calling for novel
   governance approaches that enhance human-wellbeing, equity and
   ecological sustainability. External policies and interventions to
   support such governance transformations, however, need to take their
   often self-governed nature into account. Common practices based on
   informal arrangements between different fishery actors can make
   existing, mal-adapted structures very persistent and hence difficult to
   overcome. Here we combine multi-method empirical research on SSF in
   Mexico with agent-based modeling to analyze if and under which
   conditions interventions can shift ongoing self-organizing dynamics into
   directions that support the new governance form. We are particularly
   interested in the effectiveness of two different types of interventions,
   financial and social, and their performance under variable social and
   ecological conditions as commonly found in SSF. Our analysis reveals
   that a combination of financial and social support during extended
   periods of time is necessary to ensure persistence of new governance
   forms in face of competition with established forms, as well as
   environmental and social uncertainty. The findings highlight the
   importance of understanding the endogenous self-organizing dynamics
   created by the interplay between social (e.g. the dynamics of trust) and
   ecological (e.g. resource dynamics) processes in order to devise
   policies and measures to initiate a shift towards more sustainable
   pathways.},

Abstract = {Resource users' perceptions are crucial for successful marine governance
   because they affect community support, participation and legitimacy.
   Efforts have been made to understand how fishers' attitudes,
   understandings and interpretations of the environment and its governance
   emerge in small-scale fisheries. However, many quantitative studies have
   focused on how individual-level attributes like socio-demographics are
   associated with perceptions, ignoring a fundamental scale at which
   humans arrive at their views about the world the - social group. In
   multi-gear fisheries, fishers typically cluster in two overlapping types
   of group: occupational groups (defined by fishing gear) and village
   communities. Taking into account also individual-level variables, which
   group type is more associated with particular environmental and
   governance perceptions, e.g. about change in fish stocks, collective
   action or appropriate management actions? Through questionnaires in
   combination with multivariate and multi-model inference, this study
   reveals that, among fishers in two villages in Zanzibar (n = 172),
   village is more associated with perceptions than occupational group or
   any other factor. Further, individual attributes like education and age
   influence perceptions. The main finding implies that the role of social
   cultural processes might have been underestimated in quantitative
   research on research users' perceptions. This has consequences for
   policy and research and shows that both can be informed by statistical
   analyses that disentangles effects of different levels of group
   belonging.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Global scale drivers such as international markets for shrimp can
   trigger large changes at local and regional scales. But there is also a
   poorly appreciated reverse process, operating from the bottom up, with
   potential for triggering changes at higher scales. Thus, effects of
   drivers can be seen as a two-way process in which global drivers and
   local and regional drivers can potentially impact each other. Here, we
   argue that not only can global drivers impact the sustainability of
   local and regional social-ecological systems, but sustainability at
   higher scales can also be impacted by changes at the scale of local and
   regional social-ecological systems. Using Chilika, a large lagoon on the
   Bay of Bengal, Odisha State in India as a case, we show that traditional
   small-scale capture fisheries supporting 150 fisher villages with some
   400,000 people were marginalized by aquaculture development for tiger
   prawn and by state-driven hydrological interventions, with impacts on
   the ecology of the lagoon. These changes, in turn, contribute to global
   poverty and food insecurity, making it difficult for India to meet
   international targets such as millennium development goals. The
   marginalized fisherfolk become part of environmental justice and other
   social movements. With large parts of the lagoon converted into a
   virtual monoculture for the production of tiger prawn, changes in
   Chilika (a Ramsar site) contribute to wetland habitat loss at the global
   scale, and biodiversity losses, possibly including IUCN red-listed
   species.},

Abstract = {Worldwide coral reef conditions continue to decline despite the valuable
   socioeconomic benefits of these ecosystems. There is growing recognition
   that quantifying reefs in terms reflecting what stakeholders value is
   vital for comparing inherent tradeoffs among coastal management
   decisions. Terrestrial sediment runoff ranks high as a stressor to coral
   reefs and is a key concern in Puerto Rico where reefs are among the most
   threatened in the Caribbean. This research aimed to identify the degree
   to which sediment runoff impacts production of coral reef ecosystem
   services and the potential for watershed management actions to improve
   these services. Ecosystem service production functions were applied to
   map and translate metrics of ecological reef condition into ecosystem
   service production under a gradient of increasing sediment delivery. We
   found that higher sediment delivery decreased provisioning of most
   ecosystem services, including ecosystem integrity, bioprospecting
   discovery, and reef-based recreational opportunities and fisheries
   production. However, shoreline protection and services with a strong
   contribution from non-reef habitats (e.g., mangroves, seagrasses) were
   higher in locations with high sediment delivery, although there was a
   strong inshore effect suggesting the influence of distance to shore,
   depth, and inshore habitats. Differences among services may indicate
   potential tradeoffs and the need to consider habitat connectivity,
   nursery habitat, accessibility, and sediment buffering. The
   relationships we have identified can be used to link stakeholder values
   to decision alternatives to ensure continued provisioning of these
   services and the well-being of communities.},

Abstract = {Off the western coast of Sumatra among the islands of Pulau Banyak,
   fishing is the primary occupation for the men of Haloban. They are
   self-described ``traditional{''} fishers, using low-tech gear and small
   boats to catch fish, octopus, lobster, and other sealife in the nearby
   coral reefs and mangroves. Women also regularly venture out into the
   deep mud of the mangroves to collect clams. Their efforts to extract
   livelihoods and subsistence from the reefs take place in an open-access
   commons with few formal institutions or enforcement mechanisms to
   regulate resource use. While explicit regulations and customary
   limitations on fishing in the coral reef commons are lacking, Haloban
   fishers improvise some common etiquette and practices that are adaptable
   to the shifting context.
   This case study presents Haloban fishers' use of the commons as situated
   practices, unarticulated and embedded within a complex social ecological
   system. These practices reflect fishers' understanding of, and
   relationship with, their environment, and may represent a nascent form
   of local ``rules-in-use{''}, informing behavior without direct social
   mechanisms for enforcement. This paper presents research collected using
   ethnographic methods, including participant observation at sea. As NGOs
   and government agencies work to craft management plans that share use of
   the reefs with tourism and conservation, a better understanding of
   actual resource use and fishing practice may inform more nuanced,
   adaptable, and truly ``local{''} community-based management. (C) 2014

Title = {Resilient communities? Collapse and recovery of a social-ecological
   system in Arctic Norway},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Fisheries-dependent Sami communities in the Norwegian Arctic face major
   challenges adapting and responding to social-ecological changes. On a
   local scale, communities and households continually adapt and respond to
   interacting changes in natural conditions and governance frameworks.
   Degradation of the marine environment and decline in coastal settlements
   can move social-ecological systems beyond critical thresholds or tipping
   points, where the system irreversibly enters a different state. We
   examined the recent social-ecological history of 2 fjords in Finnmark,
   North Norway, which have coped, over the past 30 years, with the
   collapse of local fish stocks, harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus) and
   red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) invasions, and increasingly
   restrictive resource management regimes. Further, we explored
   similarities and differences in their social-ecological histories and
   discuss how the concepts of resilience and tipping points can be applied
   as analytical tools in empirical studies of community response to
   social-ecological change. We show that although the ecological changes
   in the 2 communities have consisted of similar developments, they have
   been temporally different in ways that may have affected coping
   strategies and influenced the available options at different times. The
   apparent resilience of Sami fishing communities can be understood as the
   result of response strategies employed by communities and households,
   and the economic opportunities that have opened up as a result of a
   combination of ecological change and institutional and political
   reforms.},

Title = {Resilience of a giant clam subsistence fishery in Kiribati to climate
   change},
Journal = {PACIFIC CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Changes in sea surface temperature have historically impacted the coral
   reef habitats of giant clams in Kiribati. However, across many islands
   of Kiribati, the four species of giant clam have largely withstood these
   environmental changes. We adopted and applied a comprehensive resilience
   framework to assess attributes conferring and limiting resilience in the
   Kiribati giant clam data-limited fishery and used knowledge
   co-production and the precautionary principle approach to better
   understand resilience. We found that the resilience of the fishery to
   climate and anthropogenic impacts, as highlighted by local stake- and
   rightholders, will depend on the ability of fishery actors to act
   collectively to implement adaptive governance. We used a gradient of
   human pressure to identify approaches and pathways for improving and
   operationalising climate resilience. Climate change, coupled with human
   impacts, have reduced ecological resilience in the urbanised island of
   South Tarawa. In South Tarawa, governance and social processes are less
   flexible, leading to declines in the local subsistence clam fishery.
   Conversely, on several remote outer islands, where the social-ecological
   system has shown promise in combating these anthropogenic influences,
   the ecological resilience has improved through adaptive community-based
   fisheries management, and the subsistence clam fishery has persisted.
   Our case study demonstrates the importance of a participatory approach
   and local knowledge when assessing climate resilience and identifies a
   pathway of resilience in a data-limited small-scale fishery.},

Title = {Responding to change: Using scenarios to understand how socioeconomic
   factors may influence amplifying or dampening exploitation feedbacks
   among Tanzanian fishers},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {7-12},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Environmental change often requires societies to adapt. In some
   instances, these adaptations can create feedbacks that amplify the
   change. Alternatively, other adaptations may dampen the change. We used
   semi-structured interviews with 240 fishers from nine Tanzanian coastal
   communities to explore responses to four hypothetical scenarios of
   increasingly severe declines in their average catch (10\%, 20\%, 30\%
   and 50\%). Overall, a higher proportion of fishers said they would
   respond to decline using amplifying adaptations (such as fishing harder)
   than dampening adaptations (such as reducing effort), particularly in
   the scenarios with lower levels of decline. We used a redundancy
   analysis to explore whether certain types of responses were related to
   the fishers' socioeconomic characteristics. Fishers that would employ
   amplifying responses had greater economic wealth but lacked options.
   Fishers who would adopt dampening responses possessed characteristics
   associated with having livelihood options. Fishers who would adopt
   neither amplifying nor dampening responses were less likely to belong to
   community groups and sold the largest proportion of their catch. This
   study provides novel contributions by differentiating aspects of
   adaptive capacity that will amplify versus dampen environmental change
   and by highlighting what the resource users' themselves say regarding
   responding to environmental change. Although direct policy application
   is limited by the study's hypothetical scenario nature, it provides a
   good beginning to incorporating resource users' voices into such policy
   discussions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {45-61},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Fisheries systems are shaped by dynamic social-ecological interactions
   that determine their capacity to provide ecosystem services. Human
   adaptation is often considered a key uncertainty, and there are few
   quantitative empirical analyses that address long-term social and
   ecological change in the analyses of fisheries systems. The aim of this
   study was twofold: (i) to understand how different drivers influenced
   the adaptations by fishers, and (ii) to evaluate different consequences
   of such adaptations, especially with regard to diversity of social and
   ecological links. We used the Baltic Sea as a case study, a system with
   different fisheries, largely managed with a single-stock advice, in a
   top-down basis. The study period 1995-2009 was characterized by profound
   inter-annual fluctuations in fish stock status and prices, and
   introduction of new types of management measures. We used multivariate
   statistical methods to define longitudinal changes in fishing tactics
   and strategies based on logbook data. Our results indicate that changes
   in fishing strategies have mainly been driven by regulations, and there
   were only weak linkages between fishing activities, fish stocks, and
   price fluctuations. We found contrasting trends between large- and
   small-scale fishers, where large-scale fishers became more specialized
   and inflexible, whereas small-scale fishers diversified over time. We
   conclude that management has had a dominating role in shaping fishing
   patterns, leading to a reduction of important qualities related to the
   resilience in this social-ecological system.},

Title = {The economic contribution of sea angling from charter boats: A case
   study from the south coast of England},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {119},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Marine Recreational Fisheries (MRF) provide important socio-economic
   contributions to coastal communities in the UK. Quantifying the
   contribution to coastal economies enables policy makers to plan for the
   sustainable development of these activities and consider trade-offs
   resulting from the implementation of regulations. Highlighting the
   importance of MRF enables their integration into fisheries management
   plans, tourism, and coastal infrastructure strategies, yet these effects
   are rarely quantified. In this study, the economic contribution of
   charter boat sea angling on coastal communities was assessed for four
   ports in Dorset on the South coast of England (Poole, Swanage, Weymouth
   and Portland). Poole and Weymouth have the largest charter fleets in the
   UK. Valuations from Poole and Swanage, as well as Weymouth and Portland
   were used alongside the numbers of boats in the fleet to estimate a
   cumulative economic impact to Dorset from charter boat activity of 2.4
   pound million in gross output and providing about 3.6 pound million in
   estimated economic contribution and over 1.3 pound million of Gross
   Value Added (GVA). Future fisheries management should consider impacts
   and benefits when developing strategies for MRF, potentially
   distinguishing between different parts of the sector. This is
   particularly important for the charter fleet, as they are small
   businesses that rely on the value they generate to operate as businesses
   rather than being a pure recreational activity.},

Title = {When push comes to shove in recreational fishing compliance, think
   `nudge'},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {95},
Pages = {256-266},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Enforcing compliance with rules and regulations in recreational
   fisheries has proved difficult due to factors such as the high number of
   participants and costs of enforcement, the absence of regular monitoring
   of recreational fishing activity, and the inherent difficulties in
   accurately determining catch levels. The effectiveness of traditional
   punitive deterrence is limited, yet current management is heavily
   reliant on this compliance approach. In this paper, the potential of
   behavioural based management is considered through a narrative review of
   the relevant literature; specifically, exploring the use of nudges,
   which aim through subtle changes and indirect suggestion to make certain
   decisions more salient, thereby improving voluntary compliance. This
   concept is explored with specific reference to the compliance of fishers
   within Australian recreational fisheries. There are only a few examples
   of behavioural based approaches found. However, based on their
   theoretical foundations, nudges may represent an inexpensive, and
   potentially highly effective tool for recreational fisheries management.
   Nudges do not offer a `quick fix' to cases where traditional policy
   instruments have failed. Rather, there is the potential for behavioural
   nudges (based on framing, changing the physical environment, presenting
   default options, and social norms) to augment and complement existing
   deterrence regimes. A number of potential nudges for compliance
   management in recreational fisheries are suggested, but caution is
   advised. As with any novel management approach, nudges must be
   rigorously tested to demonstrate their cost-effectiveness and to avoid
   unintended consequences.},

Title = {Mobility in the mangroves: Catch rates, daily decisions, and dynamics of
   artisanal fishing in a coastal commons},

Abstract = {This paper integrates institutional theories of the commons with
   insights from geography and human behavioral ecology to explore the
   spatial and temporal dynamics of artisanal fishing in Ecuador's coastal
   mangrove swamps. The focus is on the cockle fishery commons
   characterized by a mixture of formal institutional arrangements and an
   informal division of fishing space that partially influences fisher
   decisions about where and when to fish. Individual decisions are further
   explained to a certain degree by the patch choice model since fishers
   often move on to new grounds when their catch rates fall below average.
   These optimizing strategies requiring rotation within a socially
   produced fishing space may contribute to resource renewal, perceived
   reliable returns for individuals, and a relative stability in fishing
   effort, potentially mitigating against resource depletion in open-access
   areas not managed as a common property regime. This study of the
   interaction between shellfish harvesters, cultural institutions, and the
   environment contributes to a spatially explicit theory of the commons
   and points to the crucial role of resource user mobility and dynamic
   cultural institutions for the ecological sustainability of shellfish
   fisheries. A better understanding of feedback between individual
   decision-making and the self-organization of a social-ecological system
   has critical implications for policy design and fisheries management at
   similar scales. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Analyzing drivers of fish biomass and biodiversity within community fish
   refuges in Cambodia},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Freshwater social-ecological systems are shaped by site-specific
   characteristics, environmental change and annual fluctuations, and the
   actions of resource users and managers. Our primary aim is to analyze
   the relative effects of these multifacted forces on fishery productivity
   and biodiversity using the case of community-managed protected areas
   within Cambodia's rice field fisheries, known as community fish refuges.
   Our secondary aim is to take advantage of fixed-effects regression
   models, a rigorous approach that is common in other disciplines, yet
   novel to analysis of social-ecological system productivity, and allows
   comparison of each site to itself across time using observational data.
   We analyze the relative associations of site characteristics, annual
   fluctuations, biophysical modifications (e.g., deepening, creation of
   inlet/outlets, etc.), and governance capacity (i.e., community committee
   meeting intensity, fundraising to support illegal fishing patrols, etc.)
   with fish biomass and biodiversity within 40 refuges over three years.
   We find that seasonal and site-specific effects within this system
   relate strongly to biomass and species richness patterns. We also find
   an association between biomass and biodiversity and some elements of
   governance capacity building. Our findings suggest that in this setting
   solutions tailored and responsive to the local context may be most
   appropriate given the strong interannual and site-specific drivers.
   Methodologically, the dynamism and site specificity of such systems
   befits within-site comparisons over long time horizons to appreciate the
   factors that drive biomass and biodiversity.},

Title = {Disentangling seafood value chains: Tourism and the local market driving
   small-scale fisheries},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {74},
Pages = {33-42},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Identifying socio-economic drivers of small-scale fisheries is a
   fundamental step to understand impacts and pressures on fishery
   resources, and the behaviour of seafood trade actors. It is especially
   relevant for developing countries where such information is usually
   lacking and fisheries management is greatly needed. To address this gap,
   this study maps the structure of value chains of fish and marine
   invertebrates caught by small-scale fisheries from Sao Vicente, Cape
   Verde (West Africa), and examines the main socio-economic drivers behind
   the seafood trade on the island. Specifically, it shows how drivers,
   such as tourism and the local market, shape the preferences for certain
   species and how they affect the distribution of income among actors
   involved in the seafood trade. To collect this information, interviews
   were done with fishers, small-scale traders, market vendors, and
   restaurant owners, in all fishing communities of the island of Sao
   Vicente, in 2015. Tourism and the local market drive the exploitation of
   a wide variety of marine species, from small demersal low trophic level
   fish and marine invertebrates, to large pelagic high trophic level fish
   species. Moreover, the local seafood market, and especially tourism
   dynamics, contribute to the unequal distribution of income among actor
   groups, benefiting mostly restaurant owners due to their direct access
   to tourist consumers. Such findings have implications for local fishery
   resources management, food security, and fishing communities'
   livelihoods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Transformation in times of climate change: what makes a fisher diversify
   livelihoods?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {Despite the importance of livelihood diversification as a transformation
   strategy in small-scale fisheries facing climate change, empirical
   evidence on this complex phenomenon is scarce. This work aims to shed
   light on factors that help to explain the transformative behavior of
   small-scale fishers when faced with climate change impacts. Using
   primary survey data from 404 small-scale fishers across 9 communities in
   Galicia, NW Spain, we examined how different aspects of fishers'
   adaptive capacities relate to their stated decisions to engage in
   livelihood diversification when faced with hypothetical climate change
   scenarios. The results of our multinomial multilevel mixed-effect logit
   model show that flexibility (current income diversification level and
   diversity of target fishery resources) has a strong, positive
   relationship with livelihood diversification responses. In contrast,
   learning, social organization, and competing concerns played a complex
   role. Specifically, we found that social-ecological system knowledge,
   communication with different fishing groups (bridging communication),
   trust in institutional actors, and gender (female) were positively
   related to livelihood diversification when faced with climate impacts.
   Fishing experience, communication within fishing groups (bonding
   communication), and trust in other fishing groups (bridging trust) were
   negatively related to diversification. Our results provide new empirical
   evidence on the factors associated with fisher's decisions to engage in
   livelihood diversification when faced with climate impacts on fishery
   resources, lending critical insight for climate adaptation programs and
   policies.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {As part of an international collaboration to compare large-scale
   commons, we used the Social-Ecological Systems Meta-Analysis Database
   (SESMAD) to systematically map out attributes of and changes in the
   Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) in Australia. We focus on eight
   design principles from common-pool resource (CPR) theory and other key
   social-ecological systems governance variables, and explore to what
   extent they help explain the social and ecological outcomes of park
   management through time. Our analysis showed that commercial fisheries
   management and the re-zoning of the GBRMP in 2004 led to improvements in
   ecological condition of the reef, particularly fisheries. These boundary
   and rights changes were supported by effective monitoring, sanctioning
   and conflict resolution. Moderate biophysical connectivity was also
   important for improved outcomes. However, our analysis also highlighted
   that continued challenges to improved ecological health in terms of
   coral cover and biodiversity can be explained by fuzzy boundaries
   between land and sea, and the significance of external drivers to even
   large-scale social-ecological systems (SES). While ecological and
   institutional fit in the marine SES was high, this was not the case when
   considering the coastal SES. Nested governance arrangements become even
   more important at this larger scale. To our knowledge, our paper
   provides the first analysis linking the re-zoning of the GBRMP to CPR
   and SES theory. We discuss important challenges to coding large-scale
   systems for meta-analysis.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Environmental changes caused by climate change in Alaska pose a serious
   threat to the food, energy and water systems that support the culturally
   diverse communities statewide. The fishing industry, watershed managers
   and other stakeholders struggle with understanding and predicting the
   rates, magnitude and location of changes occurring in their regions
   primarily because of the significant range of uncertainty inherent in
   these changes. With the guidance of stakeholders, we demonstrate a
   scenario analysis methodology to elucidate the interactions among
   various components and uncertainties within the food, energy and water
   systems of the Kenai River Watershed. Alternative scenario analysis
   provided stakeholders with a venue and process to consider plausible
   futures in which rates of change in critical uncertainties were modeled
   to elucidate potential responses. Critical uncertainties ranged from
   climatic impacts on freshwater systems, to new energy development
   proposals, to changes in sport and personal use fisheries. Working
   together, stakeholders developed narratives that reflected different
   combinations of future uncertainty to guide potential management actions
   now and in the future. Five scenarios were developed by stakeholders
   that capture the complex interactions in the Kenai River Watershed as a
   social-ecological system. This process provides a way for managers and
   stakeholders to plan for the future in a richer way than extrapolating
   trends for obvious drivers of change. We present this framework as a
   platform for integrating climate, landscape and cultural change data
   into actionable decisions, crafted by stakeholders, to improve future
   food, energy and water resource management at the watershed scale.},

Abstract = {Managing ecosystems for multiple ecosystem services and balancing the
   well-being of diverse stakeholders involves different kinds of
   trade-offs. Often trade-offs involve noneconomic and
   difficult-to-evaluate values, such as cultural identity, employment, the
   well-being of poor people, or particular species or ecosystem
   structures. Although trade-offs need to be considered for successful
   environmental management, they are often overlooked in favor of
   win-wins. Management and policy decisions demand approaches that can
   explicitly acknowledge and evaluate diverse trade-offs. We identified a
   diversity of apparent trade-offs in a small-scale tropical fishery when
   ecological simulations were integrated with participatory assessments of
   social-ecological system structure and stakeholders' well-being. Despite
   an apparent win-win between conservation and profitability at the
   aggregate scale, food production, employment, and well-being of
   marginalized stakeholders were differentially influenced by management
   decisions leading to trade-offs. Some of these trade-offs were suggested
   to be ``taboo{''} trade-offs between morally incommensurable values,
   such as between profits and the well-being of marginalized women. These
   were not previously recognized as management issues. Stakeholders
   explored and deliberated over trade-offs supported by an interactive
   ``toy model{''} representing key system trade-offs, alongside
   qualitative narrative scenarios of the future. The concept of taboo
   trade-offs suggests that psychological bias and social sensitivity may
   exclude key issues from decision making, which can result in policies
   that are difficult to implement. Our participatory modeling and
   scenarios approach has the potential to increase awareness of such
   trade-offs, promote discussion of what is acceptable, and potentially
   identify and reduce obstacles to management compliance.},

Abstract = {Tundra ecosystems are vulnerable to hydrocarbon development, in part
   because small-scale, low-intensity disturbances can affect vegetation,
   permafrost soils, and wildlife out of proportion to their spatial
   extent. Scaling up to include human residents, tightly integrated arctic
   social-ecological systems (SESs) are believed similarly susceptible to
   industrial impacts and climate change. In contrast to northern Alaska
   and Canada, most terrestrial and aquatic components of West Siberian oil
   and gas fields are seasonally exploited by migratory herders, hunters,
   fishers, and domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus L.). Despite
   anthropogenic fragmentation and transformation of a large proportion of
   the environment, recent socioeconomic upheaval, and pronounced climate
   warming, we find the Yamal-Nenets SES highly resilient according to a
   few key measures. We detail the remarkable extent to which the system
   has successfully reorganized in response to recent shocks and evaluate
   the limits of the system's capacity to respond. Our analytical approach
   combines quantitative methods with participant observation to understand
   the overall effects of rapid land use and climate change at the level of
   the entire Yamal system, detect thresholds crossed using surrogates, and
   identify potential traps. Institutional constraints and drivers were as
   important as the documented ecological changes. Particularly crucial to
   success is the unfettered movement of people and animals in space and
   time, which allows them to alternately avoid or exploit a wide range of
   natural and anthropogenic habitats. However, expansion of
   infrastructure, concomitant terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem
   degradation, climate change, and a massive influx of workers underway
   present a looming threat to future resilience.},

Title = {How cybernetics explains institutional failure: A case of Greenland's
   open-air fish markets},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {117},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Understanding why institutions fail is a major concern for natural
   resource governance. In systems where resources are managed locally,
   failure is often attributed to the rules poorly fitting the
   social-ecological system. But what might also bring failure is the
   manner with which the rules are `fitted' to the system. This paper
   argues that the conceptual development of institutional failure could be
   made more tenable with cybernetics - the science of control and
   feedback. In our case study and process tracing of a `market'
   institution (an open-air fish market in Greenland), we show how recently
   implemented European food safety regulations have generated unintended
   negative consequences, limiting Inuit access to marine foodstuffs,
   altering the social characteristics of food exchange, and giving rise to
   underground markets for marine foods. These outcomes signal the failure
   of reforms to this market institution, but not necessarily why it
   failed. We show how cybernetic orders explain institutional failure,
   focusing on how command-and-control-style decisions to intervene in
   marine food trading and handling (considered as the first-order
   cybernetics) fostered public doubt for the scientific expertise
   underpinning the reforms, and ultimately led to a public rejection and
   closure of a new, hygienic, multi-million-dollar marketplace for marine
   foods. We clarify how second-order cybernetic elements - such as
   legitimacy, reflexivity, co-design, and interaction among governance
   actors - could have prevented the observed outcome. Our case expands the
   conceptual development of institutional failure and clarifies how the
   lens of cybernetics can inform the study and practice of institutional
   change in fisheries governance.},

Title = {The paraty artisanal fishery (southeastern Brazilian coast):
   ethnoecology and management of a social-ecological system (SES)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {This study intends to give recommendations to the management of Paraty
   fishery in Brazil through an interplay of local and scientific
   knowledge. In particular, the objectives are the following: 1) to
   describe the Paraty fishery; 2) to compare the fishermen's local
   ecological knowledge with recorded fish landings and previous studies in
   Paraty; 3) to combine the data on local fishing and on local/Caicara
   livelihoods with the SES (social-ecological systems) Model. The methods
   include a systematic survey of fishing in Tarituba and Praia Grande,
   which are located in the northern end and the central part of the Paraty
   municipality, respectively. For four days each month, systematic data on
   catches at landing points were collected, as well as macroscopic gonad
   analysis data for the fishes Centropomus parallelus and C. undecimalis
   (snook, robalo), Epinephelus marginatus (grouper, garoupa),
   Scomberomorus cavalla (King mackerel, cavala), and Lutjanus synagris
   (Lane snapper, vermelho). Spring and summer are important seasons during
   which some species reproduce, and the integration of fishing periods for
   some target species could assist in fishing management through the use
   of closed seasons. Fishermen could obtain complementary earnings from
   tourism and from the ``defeso system{''} (closed season including a
   salary payment) to conserve fishing stocks. The SES model facilitates an
   understanding of the historical context of fishing, its economic
   importance for local livelihoods, the constraints from conservation
   measures that affect fishermen, and the management processes that
   already exist, such as the defeso. If used to integrate fishing with
   complementary activities (tourism), such a system could improve the
   responsibility of fishermen regarding the conservation of fish stocks.},

Abstract = {Marine ecosystems are in decline. New transformational changes in
   governance are urgently required to cope with overfishing, pollution,
   global changes, and other drivers of degradation. Here we explore
   social, political, and ecological aspects of a transformation in
   governance of Chile's coastal marine resources, from 1980 to today.
   Critical elements in the initial preparatory phase of the transformation
   were (i) recognition of the depletion of resource stocks, (ii)
   scientific knowledge on the ecology and resilience of targeted species
   and their role in ecosystem dynamics, and (iii) demonstration-scale
   experimental trials, building on smaller-scale scientific experiments,
   which identified new management pathways. The trials improved
   cooperation among scientists and fishers, integrating knowledge and
   establishing trust. Political turbulence and resource stock collapse
   provided a window of opportunity that triggered the transformation,
   supported by new enabling legislation. Essential elements to navigate
   this transformation were the ability to network knowledge from the local
   level to influence the decision-making processes at the national level,
   and a preexisting social network of fishers that provided political
   leverage through a national confederation of artisanal fishing
   collectives. The resultant governance scheme includes a revolutionary
   national system of marine tenure that allocates user rights and
   responsibilities to fisher collectives. Although fine tuning is
   necessary to build resilience of this new regime, this transformation
   has improved the sustainability of the interconnected social-ecological
   system. Our analysis of how this transformation unfolded provides
   insights into how the Chilean system could be further developed and
   identifies generalized pathways for improved governance of marine
   resources around the world.},

Title = {Spatial Modeling of Social-Ecological Management Zones of the Ali'i Era
   on the Island of Kaua'i with Implications for Large-Scale Biocultural
   Conservation and Forest Restoration Efforts in Hawai'i},

Abstract = {Policy makers and resource managers in Hawai'i often look to the ancient
   Hawaiian system of resource management, known as the ahupua'a -system,
   as a holistic and sustainable mountains-to-sea model for restoration of
   social-ecological system health and function. Many components of this
   ancient system, such as agriculture, aquaculture, and nearshore fishery
   management, have been documented, studied, and revived in the name of
   both sustainability and perpetuation of Hawai'i's indigenous culture.
   One relatively glaring hole in the context of our understanding of this
   ancient system is management of forest resources on a system (i.e.,
   large-scale plant community) level. Five terms for identified and
   managed social-ecological zones, wao kanaka, wao la'au, wao nahele, wao
   kele, and wao akua, were used to delineate GIS layers in the model
   ahupua'a of Ha'ena. These were then extrapolated across the entire
   island of Kaua'i. The resulting map indicates that not all ahupua'a on
   Kaua'i had all five social-ecological zones, which gives valuable
   insight into how upland regions of the various ahupua'a may have been
   managed in the ali'i era. This research has implications for
   contemporary approaches to large-scale biocultural conservation
   initiatives and other resource management plans that aim toward having
   broader community support for such efforts. Analysis shows that broad
   overlap between the ancient system and contemporary management zones
   exists, which implies that it may be feasible to adapt this ancient
   approach in the bureaucratic system of the contemporary era.},

   resource managers},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {152},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Seagrass beds have historically received little to no management
   attention, contributing to significant declines in their extent
   globally. Recently, seagrass beds, and other blue carbon ecosystems,
   have gained greater manage-ment attention due to their potentially
   critical role in climate mitigation. Therefore, some countries, such as
   Belize in 2021, have included blue carbon ecosystems within their
   Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). To date, no specific
   regulations exist to manage seagrass beds in Belize; however, there is a
   plan to develop a national seagrass policy. In support of this effort
   and to gain a better understanding of institutions' current knowledge
   and perceptions regarding seagrass beds and their management, as well
   their experiences with community engagement, we conducted interviews
   with six Belizean management institutions (two government departments,
   four non-government organizations) involved in marine resource
   management. Respondents perceived seagrass beds as important,
   identifying climate mitigation and fisheries as critical ecosystem
   services. They saw the importance of managing and protecting seagrass
   beds, and identified several direct (e.g., dredging) and indirect (e.g.,
   land-based pollution) threats. Also highlighted were several management
   challenges, with governance structure identified as a major one;
   seagrass beds can fall under the purview of several government
   departments, which has jurisdictional implications. Interviewees
   discussed challenges and opportunities regarding community engagement,
   and they desired greater community inclusion within marine resource
   management at planning and implementation phases. Based on these
   findings, we build on existing management frameworks to present one that
   can foster just and equitable seagrass policy, management, and
   social-ecological outcomes.},

Title = {The interplay between formal and informal institutions and the potential
   for co-management in a Mexican small-scale fishery},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {121},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Understanding how institutions operate is crucial to the protection of
   marine ecosystems and the communities that depend on them. We define
   institutions as the rules, norms, and practices that govern resource
   users' interactions with common-pool resources, and recognize that both
   formal and informal institutions govern marine fisheries around the
   world. Institutional diversity can enhance social-ecological system
   resilience by providing multiple ways of responding to change.
   Identifying institutions and their effects on fishing practices is key
   to improving management for sustainable fisheries. In this study, we use
   a mixed methods approach focused on the institutions guiding fishing
   activities of the Mexican chocolate clam, Megapitaria squalida, in
   Loreto Bay National Park, Baja California Sur, Mexico. By synthesizing
   long-term observations and semi-structured interviews with fishers and
   other key stakeholders, we identify the formal and informal rules and
   norms governing fishing behavior, explore their effects on fishing
   practices, and illuminate ways in which formal and informal institutions
   may work in tandem. We find that both formal and informal institutions
   shape fishing practices within the chocolate clam fishery. Some
   reinforce one another, and others are in conflict. The diverse
   institutions governing the chocolate clam fishery create a complex web
   of sometimes conflicting rules and social norms that fishers navigate
   every day. We contend that greater community participation in
   management, via polycentric and collaborative governance that accounts
   for and legitimizes local norms in a system like co-management, would
   foster enhanced sustainability of the chocolate clam fishery and the
   benefits it provides to coastal communities.},

Title = {Firewood Collection in South Africa: Adaptive Behavior in
   Social-Ecological Models},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Due to the fact that the South Africa's savanna landscapes are under
   changing conditions, the previously sustainable firewood collection
   system in rural areas has become a social-ecological factor in questions
   about landscape management. While the resilience of savannas in national
   parks such as Kruger National Park (KNP) in South Africa has been widely
   acknowledged in ecosystem management, the resilience of woody vegetation
   outside protected areas has been underappreciated. Collecting wood is
   the dominant source of energy for rural households, and there is an
   urgent need for land management to find sustainable solutions for this
   complex social-ecological system. However, the firewood collection
   scenario is only one example, and stands for all human-ecosystem service
   interactions under the topic of over-utilization, e.g., fishery,
   grazing, harvesting. Agent-based modeling combined with goal-oriented
   action planning (GOAP) can provide fresh insights into the relationship
   between individual needs of humans and changes in land use. At the same
   time, this modeling approach includes adaptive behavior under changing
   conditions. A firewood collection scenario was selected for a
   proof-of-concept comprising households, collectors, ecosystem services
   and firewood sites. Our results have shown that, even when it is
   predictable what a single human agent will do, massive up-scaling is
   needed in order to understand the whole complexity of social-ecological
   systems. Under changing conditions, such as climate and an increasing
   population, fair distribution of natural goods become an important
   issue.},

Abstract = {Mud crabs (Scylla serrata) are the most conspicuous and commercially
   important portunid species in the Indo-Pacific mangroves. In Indian
   Sundarban mangrove, mud crabs are valuable bioresource that contributed
   economically for the coastal communities. The majority of the crab
   fishers use traditional methods with minimal investment and without any
   restriction, resulting unregulated fishery practices. The present study
   aims to identify the status of crab fishery following ecological and
   social aspects over three year's data series. Monthly samplings were
   conducted in seven fishing villages of Sundarban having similar
   principle livelihood and socio-cultural makeup. The population
   structure, abundance, biomass and sex-ratio of the crabs were recorded
   each month. The organization of local marketing chain was analyzed.
   Daily and monthly catch in different traditional fishing techniques were
   compared. Based on the three years survey data a conceptual framework of
   future management strategy had also been developed. Six different size
   classes were identified during the study. Ovigerous ratio and juvenile
   recruitment of the population showed distinct peaks. Two major fishing
   techniques were identified which are practiced traditionally by the
   local communities. They differed in terms of size-specific collection,
   catch per unit effort and hours of activities for the crab collectors.
   Maximum exploitation of the wild population was observed in the case of
   mangrove-fringed villages. Due to the recent increasing demands of mud
   crabs in domestic and international markets, the natural stock is
   continually been depleted. Therefore, involvement of the resource
   extractors into the future management trajectories is necessary to
   overcome the present crisis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Managing water-use trade-offs in a semi-arid river delta to sustain

Year = {2009},
Volume = {24},

Abstract = {Managing trade-offs among water uses in a river basin to sustain
   multiple ecosystem services is crucial for adaptation to changing river
   flow regimes. Here we analyze the trade-off between irrigation and
   fisheries in the Amudarya, a semi-arid river basin in Central Asia,
   using an optimal control and an agent-based modeling approach. With the
   optimal control approach (OCA), we identify the economic and ecological
   conditions for water sharing in a regime where a social manager controls
   water withdrawals and fish harvesting. With the agent-based model (ABM),
   we relax some of the assumptions of the OCA to investigate how
   localized, individual agents with varied water use histories adapt their
   water use activities to local resource conditions. Variation in the
   farmers' initial labor allocations to the two activities results in
   regimes with only one activity or both. Global returns and income
   equality are highest in a mixed regime. The mixed regimes also are more
   robust to water variability because fishing activities can compensate
   for decreased agricultural performance in the midstream regions. Thus,
   allowing for multiple uses can improve the coupled social-ecological
   system's performance and its resilience. We also observe a lock-in
   effect similar to the current situation in the Amudarya, where
   agriculture is the dominant water use and transition to a more balanced
   allocation has proven to be extremely difficult. As in the ABM, this can
   to some extent be attributed to the difficulties of achieving sufficient
   revenues from fishing when agricultural activities upstream are high.
   Regulations or incentives are needed to overcome those barriers, and to
   facilitate progress towards integrated water management.},

Title = {Social-ecological interactions, management panaceas, and the future of

Abstract = {We explored the social and ecological outcomes associated with emergence
   of a management panacea designed to govern a stochastic renewable
   natural resource. To that end, we constructed a model of a coupled
   social-ecological system of recreational fisheries in which a manager
   supports naturally fluctuating stocks by stocking fish in response to
   harvest-driven satisfaction of resource users. The realistic assumption
   of users remembering past harvest experiences when exploiting a
   stochastically fluctuating fish population facilitates the emergence of
   a stocking-based management panacea over time. The social benefits of
   panacea formation involve dampening natural population fluctuations and
   generating stability of user satisfaction. It also maintains the
   resource but promotes the eventual replacement of wild fish by
   hatchery-descended fish. Our analyses show this outcome is particularly
   likely when hatchery-descended fish are reasonably fit (e.g.,
   characterized by similar survival relative to wild fish) and/or when
   natural recruitment of the wild population is low(e.g., attributable to
   habitat deterioration), which leaves the wild population with little
   buffer against competition by stocked fish. The potential for
   release-based panacea formation is particularly likely under user-based
   management regimes and should be common in a range of social-ecological
   systems (e.g., fisheries, forestry), whenever user groups are entitled
   to engage in release or replanting strategies. The net result will be
   the preservation of a renewable resource through user-based incentives,
   but the once natural populations are likely to be altered and to host
   nonnative genotypes. This risks other ecosystem services and the future
   of wild populations.},

Title = {Using mental models to quantify linear and non-linear relationships in
   complex fishery systems},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {132},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Reducing uncertain outcomes of fishery management actions requires an
   understanding of how fishers will be affected by policy actions. This
   requires integrating the local expertise of commercial fishers and
   seafood processors into management planning to predict how regulatory
   changes could impact social-ecological systems. Participatory modeling
   between managers, scientists, and industry can be useful in integrating
   different perspectives and gaining a more comprehensive understanding of
   how different scenarios can cause direct and indirect impacts throughout
   fishery systems. We used group Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping exercises to
   describe the structure and dynamics of two economically important
   commercial fishery systems in Alaska, USA: the Bering Sea Pollock
   Catcher/Processor and Amendment 80 Groundfish fishery. Several
   components were identified by the fleets that had a relatively high
   number of links to other components in each system, including chum
   salmon catch for the pollock fleet and the deck sorting of halibut for
   the groundfish fleet. After identifying other critical relationships
   between regulatory, environmental, and operational changes, we developed
   a survey technique and regression analytical approach to define the
   shape of these relationships. Our results show both linear and nonlinear
   relationships between bycatch regulations and fishing operations; thus,
   providing evidence counter to the traditional assumption that the
   relationships between policy and fishing operations are always linear
   and constant across variable levels of change. Our novel approach
   permits for more specific explorations of curvilinear patterns, social
   tipping points, and asymptotic limits to change, thereby allowing for
   improved assessments of the effects of regulatory and environmental
   change on fishing communities.},

Title = {Collapse of a historic oyster fishery: diagnosing causes and identifying
   paths toward increased resilience},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Diagnosing causal factors of change at the ecosystem level is
   challenging because multiple drivers often interact at various spatial
   and temporal scales. We employ an integrated natural and social science
   approach to assess potential mechanisms leading to the collapse of an
   estuarine social-ecological system, and recommend future paths to
   increased system resilience. Our case study is the collapse of the
   eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) fishery in Apalachicola Bay,
   Florida, USA, and the associated impacts on local resource dependent
   communities. The oyster fishery collapse is the most recent in a series
   of environmental stressors to this region, which have included
   hurricanes and tropical storms, drought, and the Deepwater Horizon oil
   spill. We found it likely that the oyster collapse was not related to
   contamination from the recent oil spill, but rather to factors affecting
   oyster recruitment and survival, which may have been mediated by both
   human, e.g., fishing-related habitat alteration, and environmental,
   e.g., increased natural mortality from predators and disease, factors.
   The relative impact of each of these factors is likely to increase in
   the future because of changing climate and increased demand for fishery,
   water, and petroleum resources. Successful restoration and persistence
   of a viable oyster fishery will depend on: (1) implementation of some
   minimal best management practices, e.g., extensive habitat restoration
   via shell addition, and some spatial closures to harvest, (2) improving
   environmental knowledge and promoting episodic learning through enhanced
   monitoring and experimental management, and (3) continued community
   engagement necessary to produce adaptable governance suitable to
   responding to future unexpected challenges.},

Title = {The challenge of adapting marine social-ecological systems to the
   additional stress of climate change},
Journal = {CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {2},
Number = {5-6},
Pages = {356-363},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A broad marine policy goal is to maintain healthy marine
   social-ecological systems that sustain desirable ecosystem services and
   support human livelihoods. Marine social-ecological systems are already
   stressed by a number of environmental factors and the impacts of
   globalisation. Climate change is an additional stress that may push
   marine social-ecological systems beyond the ranges of past variability
   to which they have become adapted. Human social systems have
   well-developed strategies for dealing with variability within their
   normal ranges of experience, although these capacities are not
   distributed homogeneously around the globe. This paper addresses the
   additional impacts of climate change on marine social-ecological systems
   that are focussed around fishing. For example, human social fishing
   systems dealing with high variability upwelling systems with rapidly
   reproducing fish species may have greater capacities to adjust to the
   additional stress of climate change than human social fishing systems
   focussed on longer-lived and generally less variable species. The
   details of local impacts of climate change and its interactions with
   existing stresses on marine social-ecological systems are difficult to
   predict but will lead to more extreme events and increased uncertainty.
   Management must strive to enhance the adaptive capacities of these
   systems to uncertainty and change. Primary challenges are to address
   non-climate change stresses such as overfishing and how they may
   interact with climate change to produce surprises, and to recognise that
   multiple interacting time, space and organisational scales make
   identification and resolution of impacts difficult. Additional
   challenges are to develop integrated observing and modelling systems for
   the full social-ecological system so as to quickly recognise changes, to
   enhance communications with stakeholders, and to develop flexible
   institutions that can adjust rapidly to new circumstances.},

Title = {A Mitigation Hierarchy Approach for Managing Sea Turtle Captures in
   Small-Scale Fisheries},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {The mitigation hierarchy has been proposed as an overarching framework
   for managing fisheries and reducing marine megafauna bycatch, but
   requires empirical application to show its practical utility. Focusing
   on a small-scale fishing community in Peru as a case study system, we
   test how the mitigation hierarchy can support efforts to reduce captures
   of sea turtles in gillnets and link these actions to broader goals for
   biodiversity. We evaluate three management scenarios by drawing on
   ecological risk assessment (ERA) and qualitative management strategy
   evaluation to assess trade-offs between biological, economic, and social
   considerations. The turtle species of management focus include
   leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea, green turtle Chelonia mydas,
   and olive ridley turtle Lepidochelys olivacea. Adopting a mixed-methods
   iterative approach to data collection, we undertook a literature review
   to collate secondary data on the fishery and the species of turtles
   captured. We then collected primary data to fill the knowledge gaps
   identified, including establishing the spatial extent of the fishery and
   calculating turtle capture rates for the fishery. We identified and
   evaluated the potential risk that the fishery poses to each turtle
   species within Pacific East regional management units using a
   qualitative ERA. Finally, we evaluated potential management strategies
   to reduce turtle captures, incorporating stakeholder preference from
   questionnaire-based surveys and considering preliminary estimates of
   trends across a range of performance indicators. We illustrate how the
   proposed framework can integrate existing knowledge on an issue of
   marine megafauna captures, and incorporate established decision-making
   processes to help identify data gaps. This supports a holistic
   assessment of management strategies toward biodiversity goals
   standardized across fisheries and scales.},

Abstract = {Governing common pool resources (CPR) in the face of disturbances such
   as globalization and climate change is challenging. The outcome of any
   CPR governance regime is the influenced by local combinations of social,
   institutional, and biophysical factors, as well as cross-scale
   interdependencies. In this study, we take a step towards understanding
   multiple-causation of CPR outcomes by analyzing (1) the co-occurrence of
   design principles (DPs) by activity (irrigation, fishery and forestry),
   and (2) the combination(s) of DPs leading to social and ecological
   success. We analyzed 69 cases pertaining to three different activities:
   irrigation, fishery, and forestry. We find that the importance of the
   design principles is dependent upon the natural and hard human made
   infrastructure (i.e. canals, equipment, vessels etc.). For example,
   clearly defined social boundaries are important when the natural
   infrastructure is highly mobile (i.e. tuna fish), while monitoring is
   more important when the natural infrastructure is more static (i.e.
   forests or water contained within an irrigation system). However, we
   also find that congruence between local conditions and rules and
   proportionality between investment and extraction are key for CPR
   success independent from the natural and human hard made infrastructure.
   We further provide new visualization techniques for co-occurrence
   patterns and add to qualitative comparative analysis by introducing a
   reliability metric to deal with a large meta-analysis dataset on
   secondary data where information is missing or uncertain.},

Title = {Microeconomic relationships between and among fishers and traders

   small-scale fishery},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {Understanding the cross-scale nature of how natural resource trading
   links to local extraction patterns remains a topic of great relevance to
   stewardship and sustainable use of ecological systems. Microeconomic
   influences on a society's pattern of small-scale natural resources
   utilization can exacerbate resource overuse, especially under increased
   population pressure. In many rural communities that are based on a
   limited diversity of resource industries, quantifying the response of
   extractors and traders to market and environmental fluctuations is
   critical to understanding management constraints. We examine the fishing
   practices of a small lake in Uganda, East Africa, from the dual
   perspectives of the traders and the fishers using a Bayesian Belief
   Network approach based on detailed interview surveys. Fishers in this
   small lake target Nile perch (Lates niloticus) and Nile tilapia
   (Oreochromis niloticus), two fish species of high commercial and food
   security significance in East Africa. We combined data on financial,
   social, and ecological systems to understand how aspects of trading
   quantitatively relate to fish extraction patterns in Lake Nabugabo
   Uganda. Importantly, we find that the patron-client type relationships
   generate incentives to extract specific fish, whereas ``freelancer{''}
   independent fishers are able to create responsive and flexible
   extraction practices that match market and environmental fluctuations.
   Management of fishing administered by local Beach Management Units will
   likely have a higher probability of success when in synchrony with
   trading relationships and ecological dynamics. We use this study in
   Uganda to reflect on methodological challenges and opportunities of
   combining multiple types of data sets for cross-scale analysis of
   social-ecological system dynamics.},

Title = {Identifying cost-effective invasive species control to enhance
   endangered species populations in the Grand Canyon, USA},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {220},
Pages = {12-20},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Recovering endangered species populations when confronted with the
   threat of invasive species is an ongoing natural resource management
   challenge. While eradication of the invasive species is often the
   optimal economic solution, it may not be a feasible nor desirable
   management action in other cases. For example, when invasive species are
   desired in one area, but disperse into areas managed for endangered
   species, managers may be interested in persistent, but cost-effective
   means of managing dispersers rather than eradicating the source. In the
   Colorado River, a nonnative rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) sport
   fishery is desired within Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, however,
   dispersal downriver into the Grand Canyon National Park is not desired
   as rainbow trout negatively affect endangered humpback chub (Gila
   cypha). Here, we developed a bioeconomic model incorporating population
   abundance goals and cost-effectiveness analyses to approximate the
   optimal control strategies for invasive rainbow trout conditional on
   achieving endangered humpback chub adult population abundance goals.
   Model results indicated that the most cost-effective approach to achieve
   target adult humpback chub abundance was a high level of rainbow trout
   control over moderately high rainbow trout population abundance. Adult
   humpback chub abundance goals were achieved at relatively low rainbow
   trout abundance and control measures were not cost-effective at
   relatively high rainbow trout abundance. Our model considered population
   level dynamics, species interaction and economic costs in a
   multi-objective decision framework to provide a preferred solution to
   long-run management of invasive and native species.},

Abstract = {The monitoring of ecosystems and the spread of information concerning
   their state among human stakeholders is often a lengthy process. The
   importance of mutual feedbacks between socioeconomic and ecological
   dynamics is being increasingly recognised in recent studies, but it is
   generally assumed that the feedback from the environment is
   instantaneous, ignoring any delay in the spread of ecosystem knowledge
   and the resulting potential for system stability loss. On the other
   hand, human actors rarely make purely myopic socioeconomic decisions as
   is often assumed. Rather, they show a degree of foresight for future
   utility which may have an opposing, stabilising effect to any delay in
   knowledge. In this paper, we consider a generic resource-harvester model
   with delayed ecosystem knowledge and predictive behaviour by the
   harvesters. We show that delays in the spread of information about the
   resource level can destabilise the bioeconomic equilibrium in the system
   and induce harvesting cycles or the collapse of the resource.
   Sufficiently farsighted prediction by the harvesters can stabilise the
   system, provided the delay is not too long. However, if the time horizon
   of prediction is too long relative to the timescale of resource growth,
   prediction can be destabilising even in the absence of delay. The
   results imply that effective monitoring of ecosystems and fast
   dissemination of the results are necessary for their sustainable use and
   that efforts to promote appropriate foresight among ecosystem users on
   the personal and institutional level would be beneficial to the
   stability of coupled socioeconomic-ecological systems.},

Title = {From typhoons to traders: the role of patron-client relations in
   mediating fishery responses to natural disasters},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The majority of the world's fishers, fishworkers and their dependents
   live in coastal tropical areas that are, and will be, highly exposed to
   human-induced climate change. Projections indicate such change could
   result in coastal populations being more frequently and acutely impacted
   by natural disasters. Increasing aid interventions is a likely knock-on
   effect of such scenarios. How these external natural and social
   disturbances interact and affect local fisheries and small-scale
   producers is in part determined by the internal dynamics of the
   social-ecological system (SES). Economic vulnerability often
   characterizes communities in these settings and influences the means
   with which they navigate changes. The patron-client system is prolific
   in many rural economies and small-scale fisheries. It forms a central
   element in the organization of market interactions and often provides
   much needed finance for low-income households in place of formal
   options. How such injection of capital promotes individuals' ability to
   buffer income fluctuations at the expense of long-term sustainability of
   the broader fishery system is still an area in need of examination. This
   paper contributes to shed light on this issue by using a case study
   approach to trace the historical development of the fishery system in
   the Iloilo Province (Philippines) in relation to a major natural
   disaster-super-typhoon Haiyan, known locally as Yolanda-and the
   subsequent aid intervention that followed. The aim is to assess how the
   patron-client system filtered these two related disturbances and to
   highlight the resulting tensions between short-term individual
   resilience and longer-term SES sustainability.},

Abstract = {The benefits provided by a healthy ocean are receiving increasing
   attention in policy and management spheres. A fundamental challenge with
   assessing ocean health and ecosystem services is that we lack a
   scientific framework for expressing ecosystem conditions quantitatively
   in relation to management goals. Here we outline and operationalize a
   conceptual framework for identifying meaningful reference points and
   quantifying the current ecosystem state relative to them. The framework
   requires clear articulation of management goals and is built on a review
   of current scientific understanding and assessment of data availability.
   It develops a structured approach for choosing among three classes of
   reference points, including: (1) functional relationships that establish
   the ocean state that can be produced and sustained under different
   environmental conditions, (2) time series approaches that compare
   current to previous capacities to obtain a particular ocean state in a
   specific location, and (3) spatial reference points that compare current
   capacities to achieve a desired ocean state across regional (or, if
   necessary, global) scales. We illustrate this general framework through
   the lens of ocean health defined in terms of a coupled social-ecological
   system, with examples from fisheries, marine livelihoods, and water
   quality in the USA. Assessment of ocean health and ecosystem services
   can be significantly influenced by the choice of indicators used to
   track changes in a management goal, the type of reference point
   selected, and how one measures the distance of the current state from
   the reference point. This framework provides flexible, standardized
   methods for evaluating ocean health and ecosystem services that can
   advance important components of ecosystem-based management, including
   marine spatial planning, ecosystem service valuation, and integrated
   ecosystem assessments.},

Abstract = {Spawning aggregations are critical for the resilience of some coral reef
   fish populations and for the sustainability of many coastal fisheries.
   However, overexploitation of these aggregations is leading to a rapid
   decline of fish stocks. The fish aggregation site (FAS) associated with
   the San Felipe Keys National Park (in southwestern Cuba) is of great
   importance for the conservation of northern Caribbean snapper. An
   assessment of the pressure which fishing is placing on these
   populations, however, has not to date been conducted. To characterize
   the fishing use of San Felipe Keys FAS, data pertaining to five snapper
   species were evaluated in 2014. Samples consisted of 3879 individuals
   collected from 80 catch samples from commercial and sport fishing
   modalities. Catch assessment was performed using indicators based on
   length-frequency data (minimum legal size, length at first maturity,
   optimal length and average size of catch) and on fisheries effort data
   (seasonal and spatial yield by different modalities). To identify
   whether individuals were caught before or after spawning, the stage of
   gonads was analyzed. Individuals with sizes below the maturity length
   and with mature gonads before spawning prevailed in the five species,
   with Luyanus analis and L. cyanopterus being the most affected. The
   government commercial fishing fleet had the highest volume of catches
   and the largest impact. The indicators suggest that the current use of
   this FAS may impede the effective preservation of reproductive capacity
   of the population. Therefore, management and conservation initiatives of
   this FAS are urgently needed to maintain the sustain ability and
   resilience of the coralline social-ecological system.},

Title = {Space and time matter in social-ecological vulnerability assessments},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {213-221},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Fostering sustainable local social ecological interactions playing out
   against a backdrop of larger-scale dynamics are ubiquitous challenges to
   natural resource management and biodiversity conservation.
   Social-ecological vulnerability assessments are highly relevant for
   place-based management and can help target and prioritize management
   actions. However, an understanding of how linked social-ecological
   vulnerabilities respond to external drivers is still lacking. This paper
   presents an approach that integrates the spatial and temporal dimensions
   into social-ecological vulnerability assessments, where social and
   ecological vulnerabilities are linked by a feedback loop. The approach
   is applied to the Moorea coral reef social-ecological system, which has
   been significantly influenced by major environmental and social drivers
   over the last decade. Temporal changes in linked social-ecological
   vulnerabilities are mapped before and after exposure to the multiple
   drivers. Nearly 23\% of households and 13\% of the reef area show low
   and decreasing vulnerability despite exposure. However, high and
   increasing levels of vulnerability were detected in 6\% of households
   and associated reefs after exposure to the drivers, providing early
   warnings of potentially unsustainable situations. Importantly, changes
   in ecological vulnerability did not propagate linearly to changes in
   social vulnerability. Similarly, hot spots of social vulnerability were
   not necessarily associated with hot spots of ecological vulnerability,
   highlighting the need to specifically adapt management interventions to
   local social-ecological settings. Mapping social-ecological dependencies
   in space and time provides communities and decision-makers with the
   information required to identify and prioritize management interventions
   while accounting for the effects of large-scale or external drivers.},

Abstract = {We investigated the relative roles of natural factors and shoreline
   harvest leading to recent declines of the black leather chiton
   (Katharina tunicata) on the outer Kenai Peninsula, Alaska (USA). This
   intertidal mollusk is a strongly interacting grazer and a culturally
   important subsistence fishery for Sugpiaq (Chugach Alutiiq) natives. We
   took multiple approaches to determine causes of decline. Field surveys
   examined the significant predictors of Katharina density and biomass
   across 11 sites varying in harvest pressure, and an integrated analysis
   of archaeological faunal remains, historical records, traditional
   ecological knowledge, and contemporary subsistence invertebrate landings
   examined changes in subsistence practices through time. Strong evidence
   suggests that current spatial variation in Katharina density and biomass
   is driven by both human exploitation and sea otter (Enhydra lutris)
   predation. Traditional knowledge, calibrated by subsistence harvest
   data, further revealed that several benthic marine invertebrates (sea
   urchin, crab, clams, and cockles) have declined serially beginning in
   the 1960s, with reduced densities and sizes of Katharina being the most
   recent. The timing of these declines was coincident with changes in
   human behavior (from semi-nomadic to increasingly permanent settlement
   patterns, improved extractive technologies, regional commercial
   crustacean exploitation, the erosion of culturally based season and size
   restrictions) and with the reestablishment of sea otters. We propose
   that a spatial concentration in shoreline collection pressure through
   time, increased harvest efficiency, and the serial depletion of
   alternative marine invertebrate prey have led to intensified per capita
   predator impacts on Katharina and thus its recent localized decline.},

Title = {Quantitative pathways for Northeast Atlantic fisheries based on climate,

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {320},
Pages = {273-291},
Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {Here we present quantitative projections of potential futures for
   ecosystems in the North Atlantic basin generated from coupling a climate
   change-driven biophysical model (representing ecosystem and fish
   populations under climate change) and a scenario-driven
   ecological-economic model (representing fleets and industries under
   economic globalization). Four contrasting scenarios (Baseline, Fortress,
   Global Commons, Free Trade) were defined from the perspective of
   alternative regional management and governance of the oceanic basin,
   providing pathways for the future of ecosystems in the Northeast
   Atlantic basin by 2040. Results indicate that in the time frame
   considered: (I) the effects of governance and trade decisions are more
   significant in determining outcomes than the effects of climate change
   alone, (2) climate change is likely to result in a poleward latitudinal
   shift of species ranges and thus resources, with implications for
   exploitation patterns, (3) the level of fisheries regulation is the most
   important factor in determining the long term evolution of the fisheries
   system, (4) coupling climate change and governance impacts demonstrates
   the complex interaction between different components of this
   social-ecological system, (5) an important driver of change for the
   future of the North Atlantic and the European fishing fleets appears to
   be the interplay between wild fisheries and aquaculture development, and
   finally (6) scenarios demonstrate that the viability and profit of
   fisheries industries is highly volatile. This study highlights the need
   to explore basin-scale policy that combines medium to long-term
   environmental and socio-economic considerations, and the importance of
   defining alternative sustainable pathways. (C) 2015 Published by

   constitutes a good fit has been limited. We used a novel modeling
   approach and data from case studies of fishery and forest conservation
   to empirically test presumed relationships between conservation outcomes
   and certain patterns of alignment of social-ecological interdependences.
   Our approach made it possible to analyze conservation outcome on a
   systems level while also providing information on how individual actors
   are positioned in the complex web of social-ecological
   interdependencies. We found that when actors who shared resources were
   also socially linked, conservation at the level of the whole
   social-ecological system was positively affected. When the scales at
   which individual actors used resources and the scale at which ecological
   resources were interconnected to other ecological resources were aligned
   through tightened feedback loops, conservation outcome was better than
   when they were not aligned. The analysis of individual actors' positions
   in the web of social-ecological interdependencies was helpful in
   understanding why a system has a certain level of social-ecological fit.
   Results of analysis of positions showed that different actors
   contributed in very different ways to achieve a certain fit and revealed
   some underlying difference between the actors, for example in terms of
   actors' varying rights to access and use different ecological resources.},

Abstract = {Management of salmonids at local and regional levels in the Baltic, Sea
   is best analyzed by viewing the Baltic region as a complex
   social-ecological system. The ecosystem approach, now in an
   implementation phase in the Baltic Sea region, provides a framework for
   understanding interdependencies between resources, ecosystems and
   society, and examining management trade-offs. This study focuses on
   application of the ecosystem approach to management of two salmonids:
   the Atlantic salmon Salmo salar fishery in the Baltic Sea region and the
   brown trout S. trutta recreational fishery in Stockholm archipelago,
   Sweden. These cases provide illustrative examples of some current
   trend!; and key challenges for sustainable salmonidae management. The
   Baltic Sea has low biodiversity and Atlantic salmon is one of the few
   commercially or recreationally important fish species. In this region,
   fish resources and the ecosystems they depend on are shared by nine
   coastal nations. The different salmon populations spawn in their native
   rivers but mix in offshore areas where they are harvested by national
   fishing fleets. In the Baltic, a number of factors have impacted wild
   salmon populations. Hydropower development in the Baltic coastal states
   has led to declines in wild salmon populations and, to compensate,
   annual stocked fish releases. In attractive coastal areas such as the
   Stockholm archipelago in Sweden, increased recreational fishing has led
   to a shift in user patterns from small-scale commercial fisheries by
   islanders towards a heterogeneous group of visiting recreational
   fishers. Efforts to reorganize fisheries management institutions in the
   Baltic Sea region indicate the need to consider the full range of user
   groups, develop coherent multilevel management institutions, and achieve
   a better understanding of the role of diverse fish populations in the
   ecosystem.},

Title = {A social-ecological systems perspective on dried fish value chains},
Journal = {CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {Small-scale fisheries (SSF) support over 90\% of the 120 million people
   engaged in fisheries globally. Dried fish is an important sub-sector of
   SSF, which is characterized by declining social, economic, political
   conditions of people involved in its production, and the ecosystems they
   depend on. Dried fish accounts for 12\% of the total fish consumption
   globally but can increase up to 36\% in low-income countries. About half
   of the people involved in dried fish production and marketing are women.
   The approach taken to analyse dried fish sector has so far followed a
   narrow subset of commodity chain approaches with a focus on financial
   value, transmitted in a linear `vertical' fashion across value chain
   actors. Existing value chain approach fails to factor the non-capital
   re-lationships of dried fish that are contingent upon specific
   histories, ecologies, peoples, places, and the practices. The narrow
   neoclassical economic perspective of dried fish value chain (DFVC) also
   impedes appropriate re-sponses to their unique attributes pertaining to
   social, ecological, institutional interactions across multiple scales.
   Failure to consider social-ecological system (SES) attributes, its
   connections and relationships with dried fish value chain not only
   undermine social wellbeing of upstream actors but also perpetuates
   social-environmental inequity and injustice. The paper offers a novel
   SES-oriented DFVC perspective that focuses on social well-being of
   fishers and dried fish workers. The reconceptualisation of structure,
   conduct and performance of DFVC is done by conducting an
   interdisciplinary analysis of peer-reviewed literature from SES, value
   chain and social wellbeing.},

Abstract = {While the benefits humans gain from ecosystem functions and processes
   are critical in natural resource-dependent societies with persistent
   poverty, ecosystem services as a pathway out of poverty remain an
   elusive goal, contingent on the ecosystem and mediated by social
   processes. Here, we investigate three emerging dimensions of the
   ecosystem service-poverty relationship: economic contribution of
   provisioning ecosystem services to the household livelihood mix,
   social-ecological systems producing different bundles of ecosystem
   services and material wealth versus reported life satisfaction. We
   analyse these relationships in Bangladesh, using data from a bespoke
   1586-household survey, stratified by seven social-ecological systems in
   the delta coastal region. We create poverty lines to ensure
   comparability with traditional poverty measures that overlook
   environmental factors and subjective measurements of well-being. We find
   that any contribution of ecosystem service-based income to the
   livelihood mix decreases the likelihood of the incidence of poverty, and
   of individuals reporting dissatisfaction. We find no relationship
   between the incidence of material poverty and the specific
   social-ecological systems, from agriculture to fishery-dominated
   systems. However, the probability of the household head being
   dissatisfied was significantly associated with social-ecological system.
   Individuals living in areas dominated by export-oriented shrimp
   aquaculture reported lower levels of life satisfaction as an element of
   their perceived well-being. These results highlight the need for social
   policy on poverty that accounts for the diversity of outcomes across
   social-ecological systems, including subjective as well as material
   dimensions of well-being. National poverty reduction that degrades
   ecosystem services can have negative implications for the subjective
   well-being of local populations.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {Social resilience is an essential aspect of sustainability in
   environmental management, especially in poor resource-dependent
   communities. To better understand the dynamics of social resilience, we
   have conducted a primarily qualitative study of communities dependent on
   hilsa fishing in two coastal villages in southern Bangladesh. This study
   applies concepts of social-ecological system (SES), social resilience
   and co-management in outlining our qualitative data and framing its
   interpretation. Our findings show that while the establishment of hilsa
   sanctuary areas has enhanced the previously low ecological
   sustainability of local small-scale fishing, the management of this
   program has challenged the social resilience of hilsa fishers by
   creating new inequalities in the distribution of power and privilege, in
   terms of the ways in which seasonal fishing bans are enforced and
   compensation for income loss during the ban periods is distributed.
   Based on our findings, we suggest specific measures for strengthening
   social resilience at the local level, including building community
   networks, developing community infrastructures, updating existing rules
   and regulations, providing alternative means of generating income for
   fishers during the crisis periods (e.g. natural disasters and fishing
   ban periods) and more active sharing of responsibility between
   stakeholders and government for management of the hilsa fishery. These
   findings are also applicable to understanding the issues beyond rules
   and regulations that co-management arrangements need to address in order
   to be successful and to enhancing the function of co-management
   arrangements in improving social resilience within resource-dependent
   communities.},

Title = {Biological Diversity and Resilience: Lessons from the Recovery of
   Cichlid Species in Lake Victoria},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {A fundamental feature of the Anthropocene is the inexorable erosion of
   the self-repairing capacity or adaptive renewal of natural systems
   because of natural perturbation, exploitation, or management failure.
   The concept of resilience offers a systematic framework for
   understanding the dynamics and variables that govern response dynamics
   of ecosystems. Resilience of haplochromine cichlids is assessed using
   limnological and biodiversity changes in Lake Victoria, the world's
   second largest freshwater lake, over the last five decades. The review
   explores the resurgence of the haplochromine cichlids using Holling's
   adaptive renewal cycle and attempts to illustrate how resilience-based
   management approaches might learn from an inadvertent management
   experiment. The introduction in the 1980s of the Nile perch (Lates
   niloticus), a fecund and voracious predator of the endemic phytoplankton
   feeding haplochromine cichlids, anthropogenic eutrophication, and deep
   water hypoxia have combined in a synergistic way to increase the
   vulnerability of the lake ecosystem to perturbations that were hitherto
   absorbed. However, the upsurge in commercial Nile perch fishing appears
   to be enabling the resurgence of the haplochromine cichlids. The
   resurgence of haplochromine cichlids is characterized by phenotypic
   plasticity, ecological and life history traits and demonstrates the
   critical role of response diversity in the maintenance of systems
   resilience. Resilience of the haplochromine cichlids resides in the
   requisite functional response diversity and habitat diversity that
   provide the resources for renewal and regeneration. This paper concludes
   that management of Nile perch fisheries and control of nutrient loading
   into Lake Victoria could halt or reverse eutrophication, hence offer the
   best promise for a diverse, productive, and resilient social-ecological
   system.},

Year = {2009},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Key elements of the rapidly expanding field of ecosystem-based
   management include: (a) understanding connections among social and
   ecological systems and (b) developing analytical approaches to inform
   the necessary trade-offs among ecosystem services and human activities
   in coastal and marine areas. To address these needs, we investigate the
   impacts of multiple economic sectors on the marine ecosystem and
   dependent human community in the Gulf of California with an
   ecological-economic model. We focus on the spotted rose snapper
   (Lutjanus guttatus), an economically important species targeted
   concurrently by the nearshore artisanal fleet, the sportfishing fleet,
   and by the industrial shrimp fleet as bycatch. Economic returns to the
   local community are driven by the artisanal fishery catch and the number
   of tourists who engage in the sportsfishery, and these variables are in
   turn impacted by fish abundance. We find that the coexistence of the two
   sectors (and production of both seafood and tourism services) creates
   stability in key elements of the coupled systems. When the coupled
   systems are perturbed by changes in exploitation and climate
   variability, the artisanal fishery responds more rapidly and to a

   Our results suggest that vital components of coupled systems may well
   respond differently to climate variability or other perturbations, and
   that management strategies should be developed with this in mind. Models
   like ours can facilitate the development and testing of hypotheses about
   the form and strength of interactions between ecosystems, services, and

Title = {Tracing environmental and livelihood dynamics in a tropical coastal
   lagoon through the lens of multiple adaptive cycles},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {Understanding the long-term dynamics of social-ecological systems is
   critical to better inform sustainable management. Since Holling's
   adaptive cycle heuristic, published in 2001, substantial progress has
   been made to explore historical changes in agricultural, pastoral, and
   forest systems. However, the application of this heuristic in coastal
   fishery systems has been relatively rare. Using the Tam Giang Lagoon in
   Vietnam as an example of a rapidly changing environment, we explore the
   historical behavior of this tropical coastal social-ecological system
   (SES), associated livelihood pathways, and possible challenges for
   future livelihood adaptations through the lens of the adaptive cycle
   metaphor. Our analysis demonstrates that the present lagoon SES
   condition is the result of a series of historical events and
   reorganization attempts through two complete adaptive cycles. The
   lagoon's future vulnerability is tied to the intensification of human
   uses, prolonged ecological degradation, and intensifying climatic
   hazards. We show how the evolution of the lagoon SES resulted in
   divergent livelihood pathways that bring benefits to some users but also
   cause persistent constraints and sometimes irreversible losses to other
   users in shared common pool resources. A one-size-fits-all fishery
   management approach is therefore ill-suited for improving diverse
   livelihoods. We recommend that fishery policies take seriously the
   heterogeneity in livelihood pathways for sustainable lagoon management.
   We end by reflecting on the usefulness of the adaptive cycle heuristic
   in systematically exploring historical dynamics and identifying
   underlying drivers and feedbacks between the social and ecological
   components of complex fishery systems.},

Title = {Fair trade fish: consumer support for broader seafood sustainability},
Journal = {FISH AND FISHERIES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Pages = {825-838},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Sustainable seafood initiatives began with efforts to promote and
   certify seafood sourced from well-managed stocks caught with a reduced
   impact on the marine environment. More recently, social equity in
   fisheries has been the subject of increased concern with suggestions
   that seafood cannot be certified as sustainable if its production
   results in social harm, such as unfair wages or the use of forced or
   child labour. Together with local seafood, which has been promoted as an
   eco-friendly and socially conscious alternative to globally sourced
   seafood, these initiatives signal a growing interest in fisheries as a
   social-ecological system. However, this increasingly complex landscape
   of environmental sustainability and social justice may be difficult for
   the public and seafood consumers to navigate. Here, we investigate
   consumer understanding of and responsiveness to a range of seafood
   sustainability initiatives by testing preferences and willingness to pay
   (WTP) for seafood across the three types of sustainability: ecological
   sustainability, local origin and social sustainability. More than half
   of respondents demonstrated good understandings of both ecological
   sustainability and social sustainability with respect to seafood, and
   respondents were willing to pay more for all three types of
   sustainability. However, WTP for social sustainability benefits was the
   lowest, and consumers perceived a high degree of overlap of these
   benefits with those from locally sourced seafood. These results indicate
   that seafood certification taking a system-wide approach has potential
   to succeed, but that it will need to emerge in concert with the
   increased public education about social problems associated with
   globalized fisheries.},

Title = {Institutional designs of customary fisheries management arrangements in
   Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Mexico},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {There are considerable efforts by governments, non-governmental
   organizations (NGOs), and academia to integrate marine conservation
   initiatives and customary practices, such as taboos that limit resource
   use. However, these efforts are often pursued without a fundamental
   understanding of customary institutions. This paper examines the
   operational rules in use and the presence of institutional design
   principles in long-enduring and dynamic customary fisheries management
   institutions in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and Mexico. Rather than a
   ``blue print{''} for devising long-enduring institutions, this study
   relies on the design principles as a starting point to organize an
   inquiry into the institutional diversity found in customary governance
   regimes. Three important trends emerged from this comparative analysis:
   (1) despite it being notoriously difficult to define boundaries around
   marine resources, almost 3/4 of the cases in this study had clearly
   defined boundaries and membership; (2) all of the customary institutions
   were able to make and change rules, indicating a critical degree of
   flexibility and autonomy that may be necessary for adaptive management;
   (3) the customary institutions examined generally lacked key
   interactions with organizations operating at larger scales, suggesting
   that they may lack the institutional embeddedness required to confront
   some common pool resources (CPR) challenges from the broader
   socioeconomic, institutional and political settings in which they are
   embedded. Future research will be necessary to better understand how
   specific institutional designs are related to social and ecological
   outcomes in commons property institutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The Columbia River Basin is a complex social-ecological system, spanning
   political, legal, socio-economic, geographic, and biophysical
   boundaries. Outreach to others in social networks develops fundamental
   communications needed for sustainable collaborations in adaptive
   management. However, operationalizing and comparing measures of social
   processes and outcome success in biophysical indicators remains
   challenging for resource managers. Using survey-based research, we
   examined the interactions for water resource governance of five Columbia
   River reservoir basins in the northwestern US and Canada: Lakes Chelan,
   Roosevelt, Pend Oreille, Koocanusa, and clq'etkw (Flathead). Respondents
   included: water resource professionals working for Tribes/First Nations,
   federal, state, or provincial departments in water quality and/or
   fisheries, and people who engage in the networks on behalf of area
   businesses, government offices, public services, non-profit
   organizations, and other entities. Perceived social process metrics in
   these governance networks included the levels of collaboration and
   inclusiveness, common goals, common strategies, identifying issues,
   implementing action, and the adequacy of available scientific data. We
   evaluated social measures relative to participant-reported changes in
   physical lake health indicators. Qualitative data-enhanced understanding
   of basin-specific differences. Correlations of social by ecological
   measures varied widely between basins. Even moderate to strong
   functionality parameters did not scale well from individual to
   cross-basin levels, as many correlations vanished with data aggregated.
   However, data analysis at the basin scale revealed important variability
   across the region in scope and governance functionality. Process
   indicators such as identifying issues and implementing action yielded
   stronger relationships for 10-year horizons than for 2 years, reflecting
   the lag-time in resource action.},

Title = {Social-ecological vulnerability to climate change in small-scale
   fisheries managed under spatial property rights systems},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {121},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Small-scale fisheries (SSFs), which provide an important source of
   livelihood for many coastal communities, are at risk from climate
   change. Benthic organisms are likely to be particularly affected by the
   impacts of climate change due to their low spatial mobility, which
   limits their capacity for adaptation. Therefore, SSFs that target
   sedentary resources ({''}S-fisheries{''}) will potentially be among the
   most impacted types of fishery. The pathways of such impacts can be
   studied in an integrated approach by means of social-ecological
   vulnerability assessment. The stalked barnacle (Pollicipes pollicipes)
   fishery, one of the most important S-fisheries in Galicia (NW Spain),
   represents a complex social-ecological system rooted within the culture
   of the region. Along Galician coast, this benthic resource is co-managed
   by the territorial use rights in fisheries (TURFs) scheme. The
   vulnerability assessment involves ranking TURF systems according to the
   exposure of the resource to climate hazards, the sensitivity of
   dependent people and the capacity of the system to adapt to the impacts.
   After analyzing 26 stalked barnacle TURFs (79\% of all Galician TURFs),
   we identified the most vulnerable zones (Muxia and O Pindo), as
   indicated by high levels of ecological vulnerability and social
   sensitivity and low adaptive capacity. We discuss different ways of
   increasing the adaptive capacity of TURFs based on local knowledge and
   literature reviews. Vulnerability assessment represents a powerful tool
   that can be used to help policy-makers develop adaptation strategies
   needed at different time scales, ultimately contributing towards better
   informed, sustainable and efficient fisheries management.},

Title = {Community science: A typology and its implications for governance of
   social-ecological systems},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {106},
Pages = {77-86},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {There is an increasing recognition globally of the role to be played by
   community science-scientific research and monitoring driven and
   controlled by local communities, and characterized by place-based
   knowledge, social learning, collective action and empowerment. In
   particular, community science can support social-ecological system
   transformation, and help in achieving better `fit' between ecological
   systems and governance, at local and higher levels of decision making.
   This paper draws on three examples of communities as central actors in
   the process of knowledge co-production to present a typology of
   community science, and to deduce a set of key principles/conditions for
   success. The typology involves three social learning models in which the
   community acquires scientific knowledge by (1) engaging with external
   bodies, (2) drawing on internal volunteer scientific expertise, and/or
   (3) hiring (or contracting) in-house professional scientific expertise.
   All of these models share the key characteristic that the local
   community decides with whom they wish to engage, and in each case,
   social learning is fundamental. Some conditions that facilitate
   community science include: community-driven and community-control;
   flexibility across leadership models; connection to place and collective
   values; empowerment, agency and collective action; credible trust; local
   knowledge; and links to governance. Community science is not a panacea
   for effecting change at the local level, and there is need for critical
   assessment of how it can help to fill governance gaps. Nevertheless, a
   considerable body of experience globally illustrates how local
   communities are drawing effectively on community science for better
   conservation and livelihood outcomes, in a manner compatible with
   broader trends toward ecosystem-based management and local stewardship.},

Title = {Participatory planning of a community-based payments for ecosystem
   services initiative in Madagascar's mangroves},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {175},
Pages = {43-52},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Although the dynamics of coastal resources are largely determined by the
   impacts of human users, spatially-explicit social data are rarely
   systematically integrated into coastal management planning in data-poor
   developing states. In order to plan a community-based mangrove payments
   for ecosystem services initiative in southwest Madagascar, we used two
   participatory approaches; public participation geographic information
   systems and concept modelling workshops - with 10 coastal communities to
   investigate the dynamics and spatial distribution of the mangrove
   resources they use. In each village we conducted participatory mapping
   of land and resource use with different livelihood groups using printed
   satellite images, and concept modelling workshops to develop concept
   models of the mangrove social-ecological system (including the
   identification of threats and underlying drivers, and proposals for
   targeted management strategies). Each community then proposed mangrove
   zoning consisting of strict conservation zones, sustainable use zones
   and restoration zones. Following validation and ground-truthing, the
   proposed zones and management strategies formed the basis of the zoning
   and management plan for the mangrove. Participatory approaches proved a
   simple and reliable way to gather spatial data and better understand the
   relationships between the mangrove and those who use it. Moreover,
   participation stimulated mangrove users to consider resource trends, the
   impacts of their activities, and required management actions, promoting
   a collective `buy-in' for the project. Since participation extended
   beyond research to the development of management zones, rules and
   strategies, we believe that community ownership of the project has been
   strengthened and the chances of successfully conserving the mangrove
   improved.},

Title = {Information network topologies for enhanced local adaptive management},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {175-193},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We examined the principal effects of different information network
   topologies for local adaptive management of natural resources. We used
   computerized agents with adaptive decision algorithms with the following
   three fundamental constraints: (1) Complete understanding of the
   processes maintaining the natural resource can never be achieved, (2)
   agents can only learn by experimentation and information sharing, and
   (3) memory is limited. The agents were given the task to manage a system
   that had two states: one that provided high utility returns (desired)
   and one that provided low returns (undesired). In addition, the
   threshold between the states was close to the optimal return of the
   desired state. We found that networks of low to moderate link densities
   significantly increased the resilience of the utility returns. Networks
   of high link densities contributed to highly synchronized behavior among
   the agents, which caused occasional large-scale ecological crises
   between periods of stable and high utility returns. A constructed
   network involving a small set of experimenting agents was capable of
   combining high utility returns with high resilience, conforming to
   theories underlying the concept of adaptive comanagement. We conclude
   that (1) the ability to manage for resilience (i.e., to stay clear of
   the threshold leading to the undesired state as well as the ability to
   re-enter the desired state following a collapse) resides in the network
   structure and (2) in a coupled social-ecological system, the system-wide
   state transition occurs not because the ecological system flips into the
   undesired state, but because managers lose their capacity to reorganize
   back to the desired state.},

Title = {Modeling fine scale urchin and kelp dynamics: Implications for
   management of the Maine sea urchin fishery},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {141},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {107-117},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Maine sea urchin fishery is a classic boom-bust fishery in which
   efforts to sustain the resource failed despite the creation of a
   co-management system. We report on ethnographic work undertaken to
   assist in the development of a fine scale model of the natural system of
   this fishery. The development of the natural system model required
   understanding the key linkages between the biology and ecology of the
   sea urchin and the behavior of fishermen. Information was gathered from
   the primary scientific literature and from interviews with sea urchin
   industry members and scientists. Urchin-kelp interactions at a very fine
   scale create patchy, almost sedentary aggregations of urchins.
   Settlement of larval urchins appears to be ubiquitous; however, after
   settlement patches of urchins operate as nearly independent demographic
   units. In the short term - months to several years - the abundance of
   urchins in any patch and the spatial dynamics within these patches are
   determined largely by the actions of fishermen. Consequently, the
   resource can be characterized as a dynamic fitness landscape in which
   the spatial structure of urchin patches is the principal determinant of
   fishermen's harvesting strategies and fishermen's activities are the
   principal determinant of the spatial structure of urchin patches. While
   doing the interviews for the natural system model, we developed a fine
   scale alternative to the usual theoretical explanation of overfishing.
   The scale of management in the fishery occurs at a much broader scale
   than the demographically relevant scale of urchin patches. This results
   in a mismatch of ecological and management scales that leave each patch
   in the fishery in an open access state, resulting in a very fine scale
   form of serial overfishing that removes, piece-by-piece, discrete, local
   aggregations of sea urchins. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Understanding Social-Ecological Challenges of a Small-Scale Hilsa
   (<i>Tenualosa ilisha</i>) Fishery in Bangladesh},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {16},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Small-scale fisheries (SSFs) have been playing a crucial role in meeting
   the basic needs of millions of people around the world. Despite this,
   the sustainability of global fisheries is a growing concern, and the
   factors enabling or constraining the sustainable management of
   small-scale fisheries remain poorly understood. Hilsa shad (Tenualosa
   ilisha) is the single most valuable species harvested in Bangladesh
   waters, serves nutrition, income, and employment to the large
   population. This study analyzed the state and challenges of hilsa
   fishery in the Gangetic River systems (Padma and Meghna Rivers) by using
   two frameworks, namely the social-ecological systems (SES) and
   drivers-pressure-state-impact-responses (DPSIR) frameworks. Primary data
   for this analysis were collected by in-depth interviews (n = 130) and
   focus group discussions (n = 8) with various stakeholders in the hilsa
   fisheries. The perspectives explored here have been both critical and
   constructive, including the identification of problems and suggestions
   for improving the management of this particular social-ecological
   system. Hilsa fisheries, however, have come under severe threat since
   2003 because of population growth, overfishing, pollution, climate
   change, the disruption of migration routes due to siltation, etc. All
   these have caused reduced catches and less stable incomes for fishers.
   This, in turn, has led to poverty, malnutrition, social tensions,
   stakeholder conflicts, and debt cycles amongst more impoverished fishing
   communities. These problems have been compounded by improved fishing
   technology amongst larger-scale ventures, the use of illegal fishing
   gears, and the non-compliance of government fishery management programs.
   Recommendations include the promotion of community-supported fisheries,
   the enhancement of stakeholder's social resilience, the introduction of
   co-management approach, an increase in incentives and formal financial
   supports, and possible community-managed sustainable ecotourism
   including hilsa fishing-based tourism.},

   Archipelago, Sweden},

Abstract = {Property rights are important institutions for regulating the use of
   valuable natural resources from coastal ecosystems. In this case study,
   we identify and analyze property rights and user patterns related to
   small-scale coastal fisheries in the Stockholm Archipelago, Sweden. User
   patterns and user groups have changed significantly over the last
   century, as commercial fishing has been increasingly replaced by
   recreational activities. Interviews with local resource users and owners
   of water properties in two different areas, Moja and Orno parishes
   within the Stockholm Archipelago, revealed a very diverse pattern of
   property and user rights, with a large number of water and fishing
   rights owners. Recreational fisheries, including both sport and
   household fishing, seem to predominate in both areas, but ownership
   differs. In Moja, most waters are collectively owned, whereas in Orno,
   individual ownership predominates. Very few examples of local influence
   on fisheries management were found in either area, although the social
   structure for joint management does exist in Moja. Instead, larger-scale
   institutions at the regional, national, or international level regulate
   fisheries, often not addressing local conditions and fish populations.
   The ongoing shift in resource use has created a heterogeneous user
   group, and the limitations of centralized management authorities in
   dealing with the diversity in the coastal ecosystem have created
   mismatches within the social ecological system. Combined with a
   large-scale decline in coastal fish stocks, these mismatches challenge
   the existing local property rights arrangements as well as the more
   centralized regulatory management structure. A key issue for fisheries
   management is how to develop and stimulate appropriate distribution of
   management functions at different geographical scales and organizational
   levels. The complexity and diversity in archipelago fisheries call for
   multilevel arrangements and cross-scale coordination, and initiatives
   have been taken by both central governmental authorities and local user
   groups to collaborate concerning habitat restoration and protection of
   important spawning grounds.},

Title = {Can the Indonesian Collective Action Norm of Gotong-Royong Be
   Strengthened with Economic Incentives? Comparing the Implementation of
   an Aquaculture Irrigation Policy Program},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {462-480},
Abstract = {The Indonesian multi-level governmental program (PITAP) is a
   participatory pond irrigation management policy established by the
   Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries. It aims to catalyze the
   rehabilitation of irrigation canals to improve water access for
   small-scale aquaculture farmers. In PITAP, traditional aquaculture
   farmers are incentivized with government funding to create
   community-based co-management groups (POKLINA), to maintain the
   self-governance of their irrigation canals. The logic of PITAP is to
   encourage POKLINA farmers to rehabilitate their irrigation canals
   through subsidized labor payments that are coupled with strengthening
   the strong cultural norm of mutual assistance (i.e., collective action)
   within Indonesian society called Gotong-Royong. PITAP aims to revitalize
   Gotong-Royong through subsidized labor compensation with the hope that
   when the subsidy program is over, Gotong-Royong will be revitalized
   without external support. In this study, we compare and analyze four
   villages on Lombok, Indonesia, that participated in PITAP program in
   2020 and 2021. The study is supported with empirical data using various
   qualitative data collection methods, including interviews, participant
   observations, and the collection of policy documents. We further use the
   Social-Ecological System Framework (SESF) as a diagnostic tool to
   structure the data collection process and analysis. Findings indicate
   that different variables hinder and enable collective action in the four
   villages, leading to different PITAP program outcomes. The likely reason
   for this, suggested by our findings, is that each village has different
   social and ecological conditions that influence intrinsic motivation for
   collective action. PITAP program either crowds out intrinsic motivation
   under some conditions or crowds it in under others. This suggests the
   need to consider contextual adaptations in policy design and
   implementation to improve outcomes better.},

Title = {Gulf fisheries supported resilience in the decade following unparalleled
   oiling},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DwH) disaster challenged the integrity of
   the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) large-marine ecosystem at unprecedented scales,
   prompting concerns of devastating injury for GOM fisheries in the
   post-spill decade. Following the catastrophe, projected economic losses
   for regional commercial, recreational, and mariculture sectors for the
   decade after oiling were US\$3.7-8.7 billion overall, owing to the
   vulnerability of economically prized, primarily nearshore taxa that
   support fishing communities. State and federal fisheries data during
   2000-2017 indicated that GOM fishery sectors appeared to serve as
   remarkable anchors of resilience following the largest accidental marine
   oil spill in human history. Evidence of post-disaster impacts on
   fisheries economies was negligible. Rather, GOM commercial sales during
   2010-2017 were US\$0.8-1.5 billion above forecasts derived using
   pre-spill (2000-2009) trajectories, while pre- and post-spill
   recreational fishery trends did not differ appreciably. No post-spill
   shifts in target species or effort distribution across states were
   apparent to explain these findings. Unraveling the mechanisms for this
   unforeseen stability represents an important avenue for understanding
   the vulnerability or resilience of human-natural systems to future
   disturbances. Following DwH, the causes for fishery responses are likely
   multifaceted and complex (including exogenous economic forces that
   typically affect fisheries-dependent data), but appear partially
   explained by the relative ecological stability of coastal fishery
   assemblages despite widespread oiling, which has been corroborated by
   multiple fishery-independent surveys across the northern GOM.
   Additionally, we hypothesize that damage payments to fishermen led to
   acquisition or retooling of commercial fisheries infrastructure, and
   subsequent rises in harvest effort. Combined, these social-ecological
   dynamics likely aided recovery of stressed coastal GOM communities in
   the years after DwH, although increased fishing pressure in the
   post-spill era may have consequences for future GOM ecosystem structure,
   function, and resilience.},

Title = {Engaging with complexity in resilience practice},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In a complex and turbulent world, there is heightened interest in
   managing for resilience. However, resilience guides, particularly those
   used in the development field, often lack a theoretical grounding in
   complex adaptive systems. There is a demand for guidance on how to
   operationalize complexity in applications of resilience, such as
   resilience assessment and planning. This study synthesizes lessons from
   how twelve cases of social-ecological resilience practice are engaging
   with complexity. We assessed how each case engaged with complexity,
   according to a framework of six features of complex adaptive systems.
   The cases are situated in a diversity of contexts, that include rural
   villages in Tajikistan, a Swedish municipality, Australian catchment
   management authorities, a Canadian coastal fishery, and the Arctic
   council. Our results revealed two main ways of engaging with complexity:
   capturing and making sense of the complexity of a social-ecological
   system (system complexity) and embodying complexity into the
   participatory process (process complexity). Our comparison demonstrates
   that resilience practice provides a useful approach to address system
   complexity by, for example, conceptualizing social-ecological
   interactions, identifying interactions across scales, and assessing
   system dynamics. Strategies related to understanding the adaptive and
   emergent features of complex systems were less developed and widespread.
   The study also revealed a set of strategies to address process
   complexity, such as facilitating dialogue, building networks, and
   designing a flexible and iterative process, showing how complexity can
   be embedded into the resilience assessment process. The more
   participatory and embedded cases of resilience practice were stronger in
   these process-oriented strategies. The complexity framework we used and
   the identified practical strategies provide a theoretically-grounded
   resource for managers, decision-makers, and researchers on how to engage
   with complexity when applying resilience in a variety of contexts,
   including development and landscape management.},

Title = {``Like the plains people losing the buffalo{''}: perceptions of climate
   change impacts, fisheries management, and adaptation actions by
   Indigenous peoples in coastal British Columbia, Canada},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Rapidly developing and complex climate change impacts have profound
   implications for coastal communities, demanding adaptation actions for
   both social and ecological systems. Along the coast of British Columbia,
   Canada, Indigenous peoples developed a tightly coupled social-ecological
   system that was interrupted by the arrival of settler colonialism in the
   1800s. Although both climate change adaptation and the impacts of
   colonization have been well studied, little research has examined how
   these themes interact, and the conditions that may support or prevent
   people's ability to adapt to the social-ecological changes that emerge.
   Through a collaborative partnership with four First Nations and their
   umbrella organization for technical support, we examined people's
   perceptions of social and ecological aspects of adaptation to climate
   change. Using semistructured interviews (n = 50), four key strategies
   emerged as critical for climate change adaptation: (1) strengthening
   Indigenous governance autonomy and authority, (2) promoting knowledge
   sharing for adaptation practices within and among communities, (3)
   promoting adaptive comanagement among governance scales, and (4)
   developing learning platforms for climate impacts and adaptive
   strategies. Actions typically proposed by non-Indigenous government,
   including marine protected areas and ecosystem-based management were not
   prioritized. We found diverse attitudes toward climate change impacts,
   indicating that people's perceptions of adaptation strategies are
   strongly influenced by exposure to observable impacts, the
   social-ecological context in which they live, and perceptions of
   governance and self-determination. Our study suggests that supporting
   Indigenous peoples' ability to adapt to climate change will require
   transforming the current governance model into one that acknowledges
   Indigenous social, cultural, and food needs and how these relate to
   marine resources and territorial management rights.},

Title = {Uruguayan fisheries under an increasingly globalized scenario: Long-term
   landings and bioeconomic trends},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {190},
Pages = {53-60},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The systematic dwindling over time of many commercially important fish
   stocks in developed countries and the increasing demand of international
   markets provided a window of opportunity for fishery sector development
   in many developing countries. Science-based assessments of how market
   forces impact on fisheries trends are particularly limited in developing
   countries. This study assessed long-term trends (1960-2013) of the
   Uruguayan industrial fishery sector, including: (i) landings
   discriminated by species and resource type; (ii) variations in nominal
   effort and fleet capacity; (iii) bioeconomic patterns for most important
   species; and (iv) export and import volumes at the Uruguayan seafood
   market. Results indicate the sector underwent four phases that depict
   long-term patterns: development, expansion,
   stabilization-diversification and declining yields and market
   contraction. The development of the sector was mainly due to the
   Argentine hake fishery, which was characterized by a sustained increase
   in landings, nominal effort and fleet capacity during the initial
   decades, but showed a decreasing trend afterwards. In response, a
   fishery diversification policy based on more valuable target species but
   with lower trophic levels was developed. Uruguay adopted a seafood net
   exporter role since the very beginning, with exports increasing linearly
   through time. More recently, seafood imports, with more competitive
   prices than locally caught seafood, have been gaining ground in the
   domestic market, reaching a third of all seafood currently consumed.
   Nowadays, the Uruguayan fishery sector is facing a crisis that is
   clearly reflected in the decreasing yields of the main species targeted,
   exports dwindling and increasing seafood imports. These results
   highlight the pressing need of the industrial sector to shift its model
   of fisheries exploitation. This study also provides evidence of the need
   to consider additional bioeconomic analysis to fully understand the
   behavior of the fishery sector as a dynamic social-ecological system
   operating in a globalized seafood trade scenario. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Evaluating the Management of a Tropical Reservoir: Implications of
   Climate Change for Water Availability},
Journal = {PACIFIC SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {74},
Number = {2},
Pages = {115-135},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Most tropical islands have limited water supply due to the small size of
   their watersheds and aquifers, unique geology, and distribution of
   rainfall; each affecting the reliability of water resources for meeting
   agricultural needs. To improve water supply, reservoirs provide critical
   storage of surface water. However, climate-driven shifts in the
   distribution, intensity, and amount of rainfall will alter runoff that
   feeds reservoirs. Mass-balance modeling was used to evaluate the effects
   of various management constraints on water availability for the Wahiawa
   Reservoir (O'ahu, Hawai'i) as well as the impact of 20\% less dry season
   rainfall and stream flow to assess the effect of projected climate
   change on maintaining: (1) a minimum downstream flow; (2) a minimum
   agricultural supply; (3) a minimum and maximum reservoir level; and (4)
   a combination of minimum downstream flow and minimum agricultural
   supply. Under current climate conditions, maintaining a minimal
   downstream water release could be met with minimal consequences for
   agricultural supply and reservoir level. However, both agricultural
   supply and downstream flow had to be reduced during dry periods to keep
   the reservoir level above a minimum level. Maintaining a minimum
   downstream flow resulted in a 4.2\% reduction in mean agricultural
   supply and 2.2 \% reduction in mean reservoir elevation compared to
   baseline conditions. By contrast, a 20\% reduction in dry season water
   inputs resulted in a 17.8\% reduction in mean agricultural supply in the
   minimum downstream flow scenario compared to current rainfall
   conditions. Furthermore, the number of days the reservoir level dropped
   below the minimum needed for a fishery increased (range 1.15-25x) across
   scenarios compared to baseline. Successful management of surface water
   within a social-ecological system will be challenged by the increasing
   unpredictability of rainfall.},

Title = {Implementing Participatory Water Management: Recent Advances in Theory,
   Practice, and Evaluation},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Many current water planning and management problems are riddled with
   high levels of complexity, uncertainty, and conflict, so-called
   ``messes{''} or ``wicked problems.{''} The realization that there is a
   need to consider a wide variety of values, knowledge, and perspectives
   in a collaborative decision making process has led to a multitude of new
   methods and processes being proposed to aid water planning and
   management, which include participatory forms of modeling, planning, and
   decision aiding processes. However, despite extensive scientific
   discussions, scholars have largely been unable to provide satisfactory
   responses to two pivotal questions: (1) What are the benefits of using
   participatory approaches?; (2) How exactly should these approaches be
   implemented in complex social-ecological settings to realize these
   potential benefits? In the study of developing social-ecological system
   sustainability, the first two questions lead to a third one that extends
   beyond the one-time application of participatory approaches for water
   management: (3) How can participatory approaches be most appropriately
   used to encourage transition to more sustainable ecological, social, and
   political regimes in different cultural and spatial contexts? The answer
   to this question is equally open. This special feature on participatory
   water management attempts to propose responses to these three questions
   by outlining recent advances in theory, practice, and evaluation related
   to the implementation of participatory water management. The feature is
   largely based on an extensive range of case studies that have been
   implemented and analyzed by cross-disciplinary research teams in
   collaboration with practitioners, and in a number of cases in close
   cooperation with policy makers and other interested parties such as
   farmers, fishermen, environmentalists, and the wider public.},

Title = {Social-ecological traps link food systems to nutritional outcomes},
Journal = {GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Recognized as an emerging global crisis in the mid-1990s, the
   ``nutrition transition{''} is marked by a shift to Western diets,
   dominated by highly processed, sugar-sweetened, and high caloric foods.
   Occurring in parallel to these health transitions are dramatic shifts in
   the natural systems that underlie food availability and access.
   Traditionally, environmental degradation and ecosystem change, and
   processes of nutritional transition, though often collinear and
   potentially causally linked, have been addressed in isolation. Food
   systems represent an emblematic social-ecological system, as both
   cultivated and wild foods are directly reliant on natural ecosystems and
   their processes. While healthy ecosystems are a necessary precondition
   of food production, they are not themselves sufficient to ensure
   continued benefits from local food systems. Mediating between food
   production and nutritional security are myriad governance and market
   institutions that shape differential access to food resources. Moreover,
   globalization and urbanization may shift communities from non-market to
   market-based economies, with profound implications for local
   environments and food systems. Specifically, we argue that it is this
   feedback between coupled socioeconomic and natural dynamics within food
   systems that reinforces specific nutritional outcomes, and may result in
   a social-ecological trap. Here, we use the case of reef-based food
   systems globally, paying particular attention to the Pacific to showcase
   social-ecological traps present in global food systems, and to
   illustrate how such traps lead to the acceleration of the nutrition
   transition. Improving both nutritional and environmental outcomes of
   food systems requires understanding the underlying drivers of each, and
   how they interact and reinforce each other. Only in recognizing these
   interactions and coupled dynamics will economic, governance, and
   environmental policies be positioned to address these food system
   challenges in an integrated fashion.},

Title = {Limitations of the random response technique and a call to implement the
   ballot box method for estimating recreational angler compliance using
   surveys},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {208},
Pages = {34-41},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Accurate estimation of the levels of non-compliance to fishing
   regulations is crucial in ensuring that long term sustainability goals
   of fisheries are met. When requesting information regarding sensitive
   behaviour, such as an anglers non-compliance to regulations through
   direct questioning methods (DQM), their responses can be influenced by
   social desirability bias (SDB). Literature in human dimensions research
   on methods for controlling this bias is limited. There has been an
   emerging prevalence in the use of the random response technique (RRT),
   which is a method aimed at reducing SDB in questions regarding sensitive
   behaviour, although it has never been validated against observed data in
   an environmental resource use context. An alternative to the RRT, the
   use of a ballot box method (BBM) has been successfully implemented to
   reduce SDB in contingent valuation studies and is introduced in this
   paper as a method for reducing SDB in face-to-face survey responses
   regarding sensitive behaviour. The RRT, BBM and a baseline DQM were
   compared for accuracy in obtaining honest responses from non-compliant
   anglers in South Africas recreational marine based shore fishery (MBSF)
   who were covertly observed violating various regulations. A total of
   79.6\% of anglers who were interviewed using the BBM admitted to
   breaking the observed regulation. However, only 46.5\% and 38.5\% of the
   anglers who were interviewed using the DQM and RRT admitted to breaking
   the regulations. The length of the angler interview using the RRT was
   also significantly longer than the BBM and DQM. These results suggest
   that the BBM is the most accurate and practical method for reducing SDB
   in compliance surveys.},

Title = {Ancient clam gardens, traditional management portfolios, and the
   resilience of coupled human-ocean systems},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Indigenous communities have actively managed their environments for
   millennia using a diversity of resource use and conservation strategies.
   Clam gardens, ancient rock-walled intertidal beach terraces, represent
   one example of an early mariculture technology that may have been used
   to improve food security and confer resilience to coupled human-ocean
   systems. We surveyed a coastal landscape for evidence of past resource
   use and management to gain insight into ancient resource stewardship
   practices on the central coast of British Columbia, Canada. We found
   that clam gardens are embedded within a diverse portfolio of resource
   use and management strategies and were likely one component of a larger,
   complex resource management system. We compared clam diversity, density,
   recruitment, and biomass in three clam gardens and three unmodified
   nonwalled beaches. Evidence suggests that butter clams (Saxidomus
   gigantea) had 1.96 times the biomass and 2.44 times the density in clam
   gardens relative to unmodified beaches. This was due to a reduction in
   beach slope and thus an increase in the optimal tidal range where clams
   grow and survive best. The most pronounced differences in butter clam
   density between nonwalled beaches and clam gardens were found at high
   tidal elevations at the top of the beach. Finally, clam recruits (0.5-2
   mm in length) tended to be greater in clam gardens compared to nonwalled
   beaches and may be attributed to the addition of shell hash by ancient
   people, which remains on the landscape today. As part of a broader
   social-ecological system, clam garden sites were among several
   modifications made by humans that collectively may have conferred
   resilience to past communities by providing reliable and diverse access
   to food resources.},

Title = {The first nation-wide assessment identifies valuable blue-carbon
   seagrass habitat in Indonesia is in moderate condition},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {782},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Seagrasses help mitigate climate change by capturing and storing carbon
   for a very long time. Despite their significance, multiple threats are
   putting pressure on this valuable habitat. Seagrass conservation and
   restoration is essential to maintain the carbon sequestration service,
   along with the other ecosystem services (e.g., fisheries production).
   Information on the status of seagrass habitat is required to enable
   proactive management strategies. In this study, we assessed the
   ecological status of seagrass meadows in Indonesia, a globally
   significant hotspot of blue carbon habitat, using five resilience
   parameters: seagrass species richness, seagrass cover, macroalgal cover,
   epiphyte cover, and water transparency. We collected data on these
   parameters from 18 locations across Indonesia and developed the Seagrass
   Ecological Quality Index (SEQI, range 0-1) that summarises the
   parameters into a standard seagrass assessment. We recorded that
   Thalassia hemprichii and Enhalus acoroides were the most common species
   in the sampling locations. Seagrass cover was on average 39 +/- 3.6\%
   (mean +/- SE) which was lower than measured 3 years before (46\%).
   Macroalgal cover and epiphyte cover were relatively low with mean values
   10 +/- 1.8\% and 22 +/- 4.4\% respectively. Most locations had clear
   water. Our analysis showed that Indonesia's seagrass meadows are
   generally in moderate condition, indicated by the mean value of SEQI
   0.68 +/- 0.02. These findings provide a baseline for seagrass
   conservation and management. It enables setting up of specific goals for
   management action plans, at both the local, national and international
   level, and where appropriate, track the progress of management actions
   based on threat mitigation or restoration over time. The SEQI is a
   useful tool to summarise the condition of tropical seagrass meadows in
   Indonesia and could be applied across Southeast Asia or the Tropical
   Indo-Pacific bioregion. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Mangroves, fishers, and the struggle for adaptive comanagement: applying
   the social-ecological systems framework to a marine extractive reserve
   (RESEX) in Brazil},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Brazil has a network of marine extractive reserves (RESEX), a form of
   marine protected area (MPA) using comanagement. The RESEX program aims
   to bring traditionally marginalized populations with natural resource
   dependent livelihoods into national development processes by empowering
   them to participate in governance and steward biodiversity conservation.
   We apply the social-ecological systems framework (SESF) and collective
   action theory to diagnose challenges for comanagement in the
   Caete-Teperacu marine RESEX near Braganca, Brazil, a multiuse mangrove
   estuary supporting a small-scale crab fishery. We conducted key
   informant interviews and build on over 20 years of research in the
   region to provide an overarching analysis of the challenges facing
   comanagement. We describe the variables from the SESF in the case
   context and find that many social and ecological variables interact in
   clusters over time, and these clusters can be identified as themes,
   including (1) social and political momentum supporting the RESEX; (2)
   shifting perceptions of local residents and fishers; (3) patron-client
   relationships and social-ecological traps; (4) challenges with
   institutional fit; and (5) the interactions between harvesting closures,
   compensation, and dependence on local natural resources. Furthermore, we
   use collective action theory to help explain the role that each variable
   plays in either hindering or enabling successful governance. Our
   findings suggest that institutional resilience is needed to make RESEX
   adaptive to shifting social and political momenta. It could do this by
   providing more platforms for communication, deliberation, and knowledge
   exchange among the relevant actors. We believe our findings reflect
   broader challenges facing RESEX implementation throughout Brazil, and
   lessons can be learned for MPAs facing difficulties with the
   implementation of comanagement worldwide.},

Title = {Understanding the development of recreational fisheries with an industry
   competitiveness framework: Evaluation of a case study from China},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {143},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Recreational fishing is an important component of the global capture
   fishery, given its significant role in the economy, social culture, and
   ecology. Compared to the mature development found in industrialized
   countries, recreational fishing in developing countries or transitional
   economy is a new industry with abundant jobs and high revenues. China's
   recreational fishery industry has shown an upward trend since 2003. This
   paper built an evaluation framework from both static (present
   competitive strength) and dynamic (potential competitive strength)
   perspectives to evaluate recreational fishery competitiveness in 30
   Chinese provinces based on normal cloud model. The results showed the
   following: (1) The evaluation framework can effectively evaluate
   recreational fishery competitiveness. Meanwhile, there is significant
   randomness and fuzziness discrepancy between different indicators.
   `Industry' indicators had the lowest fuzziness and randomness. (2) The
   development of recreational fishery competitiveness in China is not
   strong and uneven, with more than two-thirds of the total provinces with
   the lowest competitiveness level. Regarding spatial distribution, the
   eastern coastal provinces had relatively strong competitiveness, whereas
   the western inland provinces were weak. (3) There was stability
   divergence of competitiveness results among different grades. In
   general, the competitiveness of provinces belonging to grades I and V
   was the most stable, while other provinces are relatively unstable with
   the characteristics of dynamic changes. (4) The main advantageous
   factors for recreational fishery competitiveness in most provinces were
   `service', whereas the main disadvantageous factor was `resources'. The
   abundance of fishery resources might not be a key factor resulting in
   regional recreational fishery competitiveness discrepancies. This study
   can provide a reference for decision-makers to formulate an assessment
   framework for recreational fishery industry and provide ideas for the
   formulation of recreational fishery planning at the national level.},

Title = {The Regime Shifts Database: a framework for analyzing regime shifts in
   social-ecological systems},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Regime shifts, i.e., large, persistent, and usually unexpected changes
   in ecosystems and social-ecological systems, can have major impacts on
   ecosystem services, and consequently, on human well-being. However, the
   vulnerability of different regions to various regime shifts is largely
   unknown because evidence for the existence of regime shifts in different
   ecosystems and parts of the world is scattered and highly uneven.
   Furthermore, research tends to focus on individual regime shifts rather
   than comparisons across regime shifts, limiting the potential for
   identifying common drivers that could reduce the risk of multiple regime
   shifts simultaneously. Here, we introduce the Regime Shifts Database, an
   open-access database that systematically synthesizes information on
   social-ecological regime shifts across a wide range of systems using a
   consistent, comparative framework, providing a wide-ranging information
   resource for environmental planning, assessment, research, and teaching
   initiatives. The database currently contains 28 generic types of regime
   shifts and > 300 specific case studies. Each entry provides a
   literature-based synthesis of the key drivers and feedbacks underlying
   the regime shift, as well as impacts on ecosystem services and human
   well-being, and possible management options. Across the 28 regime
   shifts, climate change and agriculture-related activities are the most
   prominent among a wide range of drivers. Biodiversity, fisheries, and
   aquatic ecosystems are particularly widely affected, as are key aspects
   of human well-being, including livelihoods, food and nutrition, and an
   array of cultural ecosystem services. We hope that the database will
   stimulate further research and teaching on regime shifts that can inform
   policy and practice and ultimately enhance our collective ability to
   manage and govern large, abrupt, systemic changes in the Anthropocene.},

Title = {Applying a social-ecological well-being approach to enhance
   opportunities for marine protected area governance},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The design and implementation of ecologically effective marine protected
   areas (MPAs) are influenced by social acceptance and the impact of MPAs
   on communities. Integrative analyses of the social and ecological
   determinants of marine conservation efforts and MPA networks are lacking
   but are needed to achieve desired outcomes. We developed and applied a
   ``social-ecological well-being{''} (SEWB) approach to critically examine
   the linkages between MPAs and well-being in Southwest New Brunswick (Bay
   of Fundy, Canada). SEWB is defined as a social-ecological system state
   in which ecological resilience is sustained, while human needs are met
   and the quality of life of individuals is maintained. We examined (1)
   how stakeholders perceive benefits and costs of MPAs in relation to
   SEWB, and (2) how well-being insights contribute to the effectiveness of
   MPA governance. Using a qualitative case study approach, we conducted 49
   semistructured interviews and 4 focus groups with fishers and other key
   informants at an existing MPA, as well as at an ecologically and
   biologically significant area that is a candidate for a future MPA. We
   identified 15 attributes of SEWB that related to MPAs, such as fishery
   access, community relations, place identity, and natural capital. Three
   key governance insights for decision makers emerged from the
   identification of these attributes: (1) displacement attributable to
   MPAs has implications across material, relational, subjective, and
   ecological dimensions; (2) effective collaboration is critical for
   community support, but perspectives about what constitutes effective
   collaboration may vary across stakeholder groups; and (3) aspects of MPA
   design fit poorly with the local context because they do not take social
   and ecological dynamics into account. Our findings empirically
   demonstrate the applicability of the SEWB framework, suggest a need to
   focus more on governance processes and improving fit, and highlight
   barriers to aligning national and local conservation priorities.},

Title = {Understanding the dynamics of fish politics: The role of diverse actor
   interactions in transformations towards co-management},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {195-205},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Co-management is often put forward as a way to foster sustainability and
   improve the adaptive capacity of smallscale fisheries. Transformations
   towards co-management are enabled by processes that support social
   change, such as nurturing leadership, collective action and learning, as
   well as political processes that change legislative frameworks from
   centralized to decentralized decision-making. However, major policy
   changes can be difficult and change-actors often fail to overcome
   barriers created by institutional friction, dominant policy discourses
   or powerful interests supporting the status quo. In the literature,
   special attention has been paid to social processes that foster
   cooperation, the role of bridging-actors on the path towards
   co-management, or conditions that influence its effective
   implementation. In this paper we shift the attention to political
   decision-making and changes in policy discourse as an integral part of
   fisheries' transformations. We use the well-studied cases of
   comanagement transformations in small-scale fisheries to identify how
   interactions among political actors and stakeholders, as well as
   social-ecological interactions, shaped the policy discourse and
   influenced policy change during the transformation process. By comparing
   how policy change emerged across four fishery transformation cases, we
   illustrate the importance of (cross-scale and cross-type) coordination
   and collaboration among diverse political actors in creating conditions
   for adoption of legislation, as well as its timing during the policy
   process. The paper contributes to the literature on sustainability
   transformations by explaining how policy changes supporting such
   transformations may emerge, in addition to providing insight on
   political conditions and processes that could be fostered in order to
   support policy change towards decentralization in fisheries.},

Title = {Unraveling the combined effects of sociopolitical and climate change
   scenarios for an artisanal small-scale fishery in the Western
   Mediterranean},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Worldwide climate change will influence the spatial distribution and
   status of exploited fish stocks, often in uncertain ways with cascading
   effects on the social-ecological systems depending on them. Likewise,
   changes in sociopolitical conditions influencing consumer demand, fuel,
   and fish prices may jeopardize the viability of fisheries. Predicting
   whether existing management systems can adapt to these changes is key
   and especially challenging in data-poor fisheries. In the Mediterranean
   Sea, the tropical and subtropical dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) is
   at its northernmost reproductive distribution area and has sustained a
   seasonal age-0 based artisanal small-scale fishery since ancient times.
   We built a quantitative Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model integrating
   a diverse set of ecological, social, and economic input data to assess
   the impact of plausible midterm futures (2040-2059) on the seasonal
   economic profit for dolphinfish fishers in Mallorca (Balearic Islands,
   Western Mediterranean). These future scenarios accounted for increasing
   sea surface temperature based on global IPCC projections, population
   dynamics and growth of dolphinfish, economic forecasts of future fish
   and fuel prices, and stakeholders' views on feasible adaptations of the
   local management system. Seven out of twelve scenarios point towards
   increased profitability for fishers. To date, the fishery is managed
   locally although within a wider EU regulatory framework, and options
   such as advancing the opening date of the fishing season in response to
   climate-induced changes in growth and body size of dolphinfish might be
   economically beneficial. This will, however, depend critically on the
   evolution of unknown factors such as changes in other target species,
   consumption habits of people, and market dynamics. We show here that,
   even in fisheries without information on stock status, an integrated and
   holistic assessment of adaptive capacities of management systems is
   possible.},

Title = {Sustainability transformations: socio-political shocks as opportunities
   for governance transitions},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Faced with accelerating environmental challenges, research on
   social-ecological systems is increasingly focused on the need for
   transformative change towards sustainable stewardship of natural
   resources. This paper analyses the potential of rapid, large-scale
   socio-political change as a window of opportunity for transformative
   change of natural resources governance. We hypothesize that shocks at
   higher levels of social organization may open up opportunities for
   transformation of social-ecological systems into new pathways of
   development. However, opportunities need to be carefully navigated
   otherwise transformations may stall or lead the social-ecological system
   in undesirable directions. We investigate (i) under which circumstances
   socio-political change has been used by actors as a window of
   opportunity for initiating transformation towards sustainable natural
   resource governance, (ii) how the different levels of the systems
   (landscape, regime and niche) interact to pave the way for initiating
   such transformations and (iii) which key features (cognitive, structural
   and agency-related) get mobilized for transformation. This is achieved
   through analyzing natural resource governance regimes of countries that
   have been subject to rapid, large-scale political change: water
   governance in South Africa and Uzbekistan and governance of coastal
   fisheries in Chile. In South Africa the political and economic change of
   the end of the apartheid regime resulted in a transformation of the
   water governance regime while in Uzbekistan after the breakdown of the
   Soviet Union change both at the economic and political scales and within
   the water governance regime remained superficial. In Chile the
   democratization process after the Pinochet era was used to transform the
   governance of coastal fisheries. The paper concludes with important
   insight on key capacities needed to navigate transformation towards
   biosphere stewardship. The study also contributes to a more nuanced view
   on the relationship between collapse and renewal.},

Title = {Identifying potential consequences of natural perturbations and
   management decisions on a coastal fishery social-ecological system using
   qualitative loop analysis},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Managing for sustainable development and resource extraction requires an
   understanding of the feedbacks between ecosystems and humans. These
   feedbacks are part of complex social-ecological systems (SES), in which
   resources, actors, and governance systems interact to produce outcomes
   across these component parts. Qualitative modeling approaches offer ways
   to assess complex SES dynamics. Loop analysis in particular is useful
   for examining and identifying potential outcomes from external
   perturbations and management interventions in data poor systems when
   very little is known about functional relationships and parameter
   values. Using a case study of multispecies, multifleet coastal
   small-scale fisheries, we demonstrate the application of loop analysis
   to provide predictions regarding SES responses to perturbations and
   management actions. Specifically, we examine the potential ecological
   and socioeconomic consequences to coastal fisheries of different
   governance interventions (e.g., territorial user rights, fisheries
   closures, market-based incentives, ecotourism subsidies) and
   environmental changes. Our results indicate that complex feedbacks among
   biophysical and socioeconomic components can result in counterintuitive
   and unexpected outcomes. For example, creating new jobs through
   ecotourism or subsidies might have mixed effects on members of fishing
   cooperatives vs. nonmembers, highlighting equity issues. Market-based
   interventions, such as ecolabels, are expected to have overall positive
   economic effects, assuming a direct effect of ecolabels on marketprices,
   and a lack of negative biological impacts under most model structures.
   Our results highlight that integrating ecological and social variables
   in a unique unit of management can reveal important potential trade-offs
   between desirable ecological and social outcomes, highlight which user
   groups might be more vulnerable to external shocks, and identify which
   interventions should be further tested to identify potential win-win
   outcomes across the triple-bottom line of the sustainable development
   paradigm.},

Title = {Specialization of fishers leads to greater impact of external
   disturbance: Evidence from a social-ecological network modelling
   exercise for Sechura Bay, northern Peru},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {179},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Coastal marine resources provide livelihoods to human communities around
   the world. The interactions in respective social-ecological systems are
   usually of complex nature, due to a wide range of different fisheries
   interacting with the ecosystem. Understanding connectivity within these
   systems (i.e. among social and ecological actors) helps in establishing
   meaningful management strategies for sustainable use of marine
   resources. This work uses the value chain analysis of different
   fisheries sectors to construct a qualitative social-ecological network
   (SEN) model of the Sechura Bay in North Peru. Here, a diverse ensemble
   of small-scale fisheries coexists with a flourishing mariculture sector,
   though the respective production chains partially overlap. Directed and
   unweighted links between actors were defined based on the transfer of
   biomass (trophic interactions) and money (economic interactions).
   Several analytical network tools were applied (e.g. degree centrality,
   dominator tree) to identify the most important nodes of the
   social-ecological network and to understand interdependencies. Results
   of the network analysis suggest position of system's components being
   related to their vulnerability in the face of external disturbances.
   Fisher groups with a high specialization with respect to fisheries
   target species were stronger impacted by the last strong El Nifio event
   (the Coastal El Nifio 2017), with drastic consequences for actors of the
   respective production chains. The present approach is envisioned to be
   applicable beyond this particular case study and to nourish on-going
   scientific discussions on the use of social-ecological network analysis
   to describe human-nature interactions. This study allows (i) estimating
   node (actor) susceptibilities to natural and anthropogenic disturbances,
   and (ii) reconciling sustainable resource use and nature conservation by
   enhancing the understanding of the functionality of the respective
   social-ecological system.},

Title = {Complexities and Uncertainties in Transitioning Small-Scale Coral Reef
   Fisheries},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Coral reef fisheries support the development of local and national
   economies and are the basis of important cultural practices and
   worldviews. Transitioning economies, human development, and
   environmental stress can harm this livelihood. Here we focus on a
   transitioning social-ecological system as a case study (Moorea, French
   Polynesia). We review fishing practices and three decades of effort and
   landing estimates with the broader goal of informing management. Fishery
   activities in Moorea are quite challenging to quantify because of the
   diversity of gears used, the lack of centralized access points or
   markets, the high participation rates of the population in the fishery,
   and the overlapping cultural and economic motivations to catch fish.
   Compounding this challenging diversity, we lack a basic understanding of
   the complex interplay between the cultural, subsistence, and commercial
   use of Moorea's reefs. In Moorea, we found an order of magnitude gap
   between estimates of fishery yield produced by catch monitoring methods
   (similar to 2 t km(-2) year(-1)) and estimates produced using
   consumption or participatory socioeconomic consumer surveys (similar to
   24 t km(-2) year(-1)), Several lines of evidence suggest reef resources
   may be overexploited and stakeholders have a diversity of opinions as to
   whether trends in the stocks are a cause for concern. The reefs,
   however, remain ecologically resilient. The relative health of the reef
   is striking given the socio-economic context. Moorea has a relatively
   high population density, a modern economic system linked into global
   flows of trade and travel, and the fishery has little remaining
   traditional or customary management. Other islands in the Pacific in
   similar contexts in Polynesia such as Hawaii, that continue to develop
   economically, may have small-scale fisheries that increasingly resemble
   Moorea. Therefore, understanding Moorea's reef fisheries may provide
   insight into their future.},

Title = {How to structure and prioritize information needs in support of
   monitoring design for Integrated Coastal Management},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {86},
Pages = {23-33},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Integrated Coastal Management cannot operate effectively without
   reliable information and knowledge on changes in the environment and on
   the causes of those changes. Monitoring is essential to provide data
   needed for a real understanding of socio-economic and ecological
   functioning in multi-user nature areas. We present a web-based and
   comprehensive assessment methodology to articulate, structure and
   prioritize information needs and ensuing monitoring needs. We applied
   this methodology in the Dutch Wadden Sea Region, which includes a
   designated UNESCO World Heritage nature reserve. The methodology
   consists of the following steps: i) exploring social-ecological issues
   of concern and defining the monitoring scope; ii) articulating
   information needs expressed as tractable questions; iii) elaborating
   monitoring needs; iv) grounding in scientific models and current
   monitoring; v) synthesizing assessment findings into target entities,
   i.e. analysis variables for monitoring. In this paper we focus on the
   first three steps. As part of our methodology we performed two online
   surveys amongst a broad range of stakeholders and amongst monitoring
   professionals. In the case of the Dutch Wadden Sea Region, main
   monitoring questions were related to biodiversity and food web
   relations; effects of fisheries and its pressures on the ecosystem;
   channel and port dredging; spatial planning and multifunctional use;
   sustainable energy production; and effects of changing storm regimes due
   to climate change. Subsequently we elaborated these general issues into
   analysis variables within five themes. The presented methodology enables
   large scale and unbiased involvement of stakeholders in articulating
   information needs in a multi-user nature reserve like the Wadden Sea. In
   addition the methodology facilitates the input and feedback of
   monitoring professionals by providing a detailed elaboration of
   monitoring needs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Transforming the social-ecological systems framework into a knowledge
   exchange and deliberation tool for comanagement},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {The social-ecological system framework (SESF) can be useful for applied
   research and management practice beyond its traditional academic
   applications. In this article we transform the SESF into an image-based
   practical tool to facilitate knowledge exchange and deliberation
   processes within community-based natural resource comanagement settings.
   We develop a transdisciplinary methodology to transform the SESF into
   simple and context relevant images that are understandable by
   nonspecialists, yet the image-based framework still conveys its core
   tenets of systems thinking, a checklist for system complexity and
   conceptualizing social-ecological interactions. We then demonstrate a
   mixed-method approach for testing the usefulness of the image-based
   framework for enhancing communication, knowledge exchange, and
   deliberation processes. We show how the academic uses of the SESF, its
   core tenets, can serve the same purpose for nonacademic actors. When
   transformed, the image-based SESF has potential to be a tool that can
   enhance communication and knowledge exchange between actors in
   governance settings. We demonstrate our methodology with small-scale
   fishers involved with comanagement in the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica. In
   the example, we show how scientists must learn from fishers, to
   understand how they view their system, in order to make the image-based
   tool useful in context. We then test its usefulness by exploring the
   hypothesis that the image-based framework can help fishers discuss with
   more depth and complexity because it provides a simple conceptual base
   for systems thinking and a core set of variables to consider as
   interacting. Furthermore, we explore how using the framework during
   deliberation may be able to alter the social-psychological outcomes of
   participants using field experimental methods. We discuss our combined
   methodology, for transforming the framework and measuring deliberation
   impacts, while reflecting on new ways of thinking about how the SESF can
   be useful for applied research and practice.},

Title = {Eutrophication, water quality, and fisheries: a wicked management
   problem with insights from a century of change in Lake Erie},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Human-driven nutrient inputs into aquatic ecosystems must be managed to
   preserve biodiversity and to ensure that valued fishery and water
   quality services are not compromised by hypoxia and harmful algal
   blooms. Aiming for nutrient inputs that achieve an intermediate level of
   ecosystem productivity is expected to provide both high fish yield and
   good water quality. However, we argue that such an intermediate
   ``optimum{''} may not exist for many aquatic ecosystems that support
   multiple fisheries with differing tolerances to eutrophication and that
   must provide multiple water quality services. We further support this
   argument with an empirical case study of nearly a century (1915-2011) of
   change in the productivity of Lake Erie and its lake whitefish
   (Coregonus clupeaformis), walleye (Sander vitreus), and yellow perch
   (Perca flavescens) fisheries. We discuss and show how the harvest of
   each fishery has been historically maximized at different levels of
   ecosystem productivity. Additionally, we examine how anticipated
   management efforts to improve water quality by reducing nutrient inputs
   (i.e., oligotrophication) may favor certain fisheries over others,
   resulting in no single optimal range of nutrient inputs that achieves
   all valued fishery and water quality objectives. Our synthesis and case
   study illustrate how the need to balance multiple services in aquatic
   ecosystems can create a wicked management problem with inevitable
   trade-offs. To navigate these trade-offs, we recommend the use of
   ecosystem-based management approaches, which can help decision makers
   identify and resolve complex trade-offs by facilitating cooperative
   research and communication among water quality regulators, fisheries
   managers, and end users.},

Title = {Participatory modelling for conceptualizing social-ecological system
   dynamics in the Bangladesh delta},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 19},
Abstract = {The concept of complex social-ecological systems (SES) as a means for
   capturing system dynamics properties (e.g. interactions and feedbacks)
   has gained attention in policymaking and advancing evidence in
   understanding complex systems. In contexts with limited data, conceptual
   system dynamic models offer a promising entry point to overcome
   challenges in understanding SES dynamics, which is essential for
   managing the long-term sustainability of SES and human wellbeing. Here,
   we build on previous work focused on agricultural production and use
   participatory approaches to develop a conceptual System Dynamics (SD)
   model for the south-west coastal SES in Bangladesh encompassing multiple
   forms of livelihood (fisheries, shrimp farming and forests, as well as
   agriculture). Using qualitative methods, including focus group
   discussions with farmers, fishermen, shrimp farmers and forest people,
   as well as expert consultations, we identified interactions, feedback
   loops and thresholds for the SES. The conceptual system model developed
   independently by stakeholders is consistent with a model developed using
   an empirical approach and literature review. Feedback loops are
   identified for the ecological (e.g. climate and water, mangrove and
   salinity) and social (e.g. shrimp farming and mangrove, agricultural
   (e.g. crops) production and subsidy) sub-systems in the Bangladesh
   delta. The biophysical thresholds that impact social conditions include
   river water discharge (1500 to 2000 m(3) s(-1)), climate (28 degrees C)
   and soil salinity (similar to 4 to similar to 10 dS m(-1)). Exceeding
   these thresholds suggests that SES may lose resilience in the near
   future and increase the likelihood of regime shifts. Findings of this
   study contribute to the management of the deltaic ecosystem and provide
   specific policy recommendations for improving environmental
   sustainability and human well-being in the Bangladesh delta and can be
   further used as inputs into system dynamic modelling to simulate changes
   in this SES.},

Title = {Towards local governance of marine resources and ecosystems on Easter
   Island},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {27},

Abstract = {1. Social- ecological system sustainability depends in part upon the fit
   between ecosystems and institutions. 2. In 2014, the local community on
   Easter Island started a bottom- up process to improve marine resources
   conservation and management. 3. Local stakeholders formed a working
   group that has regular meetings and goals, such as creating a sea
   council and some basic action plans, thus initiating a local governance
   transformation process. 4. A participatory process was conducted
   together with a local organization that led the marine conservation
   issues on the island to define the factors that could favour and/ or
   undermine the formation of the sea council. Also, the stakeholders that
   must be present in such a sea council were identified. 5. Twelve factors
   that could facilitate or hinder the implementation of a sea council were
   identified. The lack of representativeness of public institutions is a
   major challenge. 6. Public institutions are designed to ensure
   compliance with central government strategies, but the decisions do not
   represent the worldview of islanders. 7. The results showed the
   potential value of conducting a participatory process to identify the
   key issues that could hinder or favour a desired governance
   transformation process. The participatory process also highlighted
   governance mismatches that are important to consider in attempts to
   pursue more effective fishery governance on Easter Island, and other
   Island communities. 8. Centralized governance systems do not respond
   rapidly to locally observed social and ecological dynamics. By contrast,
   a local decision- making system based on traditional laws and local
   governance can more rapidly respond to observed changes. 9. The
   participatory process presented here holds the potential to support
   local people in their planning and coordination for marine conservation
   and management in order to optimize bottom- up change processes
   involving multiple stakeholders with different interests, values and
   levels of power. Copyright \# 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {Conservation for sustaining livelihoods: Adaptive co-management of fish
   no-take zones in the Mekong River},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {265},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A major challenge in natural resource management in developing countries
   is to pursue conservation objectives while avoiding negative impacts on
   local livelihoods. Inland capture fisheries provide opportunities to
   demon-strate an integration of conservation and livelihood objectives
   when managed as a social-ecological system. While numerous marine
   no-take reserves have been found effective for the recovery of
   fisheries, few well-documented examples exist in the freshwater realm.
   Research gaps also remain in the role of co-management in balancing
   various management objectives and resolving conflicts. This paper offers
   critical reflection on adaptive co-management of fish conservation zones
   (FCZs) in the Mekong River in Cambodia and its social-ecological
   outcomes as perceived by local stakeholders. The management approach was
   found generally effec-tive for the local stakeholders to negotiate
   between conservation and livelihood objectives at key stages of the
   implementation, and resolve conflicts; however, the lessons learned were
   not uniform across all sites. The degree of difficulty in conflict
   resolution was mainly a function of the fishing dependency of local
   communities on the protected site, the prevalence of severe poverty in
   adjacent villages, and the availability of livelihood options other than
   fishing. Growing stakeholder perception over time, of the FCZs as
   yielding positive outcomes-for both conservation and
   livelihood-motivated the local communities to create more FCZs. We argue
   clear recognition by local stakeholders of the achievements and the
   fairness in the FCZ management, facilitated through participatory
   approaches, can improve their acceptance of conservation rules and
   enhance their effec-tiveness. However, long-term mechanisms to support
   these community initiatives technically and financially are needed.
   Simple yet scientifically robust approaches for tropical freshwater
   fisheries monitoring, including pe-riodical assessments of indicator
   species, are also needed to facilitate performance evaluation of
   specific man-agement measures locally.},

Volume = {6},
Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {This paper explores the ecosystem services provided by anadromous brown
   trout (often termed sea trout) populations in Norway. Sea trout is an
   important species in both freshwater and marine ecosystems and provides
   important demand-driven ecological provisioning and socio-cultural
   services. While the sea trout once provided an important provisioning
   service through a professional fishery and subsistence fishing, fishing
   for sea trout in the near shore coastal areas and in rivers is today a
   very popular and accessible recreational activity and generates
   primarily socio-cultural services. The recreational fishery contributes
   to local cultural heritage, its folkways and lore, to the development
   and transfer of local ecological knowledge and fishing experience to the
   young and to human well-being. As a salmonid species, the sea trout is
   sensitive to negative environmental conditions in both freshwater and
   marine coastal areas and is in general decline. A recent decision to
   expand production of farmed salmon may increase pressure on stocks. Good
   management of recreational fishing is accordingly important for the
   species to thrive, but knowledge of what fishers value with respect to
   fishing sea trout and what management measures they will accept is
   limited. Researchers sought to capture information about non-extractive
   direct use value (non-monetary) of the sea trout recreational fishery
   using questionnaire surveys targeting Norwegian anglers around the
   country. Results indicate that the most important ecosystem services
   delivered by recreational sea trout fisheries are social-cultural
   ecosystem services at the level of individual fishers; fishing sea trout
   most likely also has important social functions. Fishers are prepared to
   accept stricter management measures that reduce catches and allow
   fishing to continue but they oppose paying higher fees.},

Title = {Integrating Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Fisheries Management in
   the Torres Strait, Australia: the Catalytic Role of Turtles and Dugong
   as Cultural Keystone Species},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {In many developing regions of Melanesia, fishers' traditional ecological
   knowledge (TEK) has been integrated with western science and management
   knowledge (SMK) to generate innovative and effective fisheries
   management. Previous research suggests that three factors initiate this
   process: depleted fishery stocks, limited SMK, and ownership of
   resources by local communities. In other contexts the extent of
   power-sharing through comanagement, and the cultural significance of
   species may also be important determinants of knowledge integration.
   Here we assess the role of these factors in the application of TEK in
   the Torres Strait Islands, Australia, where commercial and subsistence
   fisheries are fundamental to the Indigenous Melanesian culture and
   livelihoods. In 2009 we surveyed fishery managers and scientists who
   revealed that TEK had only been recently and sparingly applied in four
   fisheries (turtle, dugong, lobster, and hand collectables), and only two
   of the seven species concerned had a combination of depleted stocks, low
   SMK, and high community ownership. Instead, comanagement characteristics
   and the cultural value of species were the primary determinants of TEK
   application. We suggest that turtles and dugong are cultural keystone
   species that simultaneously provide important ecosystem services to both
   islanders' livelihoods and international conservation interests.
   Combined with their ecological scale these species have catalyzed
   comanagement between indigenous and government stakeholders,
   precipitating the application of TEK in other fisheries of lesser
   cultural importance. We discuss modifications to governance required to
   enable knowledge integration to evolve further through adaptive
   comanagement, and its role in enhancing fisheries management and thus
   the resilience of the Torres Strait social-ecological system. Our study
   highlights the potential utility of cultural keystone species in
   stimulating cross-cultural resource governance in developed economies
   such as Australia.},

Title = {Harnessing scientific and local knowledge to face climate change in
   small-scale fisheries},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {68},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Small-scale fisheries in developing regions are particularly vulnerable
   to climate change, but the assessment of climate-induced changes and
   impacts are often hampered by the data poor-situation of these
   social-ecological systems. Based on 40 years of scientific and local
   ecological knowledge, we provide a coherent narrative about the effects
   of a marine hotspot of climate change on a small-scale fishery across
   different geographical and temporal scales. We applied a mixed-methods
   approach to assess biophysical changes, social-ecological impacts, and
   the incremental spectrum of actions implemented at multiple levels to
   increase the adaptive capacity of a small-scale clam fishery. The
   warming hotspot here analyzed was the fastest-warming region in the
   South Atlantic Ocean. Long-term changes in wind intensity and direction
   were also noticeable at a regional scale. Both sea surface temperature
   and winds showed a clear shifting pattern in the late 1990 s. These
   climate-related stressors determined ecosystem and targeted population
   changes (e.g. clam mass mortalities, slow stock recovery rates after
   ecological shocks, habitat narrowing), and favored harmful algal
   bloom-forming organisms. Climate-induced drivers also affected the human
   component of the social-ecological system, preventing fishers from
   securing a fulltime livelihood and limiting the fishery economic
   potential. Adaptive responses at multiple levels provided some capacity
   to address climate change effects, and transformative pathways are being
   taken to adapt to climate-induced changes over the long-term.
   Transformative changes were fostered by the local perception of
   environmental change, shared narratives, sustained scientific monitoring
   programs, and the interaction between knowledge systems, facilitated by
   a bridging organization within a broader process of governance
   transformation. The combination of autonomous adaptations (based on
   linking social capital and fishery leaders agency) and government-led
   adaptations were essential to face the challenges imposed by climate
   change. Our results serve as a learning platform to anticipate threats
   and envision solutions to a wide range of small-scale fisheries in
   fast-warming regions worldwide.},

Title = {Monitoring consumptive resource use i n South African national parks},
Journal = {KOEDOE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {61},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 30},
Abstract = {Monitoring is an essential component of measuring the performance of
   protected areas. This requirement led to the development of a
   biodiversity monitoring system for South African National Parks
   (SANParks). The system comprises of ten major programmes, each focusing
   on a core area of conservation biodiversity monitoring, with resource
   use being one of the focal areas. With the growing appreciation of the
   importance of natural resources for the socioeconomic well-being of
   communities and other stakeholders, sustainable resource use is an
   important component of the management of natural areas and national
   parks. To gauge sustainability, a sound monitoring and research
   programme that fits within the context of the SANParks' adaptive
   management approach towards social-ecological system management is
   required. The purpose of this article was to define the context and
   scope in which consumptive resource use takes place within SANParks and
   to outline the criteria necessary for developing a sound monitoring
   programme to assess the sustainability of such use. The monitoring
   programme is structured in view of the fact that sustainable resource
   use is achievable only where all dimensions of sustainability (social,
   economic and ecological) are considered simultaneously. In terms of the
   social and economic dimensions of sustainability, the programme provides
   for assessing stakeholder needs, trends in resource use and the social
   and economic impacts of resource use. Monitoring that relates to the
   ecological dimension of sustainability of biological resource use deals
   with the rate of turnover and population dynamics of target species, as
   well as harvest impact. In terms of abiotic (non-renewable) resources,
   monitoring deals with sound management practices to minimise impact on
   the environment, and to optimise benefits through responsible use.
   Conservation implications: The resource use monitoring programme is
   intended to ensure that monitoring relating to the harvesting of natural
   resources from national parks is scientifically sound and conducted in a
   structured way, towards meeting the objective of sustainable use and
   compliance with national legislation. The article illustrates how
   SANParks meets its obligation to monitor biodiversity conservation while
   at the same time meeting the needs for the consumptive use of resources.},

Title = {Resilience strategies in the face of short- and long-term change:
   out-migration and fisheries regulation in Alaskan fishing communities},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Historically, communities persisted in remote, isolated areas of Alaska
   in large part because of the abundance of marine and terrestrial
   resources, as well as the ability of local people to opportunistically
   access those resources as they became available. Species switching and
   the ability to shift effort away from fisheries during poor years
   allowed local residents to diversify their livelihoods in the face of
   uncertainties and ecological change. The advent of modern fisheries
   management, which views Alaskan fisheries as the property of all
   citizens of the United States, has fundamentally altered the
   relationship of place-based communities to fishery resources. Local
   access to fisheries has been particularly affected by the development of
   transferable fishing privileges, making it possible for fishing rights
   to leave place-based communities through the choices of individual
   community members to sell or to move away. When fishing communities in
   Alaska lose active fishing businesses, over time the loss of various
   types of community capital will follow, including human, social,
   cultural, technical, and financial capital. In some cases, communities
   are able to adapt or transform through diversification of their local
   economies. In other cases, no alternatives to a fishery-based economy
   are accessible. We have used resilience theory to explore drivers of
   change affecting Alaskan fishing communities. Emphasis was placed on two
   primary change drivers, the regulatory environment and rural
   out-migration, as well as their interconnections and their impacts on
   individuals, communities, and the larger social-ecological system. We
   summarized several government programs that have been implemented to
   support the continued participation of communities in Alaskan fisheries.
   In addition, we reviewed informal and private-sector efforts to generate
   resilience strategies that can facilitate new entry into fisheries or
   retain fishing businesses and fishing rights within communities, as well
   as respond to increasing uncertainty related to the global market and
   climate changes.},

Title = {A case study from the southern Cape linefishery 2: Considering one's

Journal = {SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {113},
Number = {5-6},

Abstract = {Fishers in the small-scale, commercial linefishery in the southern Cape,
   South Africa, are exposed to variability and change in the marine
   social-ecological system of which they are a part. Faced with
   multi-scalar changes within this complex system, fishers employ a wide
   range of strategies in reaction to change. As part of a broader study of
   stressors that bring about change in these systems, this contribution
   examines the fishers' responses to these changes and is based on a
   participant-led, semi-structured interview process of skippers/boat
   owners, crew, processors and spouses/partners, in six communities in the
   southern Cape region, and has been supplemented with appropriate
   secondary data. The results are discussed using a resilience framework.
   The data were initially considered thematically by stressor, but results
   identified that a place-based analysis was equally important. Three
   major groupings were identified: (1) fishers who adapt and show clear
   business-orientation, (2) fishers who cope, and (3) fishers who react
   and are thus caught in a poverty trap. In addition to place-specific
   history, local feedback loops and indirect effects need to be better
   accounted for to understand these responses to change at various scales.
   The results of this study are expected to contribute to the basis of
   scenario planning in the region.
   Significance:
   Analysis of responses to change strategies provides insight into
   resilience displayed as well as costs and benefits of strategies.
   The description of strategies provides valuable insights into the
   decision-making processes in linefishery in the southern Cape.
   Cognitive and reflexive decision-making processes are shaped by
   individuals' and communities' experiences of past and present.
   Practical implications of actions are not always the overriding concern
   in decision-making, which underscores the importance and influence of
   culture.
   These results provide important insights into a system that is not well
   described, and highlight knowledge gaps that require further
   context-specific research.},

Abstract = {Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) studies how institutions
   (the rules of the game of a society) determine the performance of a
   social-economic system. Elinor Ostrom extends the institutional analysis
   to the collective action for a particular case, the study of the
   social-ecological systems (SESs) (Ostrom 1990). Any group that attempts
   to manage a common resource (e.g. aquifers, pastures) for optimal
   sustainable production must solve a set of problems in order to create
   institutions to facilitate collective action. Some evidences show that
   following a set of design principles in creating institutions can lead
   to overcome these problems. The aim of the paper is to apply the SES
   framework to an artisanal fishery community in Argentina in order to: 1)
   describe the principal features, key variables and relations of the
   small-scale fishery system; 2) detect the principal drivers of a
   potential common-management and the leading detractors from the current
   communal performance; and 3) analyze the possibility that a
   self-governing for sustainable fishery may appear. Several drivers for
   potential common-management and some detractors from the current common
   performance are summarized. Artisanal fishery SES is currently at a
   bifurcation point. A common historical and cultural root, the presence
   of leaderships, the relevance of local knowledge, the dependence on the
   resource to sustainable livelihoods and the threat of big-scale
   fisheries area have generated incentives to collectiveaction. But,
   simultaneously, internal conflicts are the most important barrier for an
   integrated community-based management. The heterogeneity among actors
   and the relevant external conditions have resulted in two groups
   diverging in their self-organization. The work is framed by the project
   COMET-LA (COmmunity-based Management of Environmental challenges in
   Latin America; European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme of
   Research and Development), which aims to identify sustainable
   community-based governance for the management of natural resources that
   can be used in different social-ecological systems in a context of
   climate change and increasing competition in the use of resources.},

Title = {Integrating societal perspectives and values for improved stewardship of
   a coastal ecosystem engineer},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Oyster reefs provide coastal societies with a vast array of ecosystem
   services, but are also destructively harvested as an economically and
   culturally important fishery resource, exemplifying a complex
   social-ecological system (SES). Historically, societal demand for
   oysters has led to destructive and unsustainable levels of harvest,
   which coupled with multiple other stressors has placed oyster reefs
   among the most globally imperiled coastal habitats. However, more recent
   studies have demonstrated that large-scale restoration is possible and
   that healthy oyster populations can be sustained with effective
   governance and stewardship. However, both of these require significant
   societal support or financial investment. In our study, we explored
   relationships among how coastal societies (1) perceive and value oyster
   ecosystem services, (2) recognize and define problems associated with
   oyster decline, and (3) perceive or support stewardship initiatives. We
   specifically focused on the SES of eastern oysters (Crassostrea
   virginica) and coastal societies in the northern Gulf of Mexico, a
   region identified as offering among the last and best opportunities to
   sustainably balance conservation objectives with a wild fishery. We
   found that, in addition to harvest-related benefits, oysters were highly
   valued for providing habitat, mitigating shoreline erosion, and
   improving water quality or clarity. Our results also showed that
   although most respondents recognized that oyster populations have
   declined, many respondents characterized the problem differently than
   most scientific literature does. Among a variety of initiatives for
   enhancing sustainability, spawning sanctuaries and reef restoration were
   well supported in all states, but support for harvest reductions was
   less consistent. Our study suggests that public support for maintaining
   both harvest and ecosystem services exists at societal levels and that
   enhancing public awareness regarding the extent and causes of oyster
   decline could garner additional support for stewardship initiatives.
   Collectively, the societal, economic, and biophysical complexities of
   the northern Gulf of Mexico oyster SES illustrate the need and public
   support for developing more comprehensive management schemes for
   exploited ecosystem engineers.},

Abstract = {For decades, multiple anthropogenic stressors have threatened the
   Galapagos Islands. Widespread marine pollution such as oil spills,
   persistent organic pollutants, metals, and ocean plastic pollution has
   been linked to concerning changes in the ecophysiology and health of
   Galapagos species. Simultaneously, illegal, unreported, and unregulated
   fishing are reshaping the composition and structure of endemic and
   native Galapagos pelagic communities. In this novel review, we discuss
   the impact of anthropogenic pollutants and their associated
   ecotoxicological implications for Galapagos species in the face of
   climate change stressors. We emphasize the importance of considering
   fishing pressure and marine pollution, in combination with
   climate-change impacts, when assessing the evolutionary fitness of
   species inhabiting the Galapagos. For example, the survival of endemic
   marine iguanas has been negatively affected by organic hydrocarbons
   introduced via oil spills, and endangered Galapagos sea lions exhibit
   detectable concentrations of DDT, triggering potential feminization
   effects and compromising the species' survival. During periods of ocean
   warming (El Nino events) when endemic species undergo nutritional
   stress, climate change may increase the vulnerability of these species
   to the impacts of pollutants, resulting in the species reaching its
   population tipping point. Marine plastics are emerging as a deleterious
   and widespread threat to endemic species. The Galapagos is treasured for
   its historical significance and its unparalleled living laboratory and
   display of evolutionary processes; however, this unique and iconic
   paradise will remain in jeopardy until multidisciplinary and
   comprehensive preventative management plans are put in place to mitigate
   and eliminate the effects of anthropogenic stressors facing the islands
   today. We present a critical analysis and synthesis of anthropogenic
   stressors with some progress from local and international institutional
   efforts and call to action more precautionary measures along with new
   management philosophies focused on understanding the processes of change
   through research to champion the conservation of the Galapagos. Integr

Title = {Transforming (perceived) rigidity in environmental law through adaptive
   governance: a case of Endangered Species Act implementation},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is often portrayed as a major source of
   instability and crisis in river basins of the U.S. West, where the needs
   of listed fish species frequently clash with agriculture dependent on
   federal irrigation projects subject to ESA Section 7 prohibitions on
   federal agency actions likely to jeopardize listed species or adversely
   modify critical habitat. Scholarship on Section 7 characterizes the
   process as unwaveringly rigid, the legal ``hammer{''} forcing federal
   agencies to consider endangered species' needs when proposing operations
   and management plans for federally funded irrigation. In this paper, we
   identify barriers to an integrated approach to Section 7 implementation
   and characterize a set of strategies for overcoming its rigidity that
   may have broader applicability. We draw on lessons derived from the
   Klamath Basin along the Oregon-California border, where cross-scale
   processes and venues involving interagency collaboration among leaders
   in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries
   Service, and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation supported efforts to replace
   an ecologically and socially fragmented Upper Basin/Lower Basin approach
   to ESA implementation fraught with conflict. The result was the nation's
   first joint biological opinion (BiOp), which effectively
   institutionalized an adaptive, flexible, integrated approach to water
   sharing among competing interests. Keys to success included existing
   collaborative capacity related to shifting stakeholder networks, trust,
   and relationships and a shift in local agency culture facilitated by
   empathic leadership leading to a greater sense of shared responsibility
   for Section 7 compliance. A collaborative hydrologic modeling process
   enhanced participatory capacity, facilitated transformative social and
   technical learning, and cultivated greater understanding of the
   social-ecological system among key stakeholders. The 2013 joint BiOp
   exemplifies both governmental capacity for flexibility and evolution
   within the constraints of formal law and the potential for greater
   integration among federal agencies and between federal agencies and
   stakeholders involved in ESA implementation.},

Title = {Spatial complexity, resilience, and policy diversity: Fishing on
   lake-rich landscapes},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The dynamics of and policies governing spatially coupled
   social-ecological mosaics are considered for the case of fisheries in a
   lake district. A microeconomic model of households addresses agent
   decisions at three hierarchic levels: (1) selection of the lake district
   from among a larger set of alternative places to live or visit, (2)
   selection of a base location within the lake district, and (3) selection
   of a portfolio of ecosystem services to use. Ecosystem services are
   represented by dynamics of fish production subject to multiple stable
   domains and trophic cascades. Policy calculations show that optimal
   policies will be highly heterogeneous in space and fluid in time. The
   diversity of possible outcomes is illustrated by simulations for a
   hypothetical lake district based loosely on the Northern Highlands of
   the State of Wisconsin. Lake districts are frequently managed as if
   lakes were independent, similar, endogenously regulating systems. Our
   findings contradict that view. One-size-fits-all (OSFA) policies erode
   ecological and social resilience. If regulations are too stringent,
   social resilience declines because of the potential rewards of
   overharvesting. If regulations are too lax, ecological resilience is
   diminished by overharvesting in some lakes. In either case, local
   collapses of fish populations evoke spatial shifts of angling effort
   that can lead to serial collapses in neighboring fisheries and degraded
   fisheries in most or all of the lakes. Under OSFA management, the
   natural resources of the entire landscape become more vulnerable to
   transformation because of changes in, e.g., human population, the demand
   for resources, or fish harvesting technology. Multiplicity of management
   regimes can increase the ecological resilience, social resilience, and
   inclusive value of a spatially heterogeneous social-ecological system.
   Because of the complex interactions of mobile people and multistable
   ecosystems, management regimes must also be flexible over time. A
   rights-based scheme may facilitate policy regimes with appropriate
   spatial patterns and intertemporal fluidity. In lake fisheries, habitat
   protection adds an important dimension to policy design. Habitat is a
   slowly changing variable that creates ecological resilience and thereby
   provides managers with a broader range of options.},

Title = {Developing social-ecological system indicators using group model
   building},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {109},
Pages = {29-39},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In many coastal regions, activities of multiple users present a growing
   strain on the ecological state of the area. The necessity of using
   integrative system approaches to understand and solve coastal problems
   has become obvious in the last decades. Integrated management strategies
   for social-ecological systems (SESs) call for the development of SES
   indicators that help (i) to identify and link the states and processes
   of social, economic and ecological subsystems and (ii) to balance
   different stakeholder objectives over the long-term within natural
   limits. Here we use a system dynamics modeling approach called group
   model building (GMB) as a diagnostic participative tool for
   understanding the determinants of characteristic SES issues in the Dutch
   Wadden Sea region and exploring salient SES indicators for management.
   We used GMB in two separate workshops for two distinct cases:
   sustainable mussel fisheries and tourism development. Follow-up online
   questionnaires elicited relevant variables for deriving SES indicators.
   In both modeling cases participants identified and connected the
   variables that expressed fundamental SES dynamics driving each issue. In
   the mussel fisheries model the central part of the structure was the
   interaction between the model variables `extent of mussel habitat with
   high natural value', `mussel cultivation efficiency', and `market
   supply'. In the tourism model a key driving force for explaining tourist
   development was the reciprocal relation between the model variables
   `natural value', `experience value', and `number of tourists'.
   Application of GMB revealed SES issue complexity and explicitly
   identified key linkages and potential SES indicators for policy and
   management in the Dutch Wadden Sea area. As a tool for stakeholder
   involvement in integrated coastal management the approach enables the
   joint building of system understanding and the exchange of individual
   perspectives. Participants agreed with the jointly created models and
   highly appreciated the way the structured approach facilitated
   communication and learning about complex and contested issues. (C) 2015

Title = {Stakeholder-Informed Ecosystem Modeling of Ocean Warming and
   Acidification Impacts in the Barents Sea Region},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Climate change and ocean acidification are anticipated to alter marine
   ecosystems, with consequences for the provision of marine resources and
   ecosystem services to human societies. However, considerable
   uncertainties about future ecological changes and ensuing socio-economic
   impacts impede the identification of societal adaptation strategies. In
   a case study from the Barents Sea and Northern Norwegian Sea region, we
   integrated stakeholder perceptions of ecological changes and their
   significance for societies with the current state of scientific
   knowledge, to investigate the marine-human system under climate change
   and identify societal adaptation options. Stakeholders were engaged
   through personal interviews, two local workshops, and a web based
   survey, identifying the most relevant ecosystem services potentially
   impacted and developing an integrated system dynamics model which links
   climate change scenarios to the response of relevant species.
   Stakeholder perceptions of temperature-dependent multiannual
   fluctuations of fish stocks, interactions among fish, marine mammal, and
   seabird populations, and ecological processes such as primary production
   are represented in the model. The model was used for a discourse-based
   stakeholder evaluation of potential ecosystem changes under ocean
   warming and acidification scenarios, identifying shifts in ecosystem
   service provision and discussing associated societal adaptation options.
   The results pointed to differences in adaptive capacity among user
   groups. Small-scale fishers and tourism businesses are potentially more
   affected by changing spatial distribution and local declines in marine
   species than industrial fisheries. Changes in biodiversity, especially
   extinctions of polar species, and ecosystem functioning were a concern
   from an environmental conservation viewpoint. When considering potential
   additional impacts of ocean acidification, changes observed in the model
   projections were more uniformly valued as negative, and associated with
   an increased potential for conflicts among user groups. The
   stakeholder-informed ecosystem modeling approach has succeeded in
   driving a discussion and interchange among stakeholder groups and with
   scientists, integrating knowledge about climate change impacts in the
   social-ecological system and identifying important factors that shape
   societal responses. The approach can thus serve to improve governance of
   marine systems by incorporating knowledge about system dynamics and
   about societal uses and values.},

Title = {A modified diagnostic social-ecological system framework for lobster
   fisheries: Case implementation and sustainability assessment in Southern
   California},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {204-217},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Fisheries exemplify the immense complexity of interactions in
   social-ecological systems (SESs). This complexity has created management
   challenges and raises concerns for the sustainability of our marine
   natural resource systems. This article contributes to SES fisheries
   research and management in two ways: first, it enhances our
   understanding of lobster fisheries as complex social-ecological systems,
   focusing on the Southern California Spiny Lobster Fishery (SCSLF) as a
   case study. Secondly, it demonstrates a methodological approach for
   assessing component interactions in SESs that can be used to assess the
   sustainability of management approaches. The first contribution involves
   the systematic review of the literature on lobster fisheries management
   and their SES characteristics. The review results are then used to
   modify and extensively define the diagnostic SES framework for specific
   use in lobster fisheries. For the second contribution, we demonstrate
   how to operationalize the modified framework for the diagnosis of a
   real-life case, using the SCSLF as an example. This involves framing the
   SCSLF classificatory diagnosis for analysis of the stakeholder-comprised
   management group of the SCSLF as a social-ecological action situation.
   This analysis is aided by the Institutional Analysis and Development
   (IAD) framework, a SES-imbedded tool used in our case to assess
   sustainability in resource management systems through critical analysis
   of stakeholder and resource system interactions. More generally, we find
   that research in lobster fisheries could benefit from broadening its
   scope of analysis, as overly narrow research foci have worked to limit
   the production of more holistic SES knowledge. Our exemplary analysis of
   the LAC's management of the SCSLF shows that the SES contains multiple
   components which have been associated with sustainable outcomes
   elsewhere; however, the fishery still faces many obstacles, including
   how to adapt to future challenges. Our results contribute to developing
   a holistic methodological approach for operationalizing SES framework
   research into practical fisheries management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Multilevel Resilience of Fishing Communities of Coastal Bangladesh
   Against Covid-19 Pandemic and 65-Day Fishing Ban},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The unusual situation that arose due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the
   65-day fishing ban (national policy to boost depleted fish stocks)
   affected the lower-income fishing communities in coastal Bangladesh.
   Shocks and stresses were posed, and community people adopted strategies
   to adapt to the changes. In the process of adaptation, social-ecological
   systems resilience at different levels plays a crucial role. Though
   resilience is acknowledged as multilevel feature, studies on the
   interaction between the levels while understanding communities'
   responses to shock and stress are limited. Thus, in this study, we
   explored the shocks and stresses the fishing community faced and their
   views on the resilience feature at different levels (i.e., individual,
   household, and community level) in coastal Bangladesh during the
   COVID-19 pandemic and 65-day fishing ban period. The study found that
   the most resilience promoting features (e.g., diversified livelihood,
   friendship, and network of supports) were adopted at the individual and
   household levels. However, positive and negative interactions were
   explored between resilience features at all levels. Low community-level
   resilience was not translated into a lack of household-level resilience,
   and strong individual-level resilience did not mean high household-level
   resilience. It was noted that the increased resilience of a particular
   individual or household could negatively affect community resilience.
   Resilience features showed inconsistent interactions within or among the
   three levels' resilience features. The study also revealed that
   multilevel resilience features stressed the importance of combining
   persistence (i.e., keeping fishing as the main livelihood) and
   adaptation process (e.g., livelihood diversification). The study
   showcases the importance of considering multilevel resilience that
   offers insight into crucial resilience factors which would not be
   evident if only one level were studied. The overall finding of this
   study will contribute to framing governance strategies to ensure
   sustainable coastal management even in the time of any abrupt or
   expected changes, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the fishing ban
   policy.},

Title = {Integrated and deliberative multidimensional assessment of a subtropical

Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {196},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {We investigate the operationalization of an integrated and deliberative
   multidimensional assessment (distribution of socioeconomic activities
   across marine spaces, risk to ecosystem levels, pressures on ecosystem
   services, and conflicts) in a Brazilian subtropical coastal-estuarine
   social-ecological system that is currently changing from a fragmented
   and sectoral governance system towards an ecosystem-based regime. Based
   on the perception of five direct ecosystem user groups (aquatic
   transport, tourism and recreation, mariculture, mining, and fisheries)
   we explored how the multidimensional assessment approach may inform
   ecologically coherent and socially equitable coastal governance and
   development. We conducted three cycles of participatory planning
   workshops (n = 39) with all groups: to map uses and activities across 7
   contextually different planning units; to identify conflicts; and to
   assess the spatial distribution of risks to the ecosystem. We mapped the
   spatial distribution of 28 activities that directly generate
   provisioning and cultural ecosystem services (ES), and their associated
   indirect impact-chains on all ESs types and affected users. A total of
   44 conflicts (32 inter- and 12 intra-sectoral) were discussed, and were
   higher in more intensely used areas. A habitat risk assessment scaled-up
   an ecosystem-level understanding of areas in need of urgent management.
   Important habitats (mangroves, submerged rocky outcrops, soft bottoms,
   water column) are facing high levels of risk; and a significant
   heterogeneity in spatial distribution of risk justifies radically
   alternative, contextually-based management and development measures to
   challenge the status quo. We conclude that the ecosystem services will
   likely continue to benefit present and future generations if an
   ecosystem-based management approach is consistently adopted with five
   sets of priorities: 1) advance plural valuation mechanisms with
   awareness of pressure-levels on the ecosystem; 2) manage conflicts while
   creating synergies amongst existing activities across space; 3) avoid
   expansion of pressure on ecologically sensitive areas; 4) consolidate
   the emerging novel democratic governance mechanism; and 5) explore the
   transferability approach's potential to scale-up coastal governance
   transformation in Brazil.},

   features to plan a marine protected area},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {40},
Pages = {116-131},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The definition of a common vision that includes social and environmental
   goals, ecosystem services and/or biodiversity features that people are
   interested in maintaining or restoring is a great challenge for marine
   protected areas (MPAs). Recent initiatives have promoted broadening the
   focus from biodiversity conservation alone to the conservation of both
   ecosystem services and biodiversity, indicating that this integration
   should improve support and compliance from stakeholders. Using a
   Multiple-Use Coastal Marine Protected Area recently proposed in northern
   Chile, we investigated (i) stakeholders' perceptions of the valuation of
   ecosystem services, threats to their provision, and the prioritization
   of ecosystem services, biodiversity features, and uses in a planning
   scenario, and (ii) stakeholders' expectations for the establishment of a
   new MPA. The perceptions of different groups of stakeholders were
   compared and statistically analyzed, and the relationships among
   prioritizations were studied using a network approach. Stakeholders
   identified and valued 13 ecosystem services, 28 biodiversity features,
   20 uses and activities, and 22 threats. Significant differences among
   the valuations and prioritizations of different stakeholder groups were
   attributable principally to artisanal fishermen's perceptions of some
   components that are directly related to their activities and
   livelihoods. High expectations of benefits from a new MPA implementation
   were observed for all categories of stakeholders. To relate the
   different valuated components, we proposed a network-based conceptual
   model that reduces complexity, and also as a strategy to communicate
   relationships and trade-offs occurring in this particular
   social-ecological system to the several stakeholders. We strongly
   recommend early stakeholder engagement so as to understand the
   variability in environmental perceptions and then reflect that variation
   in the planning and management actions of MPAs, thus improving support
   for their implementation and achieving conservation and societal goals.
   Our findings indicate that stakeholders' perceptions and prioritizadons
   of ecosystem services, biodiversity features and uses should be used as
   the basis for starting the MPA implementation and planning process. (C)

Title = {Community based aquaculture in the western Indian Ocean: challenges and
   opportunities for developing sustainable coastal livelihoods},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The small-fisheries social-ecological system in the western Indian Ocean
   (WIO) represents a typical social-ecological trap setting where very
   poor natural resources dependent coastal communities face local and
   global threats and engage in unsustainable practices of exploiting
   limited resources. Community-based aquaculture (CBA) has been
   implemented as an important alternative or supplementary income
   generating activity for minimizing the overdependence on marine natural
   resources and promoting biodiversity conservation. Despite its
   proliferation throughout the WIO region in recent decades, little is
   known about the degree to which CBA activities have contributed to
   achieving the objectives of breaking the cycle of poverty and
   environmental degradation and promoting community development and
   biodiversity conservation. In order to improve understanding of common
   challenges and to generate recommendations for best practice, we
   assessed the most common CBA activities practiced in the region through
   literature review and workshop discussion involving practitioners and
   key stakeholders. Findings indicated that despite favorable
   environmental conditions for various CBA practices, the sector remains
   underdeveloped, with few activities delivering the intended benefits for
   coastal livelihoods or conservation. Constraints included a shortage of
   seed and feed supplies, low investment, limited technical capacity and
   skills, insufficient political support, and lack of a clear strategy for
   aquaculture development. These are compounded by a lack of engagement of
   local stakeholders, with decision making often dominated by donors,
   development agencies, and private sector partners. Many of the region's
   CBA projects are designed along unrealistically short time frames,
   driven by donors rather than entrepreneurs, and so are unable to achieve
   financial sustainability, which limits the opportunity for capacity
   building and longer-term development. There is little or no monitoring
   on ecological and socioeconomic impacts. Except for a few isolated
   cases, links between CBA and marine conservation outcomes have rarely
   been demonstrated. Realizing the potential of CBA in contributing toward
   food security in the WIO will necessitate concerted investment and
   capacity strengthening to overcome these systemic challenges in the
   sector. Lessons herein offer managers, scientists, and policy advisors
   guidance on addressing the challenges faced in building strategic
   development initiatives around aquaculture in developing countries.},

Title = {Ocean health in the Northeast United States from 2005 to 2017},

Volume = {3},

Abstract = {People in the Northeast United States have a long history of benefitting
   from the ocean in many ways, exemplified by the region's important cod
   and lobster fisheries, coastal tourism and recent expansion of offshore
   energy. Over the past few decades, the region has become one of the
   fastest warming spots on the planet, has seen significant growth in
   coastal populations, and expansion of new sectors into the marine
   environment, resulting in ecosystem shifts and changes to the supply and
   distribution of these benefits. With these changes comes a need for
   measuring ocean health to understand how engagement with the ocean may
   be affected, and how regional management may need to adapt. To address
   this need, we tailored the Ocean Health Index framework to the U.S.
   Northeast region, scoring eight distinct goals for ocean health on a
   scale of 0 to 100 for 11 sub-regions over 13 years (2005-2017). All goal
   scores were averaged resulting in an Ocean Health Index score of 83 for
   the Northeast in 2017. This score fluctuated by 1 point in either
   direction (82-84) in the previous 12 years. The lowest scoring goals in
   2017 also exhibited the highest volatility since 2005, Food Provision
   (64) and Resource Access Opportunities (71). The region's highest goal
   scores came from Livelihoods \& Economies (99) and Biodiversity (90) and
   remained stable during the study period. Clean Waters scores had a
   steady, significant downward trend since 2005, while Resource Access
   Opportunities and Aquaculture show the largest improvements. This
   synthesis of over 50 datasets to create annual aggregate scores provides
   the public, government and non-government agencies with an easily
   digestible summary of how the region is faring in regards to ocean
   health. Perhaps even more importantly, this synthesis allows for the
   tracking of trends over time and the ability to quickly identify and
   prioritize low-scoring components of ocean health that could benefit
   from dedicated resources for improvement. As managers plan for the
   future in a changing Northeast marine region, the ability to track
   annual changes in ocean health and its respective components is key to
   making decisions that benefit the entire social-ecological system. A

Title = {Integrating multi-disciplinary data sources relating to inshore
   fisheries management via a Bayesian network},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {208},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {The move towards broader management of marine ecosystems has received
   significant momentum in recent years. Fundamental to Ecosystem-Based
   Management (EBM) and Ecosystem-Based Fisheries management (EBFM) is the
   need to engage relevant stakeholder groups. Here we present a Bayesian
   network (BN) tool developed to describe the snapper population in the
   Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand, and investigate possible outcomes of
   alternative management scenarios on snapper abundance. The Hauraki Gulf
   is a location where the marine environment is both highly valued and in
   high demand for the goods and services it provides. Snapper are a key
   component of this social-ecological system. We developed a BN focussed
   on key snapper life stages, and the consequences of stressors, including
   fishing, uses of marine space, land use practises (which influence
   sediment and nutrient yield), biogenic and environmental habitat
   variables, and upper level drivers such as climate change, human
   population growth and the global economy. Parameters were populated
   through a range of information types, from empirical and model analysis
   to literature review and expert opinion. Parameters for the core of the
   BN model (i.e. the snapper life stages and fishing methods) were
   adjusted so that the predicted effects of fishing reflected those seen
   in model projections from an age structured population model that had
   recently been used to inform the management of the snapper population in
   the Hauraki Gulf. The two most influential factors within this BN were
   fishing and land-use practises. Although there was a strong impact on
   snapper populations from land-use practises and resulting sedimentation
   that detrimentally affects biogenic habitats that juvenile snapper
   depend on, the potential impact of fishery extraction was much stronger.
   While fishery extraction of snapper is generally well managed, under the
   existing management set up it is also the only major stressor that would
   likely be regulated in response to decreases in the snapper population
   (regardless of the source of any impact). Engaging stakeholders to
   address issues such as this remains the greatest challenge facing
   EBFM/EBM in the Hauraki Gulf, but may be possible with tools such as the
   BN presented here.},

Title = {Do responsible fishing areas work? Comparing collective action
   challenges in three small-scale fisheries in Costa Rica},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {705-746},
Abstract = {Costa Rica is supporting Marine Areas of Responsible Fishing (AMPRs) to
   enable small-scale fishing communities to apply for exclusive harvesting
   and management rights within spatially delimited areas under a
   co-management policy framework. Communities need to self-organize their
   own fishing association and develop a fishing management plan (POP) to
   apply. Seven AMPRs have been established in the Gulf of Nicoya,
   highlighting Costa Rica's efforts to follow the FAO Small-Scale
   Fisheries Guidelines, but all face collective action challenges to
   develop and achieve common goals and implementation. In this article, we
   conduct a qualitative comparative analysis by applying the
   Social-Ecological System Framework (SESF) as a tool to identify the
   social and ecological conditions influencing collective action and
   co-management in three AMPRs in the Gulf of Nicoya, and we compare the
   similarities and differences between them. Our findings show that all
   three AMPRs face collective action challenges for different reasons.
   Nonetheless, some commonalities exist. Common drivers have motivated
   collective action in the creation of the AMPRs, including the desire to
   restrict certain types of fishing gears due to perceptions of resource
   scarcity and high dependence on local resources. Variables such as
   monitoring and sanctioning mechanisms, strong leadership and the
   economic heterogeneity of actors positively influence collective action
   in management. However, there are also variables hindering collective
   action, such as mistrust among actors, internal conflicts, lack of
   governmental support and resource unit mobility. Our findings suggest
   that AMPRs are a promising and potentially effective governance strategy
   because they can empower marginalized small-scale fishing communities
   and bring them into national development processes. However, there is an
   evident need for more state and local community investment into capacity
   building for self-organization and deliberation processes that can
   better enable AMPRs to move beyond ``paper parks{''}, and towards being
   a practically useful governance strategy to showcase Costa Rica's
   commitment to FAO Small-Scale Fisheries Guidelines. Adapting the AMPR
   model to fit the social-ecological context of each community is critical
   for success, despite the perceived similarity between the AMPRs.},

Title = {Historical declines in parrotfish on Belizean coral reefs linked to
   shifts in reef exploitation following European colonization},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {OCT 4},
Abstract = {Humans have utilized the Mesoamerican Reef (MAR) for millennia but the
   effects of prehistorical and historical fishing on this ecosystem remain
   understudied. To assess the long-term coupling of reef ecosystem and
   human dynamics in this region, we tracked trends in the structure and
   functioning of lagoonal reefs within the Belizean portion of the MAR
   using fish teeth fossils and sediment accumulation rates within reef
   sediment cores. We then paired this with a timeline of demographic and
   cultural changes in this region's human populations. The similar to
   1,300-year timeline encompassed in the core record shows that declines
   in the relative abundance and accumulation rate of teeth from
   parrotfish, a key reef herbivore, occurred at all three reef sites and
   began between similar to 1500 and 1800 AD depending on site and metric
   of abundance. A causality analysis showed that parrotfish relative
   abundance had a positive causal effect on reef accretion rates, a proxy
   of coral growth, reconfirming the important role of these fish in reef
   ecosystem functioning. The timing of initial declines in parrotfish
   teeth occurred during a time of relatively low human population density
   in Belize. However, declines were synchronous with cultural and
   demographic upheaval resulting from European colonization of the New
   World. The more recent declines at these sites (similar to 1800 AD)
   occurred in tandem with increased subsistence fishing on reefs by
   multiple immigrant groups, a pattern that was likely necessitated by the
   establishment of an import economy controlled by a small group of
   land-owning European elites. These long-term trends from the
   paleoecological record reveal that current parrotfish abundances in
   central Belize are well below their pre-European contact peaks and that
   increased fishing pressure on parrotfish post-contact has likely caused
   a decline in reef accretion rates. The origins of reef degradation in
   the Belizean portion of the MAR began hundreds of years before the onset

Abstract = {Recreational fisheries that use rod and reel (i.e., angling) operate
   around the globe in diverse freshwater and marine habitats, targeting
   many different gamefish species and engaging at least 220 million
   participants. The motivations for fishing vary extensively; whether
   anglers engage in catch-and-release or are harvest-oriented, there is
   strong potential for recreational fisheries to be conducted in a manner
   that is both responsible and sustainable. There are many examples of
   recreational fisheries that are well-managed where anglers, the angling
   industry and managers engage in responsible behaviours that both
   contribute to long-term sustainability of fish populations and the
   sector. Yet, recreational fisheries do not operate in a vacuum; fish
   populations face threats and stressors including harvest from other
   sectors as well as environmental change, a defining characteristic of
   the Anthropocene. We argue that the future of recreational fisheries and
   indeed many wild fish populations and aquatic ecosystems depends on
   having responsible and sustainable (R\&S) recreational fisheries whilst,
   where possible, addressing, or at least lobbying for increased awareness
   about the threats to recreational fisheries emanating from outside the
   sector (e.g., climate change). Here, we first consider how the concepts
   of R\&S intersect in the recreational fishing sector in an increasingly
   complex socio-cultural context. Next, we explore the role of the angler,
   angling industry and decision-makers in achieving R\&S fisheries. We
   extend this idea further by considering the consequences of a future
   without recreational fisheries (either because of failures related to
   R\&S) and explore a pertinent case study situated in Uttarakahand,
   India. Unlike other fisheries sectors where the number of participants
   is relatively small, recreational angling participants are numerous and
   widespread, such that if their actions are responsible, they have the
   potential to be a key voice for conservation and serve as a major force
   for good in the Anthropocene. What remains to be seen is whether this
   will be achieved, or if failure will occur to the point that
   recreational fisheries face increasing pressure to cease, as a result of
   external environmental threats, the environmental effects of
   recreational fishing and emerging ethical concerns about the welfare of
   angled fish.},

Title = {Social-ecological dimensions of Marine Protected Areas and coastal
   fishing: How fishermen's local ecological knowledge can inform fisheries
   management at the future ``Taza{''} MPA (Algeria, SW Mediterranean)},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {221},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to examine fishermen's Local Ecological
   Knowledge (LEK) relating to Marine Protected Area (MPA) planning and the
   overlap with fisheries management in the future ``Taza{''} MPA (Algeria,
   SW Mediterranean). The case study focuses on both commercial and
   recreational coastal fisheries from the fishing harbour of Ziama (NE
   Algeria). In this area, coastal fishing is carried out by professional
   small-scale fishers and purse seiners for commercial fishery and by
   recreational boat fishers for recreational fishery. While there have
   been some science-based studies in the characterization of this coastal
   fishery by using direct observation of landings as a method for
   estimating catch and fishing effort, fishermen's LEK remains
   under-utilized in this Social-Ecological System (SES). To address this
   knowledge gap, perceptions regarding: (1) biological and ecological
   impacts of coastal fisheries, (2) marine ecosystem health and (3)
   attitudes towards the proposed MPA regulations were analyzed in order to
   assess potential social-ecological impacts which can inform more
   accurately on MPA planning and fisheries management in the future. To
   this end, thirty face-to-face semi-structured interviews with fishers at
   Ziama harbour were carried out between June and September 2017. The
   study found that the future establishment of the ``Taza{''} MPA may
   affect the fisheries in this area in the short-term, and in particular
   the jobs and livelihoods of professional fishers by limiting the fishing
   area through new fishing restrictions. The fishermen's LEK provided some
   capacity to understand the heterogeneity of the SES in place and may be
   used as a tool to evaluate the outcome of fishery management actions.
   The results indicate higher acceptance rates among recreational than
   professional fishers regarding no-take zones. Professional fishers were
   proportionately more likely to oppose the new regulations, though 53\%
   of the fishers surveyed were uncertain about the future positive impacts
   of the MPA. The LEK provides managers with a level of detail about the
   prediction and prevention of fishermen opposition, and can point out
   opportunities for improving conservation policy with respect to social
   acceptance.},

Title = {Spatiotemporal relationships of threatened cetaceans and anthropogenic
   threats in the lower Yangtze system},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN CONSERVATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {3},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {The impacts of fisheries interactions on cetaceans can be challenging to
   determine, often requiring multiple complementary investigative
   approaches. The Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis
   asiaeorientalis), one of the few Critically Endangered cetaceans, is
   endemic to the middle-lower Yangtze drainage, a system impacted by
   multiple anthropogenic pressures. Bycatch mortality is implicated in
   regional porpoise decline, but the significance and dynamics of porpoise
   interactions with fishing activities and other threats remain poorly
   understood. We conducted boat-based surveys to map seasonal
   distributions and spatial congruence of porpoises and two potential
   threats (fishing and sand-mining), and an interview survey of fishing
   communities to understand temporal patterns and drivers of regional
   fishing activity, across Poyang Lake and the adjoining Yangtze mainstem.
   Variation in harmful and non-harmful gear use (non-fixed nets versus
   static pots and traps) between these landscapes might be an important
   factor affecting local porpoise status. Within Poyang Lake, spatial
   correlations between porpoises and threats were relatively weak,
   seasonal porpoise and threat hotspots were located in different regions,
   and two protected areas had higher porpoise encounter rates and
   densities than some unprotected sections. However, porpoise hotspots
   were mostly in unprotected areas, threats were widely observed across
   reserves, and more fishing and sand-mining was seasonally observed
   within reserves than within unprotected areas. Compared to null
   distributions, porpoises were detected significantly closer to fishing
   activities in summer and further from sand-mining in winter, indicating
   possible spatial risks of gear entanglement and disturbance. Reported
   porpoise bycatch deaths are associated with fixed and non-fixed nets,
   hook-based gears, and electrofishing. Longitudinal patterns in reported
   gear use indicate that hook-based fishing has decreased substantially
   and is generally conducted by older fishers, and significantly fewer
   respondents now practice fishing as their sole source of income, but
   electrofishing has increased. This combined research approach indicates
   a continued potential risk to porpoises from changing fisheries
   interactions and other threats, highlighting the importance of fishing
   restrictions and appropriate support for fishing communities impacted by
   this legislation. A potential ``win-win{''} for both biodiversity and
   local livelihoods could be achieved through wider use of static pots and
   traps, which are not associated with bycatch deaths.},

Title = {Fishery-Based Ecotourism in Developing Countries Can Enhance the
   Social-Ecological Resilience of Coastal Fishers-A Case Study of
   Bangladesh},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The importance of recreational fishing, in many coastal areas and less
   developed nations, is increasing rapidly. Connecting fisheries to
   tourism can create innovative tourism products and provide new income
   sources. The present study is the first to explore the concept of
   coastal fishery-based ecotourism (FbE) to enhance the social-ecological
   resilience of coastal fishing communities in a specific tourist spot in
   Bangladesh. A combination of primary (quantitative and qualitative) and
   secondary (literature databases) data sources were used in this study.
   It applied a social-ecological system (SES) and social-ecological
   resilience (SER) concept to collect quantitative and qualitative data
   (120 in-depth individual interviews, four focus group discussions, and
   strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats-SWOT analyses) and frame
   their interpretation. The study found that Bangladesh needs to adopt a
   firm policy to utilize tourism's potential in national economic
   development and societal progress. The findings show the considerable
   potential of the concept that integrates business, education, and an
   environmental conservation perspective in Bangladesh, specifically for
   Saint Martin's Island: 32\% of interviewees expressed that increasing
   employment opportunities and the Gross Domestic Products (GDP) is the
   primary potential, whereas 31\% said it would attract fishing tourists
   and 23\% believed it would develop the local infrastructure and
   facilities for fishing and tourism. Similarly, most of the respondents
   (31\%) thought that the lack of awareness and promotional activities is
   the main limitation preventing this initiative from being well accepted.
   Moreover, based on the findings, specific measures for strengthening the
   social-ecological resilience of the coastal fishers via FbE at the local
   level were suggested, including building communal links, developing
   community infrastructures, revising prevailing rules and regulations,
   offering alternative means of generating income for fishers during
   disaster periods, and more active sharing of responsibility between
   stakeholders and government for the management of FbE. Finally, with its
   focus on the prospects and challenges of coastal FbE development on
   Saint Martin's Island, this article provides a useful reference point
   for future discourse on similar social and economic strategies. While
   this study focuses on Bangladesh's coastal fishing villages, the results
   are possibly applicable more broadly in similar contexts and developing
   countries worldwide.},

Abstract = {Water from the Amudarya River is a vital and strategic resource for
   semi-arid Uzbekistan because of its heavy reliance on irrigated
   agriculture. The Uzbek water management regime, however, has proven to
   be rather reluctant to adapt to changing environmental and
   socio-political conditions despite recent massive pressures caused by
   political, environmental, or donor-induced developments in the region.
   The aim of this paper is to explore reasons for the low adaptability of
   the Uzbek water sector and assess implications for the resilience of the
   Uzbek social-ecological system (SES). By analyzing past losses of
   resilience as well as first attempts at institutional change in land and
   water management, we identify drivers as well as structural factors and
   mechanisms that act as barriers for adaptation and transformation
   towards a more sustainable system. With the collapse of the Aral Sea
   fisheries and the basin-wide large scale soil salinization, the SES in
   the Amudarya River Basin has shifted to a new, less desirable regime.
   However, the high resilience of the social system is keeping it in its
   current undesirable state and further degrades its long-term resilience.
   Our analysis identifies reinforcing feedbacks caused by ecological
   dynamics, vested interests, and a patronage system that contribute to
   the resistance to change and keep the system locked in its current
   unsustainable state. These factors are rooted in the history of the SES
   in the river basin, such as the economic dependence on cotton and the
   state-centered management approach. The window of opportunity for
   significant changes of the larger scale institutional setting that might
   have been open after the breakup of the Soviet Union was or could not be
   used to achieve a transformation to more sustainable resources use.
   Measures aimed at an incremental improvement of the current situation
   are not sufficient to prevent further losses of resilience. Resilience
   and transformability of the larger scale SES (political, economic, and
   institutional settings) are needed to enable the smaller scales
   (regional and local water management) to adapt and change. However, we
   identified opportunities for change arising from the slow acceptance of
   bottom-up management institutions in the water sector and from the
   extensive restoration capacity of the ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Many coastal communities depend on ecosystems for goods and services
   that contribute to human well-being. As long-standing interactions
   between people and nature are modified by global environmental change,
   dynamic and diversified livelihood strategies that enable seasonal
   adaptation will be critical for vulnerable coastal communities. However,
   the success of such strategies depends on a range of poorly understood
   influences. Gleaning, the hand-based collection of marine organisms from
   littoral habitats, provides an interesting case study of dynamic change
   in social-ecological interactions. It is an important coastal livelihood
   strategy, yet seasonal gleaning dynamics have not been empirically
   explored in contemporary communities. We examined seasonal gleaning in
   eight coastal communities on Atauro Island, Timor-Leste, using household
   surveys and satellite-derived maps of shallow-water benthic habitats.
   Our analysis explored the factors affecting household decisions to glean
   in each season, the relationship between gleaning and seafood
   consumption, and seasonal gleaning pressure on near-shore coastal
   resources. Dynamic marine harvesting strategies differed among
   households and gleaning activity was seasonally heterogeneous. Not all
   gleaning households gleaned during the season characterised by rough sea
   conditions despite rough season gleaning being associated with greater
   seafood consumption stability among seasons. Households also gleaned
   less regularly, and catches were smaller, in the rough season.
   Differences in seasonal participation in gleaning were explained mostly
   by type and extent of shallow habitat proximate to a community. In the
   calm season, household gleaning was positively related to the total area
   of shallow habitat, and in the rough season the percentage of
   hard-bottom shallow habitat was also an important predictor of gleaning
   activity. Our findings illustrate how changes in the biophysical
   environment mediate human-nature interactions at fine scales through
   time and space. Consequently, this research highlights the importance of
   context-specific perspectives for understanding drivers and dynamics in
   fishing pressure on littoral ecosystems, access to ecosystem benefits
   and limits to adaptation. Factors influencing when livelihood activities
   are feasible and desirable are important for evaluating the social
   impacts of climate change, particularly in the context of rural
   communities in the Global South.

Title = {Red and green loops help uncover missing feedbacks in a coral reef

Abstract = {Social-ecological systems (SES) exhibit complex cause-and-effect
   relationships. Capturing, interpreting, and responding to signals that
   indicate changes in ecosystems is key for sustainable management in SES.
   Breaks in this signal-response chain, when feedbacks are missing, will
   allow change to continue until a point when abrupt ecological surprises
   may occur. In these situations, societies and local ecosystems can often
   become uncoupled. In this paper, we demonstrate how the red loop-green
   loop (RL-GL) concept can be used to uncover missing feedbacks and to
   better understand past social-ecological dynamics. Reinstating these
   feedbacks in order to recouple the SES may ultimately create more
   sustainable systems on local scales. The RL-GL concept can uncover
   missing feedbacks through the characterization of SES dynamics along a
   spectrum of human resource dependence. Drawing on diverse qualitative
   and quantitative data sources, we classify SES dynamics throughout the
   history of Jamaican coral reefs along the RL-GL spectrum. We uncover
   missing feedbacks in red-loop and red-trap scenarios from around the
   year 600 until now. The Jamaican coral reef SES dynamics have moved
   between all four dynamic states described in the RL-GL concept: green
   loop, green trap, red loop and red trap. We then propose mechanisms to
   guide the current unsustainable red traps back to more sustainable green
   loops, involving mechanisms of seafood trade and ecological monitoring.
   By gradually moving away from seafood exports, Jamaica may be able to
   return to green-loop dynamics between the local society and their
   locally sourced seafood. We discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks
   of this proposed intervention and give indications of why an export ban
   may insure against future missing feedbacks and could prolong the
   sustainability of the Jamaican coral reef ecosystem. Our approach
   demonstrates how the RL-GL approach can uncover missing feedbacks in a
   coral reef SES, a way the concept has not been used before. We advocate
   for how the RL-GL concept in a feedback setting can be used to
   synthesize various types of data and to gain an understanding of past,
   present and future sustainability that can be applied in diverse
   social-ecological settings.

Title = {Fishers perceptions of ecosystem service change associated with

Abstract = {Understanding ecosystem service change necessitates an understanding of
   the social and ecological dimensions of ecosystem services and how they
   contribute to the well-being of different people. These empirical
   research gaps persist across the tropics and in coastal environments,
   posing a challenge for small island states that depend on ecosystem
   services associated with near-shore ecosystems like coral reefs.
   Perception-based approaches allow for a rapid appraisal of what
   constitutes ecosystem service change, providing insights into why these
   changes matter, and how experiences of change differ between
   individuals. To capture perceptions of change in four ecosystem services
   associated with coral reefs (habitat, fishery, coastal protection and
   recreation services), we conducted 41 semi-structured interviews with
   coral reef fishers from Seychelles, where reef ecosystems have been
   severely impacted by climate disturbance. We gathered quantitative and
   qualitative data to understand (a) if and what changes in
   reef-associated ecosystem services have been perceived; (b) if fishers'
   characteristics are associated with differences in perceived changes and
   (c) which changes matter most in fishers' lives. Using a
   three-dimensional approach to well-being, we sought to identify whether
   reasons behind the importance of change connect to fishers' well-being.
   There have been noticeable changes across all four ecosystem services
   investigated. Changes include social, ecological and behavioural
   dynamics. Every fisher perceived at least one ecosystem service change
   but fishers who dive/snorkel or work from larger boats perceived a
   higher number of ecosystem services to have changed. Education, age and
   participation in snorkelling/diving were associated with fishers who
   identified changing habitat services as most important, whereas fishers
   from families with fewer livelihood alternatives and from smaller
   islands identified changing fishery services as most important.
   Different aspects of the subjective, relational and material dimensions
   of well-being were implicated in why changing services matter.
   Despite known ecological shifts in reef condition, this research is one
   of few studies to empirically show how changes across multiple ecosystem
   services are being perceived. These perceived changes are complex,
   engage both the social and ecological dimensions of services, and
   connect in multiple ways to how fishers feel about their lives, their
   relationships and material well-being.

Title = {Managing social-ecological systems under uncertainty: implementation in
   the real world},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Management decisions for natural resources are not made in a vacuum; the
   environmental and ecological conditions as well as the socioeconomic and
   political contexts affect goals, the choice of interventions, their
   feasibility, and which outcomes are obtained. Although uncertainty is
   recognized as a feature of natural resource management, little attention
   has been given to the uncertainty generated by institutional settings,
   historical contingency, and individual people's influence. These
   implementation uncertainties, related to the translation of policy into
   practice, make it difficult to predict the outcomes of management
   interventions within social-ecological systems. Using the conservation
   of species hunted for bushmeat in the Serengeti as a case study, we
   investigated the challenges and potential barriers to successful
   implementation of natural resource management policies. We used a
   mixed-methods approach, combining semistructured interviews with
   scenario building, social network, and institutional analysis exercises.
   Using a management strategy evaluation (MSE) conceptual framework, we
   obtained insights into the constraints and opportunities for fulfilling
   stakeholder aspirations for the social-ecological system, analyzed the
   multiple roles played by different institutions in the system, and
   described the interactions between different actor types. We found that
   the respondents had generally similar views about the current and future
   status of the Serengeti but disagreed about how to address issues of
   conservation concern and were more uncertain about the actual outcomes
   of management interventions. Improving conservation implementation
   (rather than research, monitoring, or status assessment) was perceived
   as the key priority to be addressed. Institutional barriers were
   perceived as an important challenge given that the decision-making and
   implementation processes were broadly distributed across a number of
   institutions. Conservation social networks were centered on very few
   individuals, suggesting their importance in bridging across conservation
   arenas but also potentially affecting the resilience of governance
   structures. Our study gives an improved understanding of the underlying
   causes of discrepancies between conservation plans and outcomes for this
   case study, as well as providing a novel framework for the analysis of
   implementation uncertainties more broadly. A next step would be to use
   this framework as a basis for collaboratively developed models that
   integrate research findings with specific management questions. By
   bringing tools and findings from social psychology, natural resource
   management, and bioeconomics together into a unified operational
   framework, researchers may be better able to understand the barriers to
   successful resource management and engage with stakeholders to overcome
   them.},

Title = {Connecting a Trophic Model and Local Ecological Knowledge to Improve
   Fisheries Management: The Case of Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {MAR 22},
Abstract = {Trophic models of the Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) type and local
   ecological knowledge (LEK) have widely been applied to fisheries
   assessment and management. However, there are no specific methodologies
   describing how LEK from local fishers can be incorporated with the
   scientific data from the models in the context of ecosystem-based
   fisheries management. To our knowledge this is the first contribution
   exploring a systematic integration of LEK with EwE modeled output. An
   EwE food web model of the Nicoya Gulf ecosystem constructed 20 years ago
   and recently revisited by the authors and collaborators, was used in
   workshops to stimulate discussion among local stakeholders regarding
   changes in the marine ecosystem. For this study, 58 artisanal fishers
   were recruited to eight workshops. To assess the LEK, we documented the
   discussions, and the qualitative data were analyzed with quantitative
   frequency of responses to identify trends. Next, we systematically
   compared the changes in the fishery over time through an analysis of
   similar, complementary, and contradictory information across knowledge
   systems. In general, the analysis across systems reflected changes in
   species composition of the catches, paralleled by a harvest reduction in
   high-trophic-level species, as well as economic losses due to a shift in
   harvesting low-value species and due to an increase in operational
   costs. Particularly, we identified (1) similar pieces of information
   that delivered the same message, providing robust evidence of changes in
   the social-ecological system; (2) information complementary to each
   other, which together provided a broader picture (descriptors and
   attributes) of the changes of some fishing resources; and (3)
   conflicting pieces of information that indicated mismatches between
   sources of knowledge, which might suggest the cause of management
   problems. This study demonstrated how integrating knowledge systems can
   enhance our understanding of the state and changes in ecosystems,
   helping to improve fisheries management. We also found that an EwE model
   can be an effective communication tool to be used with fishers and to
   promote discussion and engagement. Our aspiration is to bring new and
   replicable tools to the policy interface in Latin-American fisheries,
   based on both stakeholder participation (including LEK) and the best
   scientific information available.},

Title = {Rainforest conservation in Mexico's lowland Maya area: Integrating local
   meanings of conservation and land-use dynamics},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {448},

Abstract = {In several tropical forested areas in which biodiversity conservation
   and indigenous cultures are interwoven, current conservation policies do
   not consider how the indigenous communities understand the concept of
   conservation that is promoted and implemented by conservation programs
   led by external actors, nor do they consider local traditional practices
   of resource management. To move towards more inclusive conservation
   policies that take these two aspects into account, research is required
   in indigenous settings that can inform policy makers. The present study,
   carried out in the lowland Maya area of Mexico, aims to investigate
   local meanings of rainforest conservation and dynamics of land use in
   two Maya common property holdings or `ejidos' (Noh cah and X-Maben). The
   study used a Social-Ecological Systems approach comprising: (i) the Maya
   communities and their local meanings of conservation as a Social
   Subsystem, assessed through social surveys, and (ii) the rainforest of
   each studied ejido - which was regarded as an Ecological Subsystem and
   assessed through satellite images (from 2000 to 2012). In the former,
   interviewees were asked: ``when you hear the phrase `conservation of the
   rainforest' what do you think is being said?{''} They were also asked if
   there were local words in Maya or Spanish that were similar in meaning
   to the aforementioned phrase. The results relating to the meanings of
   conservation demonstrate that Maya people, who rely on the rainforest
   for multiple livelihoods, understand two types of meanings for looking
   after the rainforest; one promoted by governmental conservation
   programs, and the other called Kanan K'aax, a Maya phrase that
   represents their customary or community-based rainforest conservation.
   Differences between these two models of conservation encompass
   differences with respect to scale, gender and the Maya people's own
   cultural practices. The results of the local dynamics of land use
   demonstrate that the landscapes of both study sites are dominated by
   mature rainforest (ranging from 73.9-82.7\%), and are therefore in a
   good state of conservation, and that their agricultural frontiers have
   not expanded. Our empirical results are valuable in terms of informing
   the scientific community about the state of rainforest conservation in
   the Maya Zone, and providing policy makers (from the Maya area and
   elsewhere) with information to devise new, more inclusive conservation
   policies that take full account of the indigenous cultural practices of
   rainforest management.},

Title = {Charting two centuries of transformation in a coastal social-ecological
   system: A mixed methods approach},

Abstract = {Oyster reef ecosystems used to form significant components of many
   temperate and subtropical inshore coastal systems but have suffered
   declines globally, with a concurrent loss of services. The early timing
   of many of these changes makes it difficult to determine restoration
   targets which consider interdecadal timeframes, community values and
   shifted baselines. On the Australian continent, however, the transition
   from Indigenous (Aboriginal) to Westernized resource use and management
   occurred relatively recently, allowing us to map social-ecological
   changes in detail. In this study, we reconstruct the transformations in
   the Sydney rock oyster (Saccostrea glomerata) wild commercial industry
   of central and southeast Queensland, and by extension its reef
   ecosystems, as well as the changing societal and cultural values related
   to the presence and use of the rock oyster through time. By integrating
   data from the archaeological, anthropological and fisheries literature,
   government and media accounts, we explore these transformations over the
   last two centuries. Before the 1870s, there was a relative equilibrium.
   Aboriginal peoples featured as sole traders to Europeans, supplying
   oysters and becoming a substantial component of the industry's labour
   pool. Effectively, Australia's commercial oyster industry arose from
   Aboriginal-European trade. During this initial phase, there was still a
   relative abundance of wild oyster, with subtidal oyster reef structures
   present in regions where oysters are today absent or scarce. By
   contrast, these reefs declined by the late 19th century, despite
   production of oysters increasing due to continued large-scale oyster
   recruitment and the expansion of oyster cultivation in intertidal areas.
   Production peaked in 1891, with successive peaks observed in regions
   further north. During the 1890s, flood events coupled with land-use
   changes introduced large quantities of silt into the system, which
   likely facilitated an increase in oyster pests and diseases, ultimately
   decreasing the carrying capacity of the system. Today oyster production
   in this region is less than one-tenth of historical peak production.
   Many cultural heritage components have also been lost. Indigenous
   management is now very minor due to the massive decimation of Aboriginal
   populations and their respective practices. Yet, we found strong
   cultural attachment to midden remains and oyster production continues
   within Indigenous communities, with considerable broader community
   support. This study highlights the value of conducting thorough analysis
   of early media accounts as a means for reconstructing historical
   resource decline and management. It further demonstrates the application
   of historical information and context for contemporary management,
   protection and restoration of much-altered coastal social-ecological
   systems.},

Title = {Uncovering water quality and evaluating vulnerabilities of small-scale
   fisheries in Chilika Lagoon, India},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 29},
Abstract = {Small-scale fisheries (SSFs) play a strong role in sustaining millions
   of livelihoods, food security, nutrition, and income globally but the
   fishers engaged in this sector simultaneously experience high levels of
   vulnerability and processes of marginalisation. Several factors are
   attributed to the multidimensional vulnerabilities the small-scale
   fishers experience, spanning both natural (e.g., natural disasters,
   ecosystem change) and anthropogenic (e.g., policy change, hydrological
   interventions, aquaculture) pressures. While there is much literature on
   various natural and human drivers of vulnerability in small-scale
   fishery communities, an absence of research connecting vulnerability
   with water quality is evident. Fisher communities often talk about fish
   in relation to the health of their aquatic habitats wherein water
   quality is seen as a key parameter. The link between healthy fish and
   good quality water has significant implications for strong and viable
   fishing communities. This paper examines these links further by focusing
   on the nature of vulnerabilities caused by water quality changes in the
   small-scale fishery system of Chilika Lagoon in India. We undertake
   detailed analysis of the invasive shrimp aquaculture activities and
   hydrological interventions for opening of a lagoon inlet with the Bay of
   Bengal as two dominant drivers adversely impacting water quality and
   increasing vulnerabilities of the entire small-scale fisheries
   social-ecological system. Our analysis suggests that there are strong
   interconnections between changes in water quality and the levels of
   vulnerabilities in the SSFs of Chilika Lagoon. Pollutants such as
   pesticides, and organic compounds accumulate in fish tissues and affect
   their growth, reproduction, and overall health. This led to declines in
   fish populations, making it more difficult for fishers to make a living.
   In addition to direct impacts on fish populations, poor water quality
   also has indirect effects on the social and economic vulnerability of
   SSFs. For example, contamination of water sources led to the reduced
   number of fish species reducing the amount of time fishers can spend on
   fishing activities. This also affected the marketability of fish
   products, reduced income and increased poverty. To fully understand the
   interconnections between water quality and vulnerability in SSFs in
   Chilika Lagoon, it is important to consider both environmental and
   social factors, as well as the complex feedback loops between these
   factors. The study helps in bridging a crucial gap in our understanding
   of the role of water quality in vulnerability analysis within resource
   dependent communities. We conclude with key insights on possible coping
   responses and adaptive capacity necessary for the small-scale fisheries
   communities to transition toward viability.},

Abstract = {Coastal Livelihood Sustainability Analysis (CLSA) concept is one form of
   SES (Social Ecological System) framework. CLSA is developed from the
   coastal and ocean resource management framework, where social structures
   are always linked to ecological or natural systems. The purpose of this
   research is to analyze the interaction or connectivity of the functional
   systematic relationship. This is based on humans always utilizing the
   ecological services of a functional system relationship. This CLSA
   approach is a systematic approach that is influenced by temporal spatial
   aspects. The interaction results of social and ecological systems can be
   seen from the existence of assets (human made capital), which is an
   aspect of the material resources used by humans to carry out activities.
   There are several types of human made capital, which are described as
   physical, human, economic and social assets. All these assets are
   necessary to achieve the objectives of resource sustainability. The
   sustainability of the livelihood management of migrant fishing
   communities, which have high livelihood vulnerabilities. The
   sustainability of livelihoods is supported by five major livelihood
   sources that will be enabled to develop life as a capital asset. The
   main sources of livelihood are the assets or natural capital, human
   capital, financial capital, physical capital and social capital. The
   success of sustainable livelihood is strongly influenced by the
   condition of all capitals that is how value of service flowing from
   stock of capital owned. CLSA in this research is the identification to
   livelihood assets of migrant fishermen at origin and destination area in
   migration activity. There are different condition between destination
   and an origin area of migration. This research can be improved of
   capital assets. By knowing the status of resources and capital assets of
   livelihood at Tanjung Luar and Salura, it can be determined alternative
   livelihoods. Alternative livelihoods can be created in order to improve
   the welfare of coastal communities. The method in this research is a
   survey research method. The analysis conducted is quantitative
   descriptive analysis using the CLSA framework of Emertoon. Stages and
   steps in the data analysis were to assess the status and owned of
   livelihood assets, that consists are natural resources assets, human
   assets, economic assets, social assets, and also physical assets. The
   result of this research is determined that Salura Island as a
   destination area only has the high of natural resources assets. This
   means that the main livelihood assets of the Salura Island are natural
   resources assets. Usually the assets of resources, human, financial,
   physical and social assets are mostly better in the destination area of
   migration, but the results of the research have determined that
   different with concept of migration. The result also shows that Salura
   Island as a migration destination with higher asset resource existence
   can be used as a source of livelihood by squid migrant fish to continue
   the sustainability of livelihood.},
