Title = {Regional social-ecological system coupling process from a water flow
   perspective},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {853},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {The social-ecological system is receiving more and more attention, and
   water resources have been a focal point for linking social systems and
   ecosystems, but how to clarify the regional social-ecological system
   coupling process through the water flow perspective and how to make
   ecosystem services management decisions still needs further re-search.
   This study integrates water quantity and quality and proposes a
   water-related ecosystem services flow frame-work. This study applied the
   framework to the Wuding River watershed and simulated water quantity and
   quality by SWAT model. The results showed that: (1) there is significant
   spatial heterogeneity in ecosystem service provisioning and meaningful
   improvement in water quality under the function of human-made capital in
   the green phase of the eco-system services flow; (2) in the red phase,
   beneficiaries use the water supply for their production and life and
   discharge >7400 tons pollution loads into the ecosystem; (3) in this
   process, human-made capital reduces about 35 \% of the am-monia
   pollution, and meanwhile, the ecosystem relies on its environment to
   further clean up about 44 \% of the load. The research framework is
   suitable for watershed social-ecological systems with simplistic
   interactions, guiding eco-logical compensation schemes and related
   management policies. Furthermore, providing a scientific basis for the
   sus-tainable use of regional water resources.},

Abstract = {This paper argues for a systemic-relational (SR) approach to

   to be effective and fair. This will require WRM to develop and
   internalise an ethically grounded approach. An SR approach holds that
   value with regard to the social-ecological system (SES) is to be
   primarily located, not at the level of its constituent components, but
   at the level of the SES as an integrated unit. The key principles
   informing the SR approach are spelled out, and its potential relevance
   to WRM is illustrated, using the key values operating within the WRM
   sector in South Africa as a case study.},

Abstract = {The Andean Tropics are among the mountain systems most affected by
   climate change. The most conspicuous effect is glacier recession.
   However, little is known about how rural populations perceive climatic
   change impacts or about how social-ecological systems respond to the
   effects of change. Here, I examine perceptions of climatic change and
   their effects on social-ecological systems in the Peruvian Southern
   Andes. Data from interviews and focus groups are used to explain
   institutional responses to climatic variability based upon perceived
   effects of climate change. Results show that people perceive glaciers
   shrinking, more frequent and intense extreme weather events, more
   extreme temperatures, and shortened rainy seasons. Their responses to
   these perceived changes range from wetland creation to agriculture
   calendar modification to irrigation adjustments. Such perceptions of
   change rely on personal observations and local knowledge, which inform
   responses; knowledge-based action characterizes resilient systems. This
   case study supports the conclusion that the resilience of
   social-ecological systems in the Peruvian Southern Andes is based upon
   local knowledge and institutions. Thus, strengthening institutions and
   fostering local knowledge renewal are crucial for systems'
   sustainability or transformation.},

Title = {Assessing adaptability of the water resource system to social-ecological

Abstract = {To optimize the overall layout of water resource allocation in the
   Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the adaptability of the water resource
   system to the regional social-ecological systems has to be enhanced.
   Based on the driver-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework,
   this study constructs an evaluation index system to analyze the
   adaptability mechanisms of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei' s water resource
   system according to the three major constituent social-ecological
   systems (i. e., economic, social, and ecological systems). Moreover, it
   adopts the technique of order preference similarity to the ideal
   solution (TOPSIS) to comprehensively evaluate the adaptability of
   Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei' s water resource system based on three
   constituent social-ecological systems (i. e., economic, social, and
   ecological systems) and identifies the spatiotemporal differentiation
   characteristics of the region. Our results showed that,. from 2000 to
   2020, the adaptability of Beijing-TianjinHebei' s water resource system,
   as a whole, significantly improved. In terms of stages, from 2000 to
   2007, the adaptability of the water resource social system was
   significantly higher than that of economic and ecological systems in the
   region. From 2008 to 2015, by accelerating the transformation and
   upgrading of industrial structures, improving the efficiency of economic
   water utilization, and strengthening the governance of the water
   ecosystem, the adaptability of water resource economic and ecological
   systems rapidly improved; however, that of the water resource ecological
   system was still the lowest. Additionally, the adaptability of the water
   resource economic system exceeded that of the social system. From 2016
   to 2020, the gap in adaptability of the water resource system to all
   three major constituent systems gradually narrowed. By 2020, the three
   systems entered a relatively balanced development stage, with the
   adaptability of the entire water resource system and the three major
   constituent systems maintaining a high level.. The economic system was
   significantly affected by per capita GDP, per capita water resources,
   and the efficiency of economic water utilization. Additionally, the
   social system was significantly affected by water consumption per unit
   of irrigation area. Meanwhile, the ecological system was significantly
   influenced by precipitation, water pollution discharge performance
   indicators, and the structure optimization indicators of water supply.
   According to the evaluation results, we propose countermeasures and
   provide recommendations to optimize the overall layout of water resource
   allocation and promote the coordinated management of water resources in
   the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {148},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Exploring the coupled and coordinated development of social-ecological
   systems is an important basis for promoting integrated watershed
   management. Based on the framework of the social-ecological system of
   lake water environment governance, this study builds an evaluation index
   system for quantifying the coupling and coordination of the
   social-ecological system, selects the representative key variables in
   each component of the socialecological system, and evaluates the
   coupling and coordination changes in the social-ecological system of
   Taihu lake water environment governance from 1987 to 2020. This study
   uses the coupling coordination degree model (CCDM) and the obstacle
   degree model (ODM) to reveal the dynamic relationship between the
   coupling degree (CD), the coupling coordination degree (CCD), and their
   obstacle factors of the social-ecological system of lake water
   environment governance. The results show that: (1) The comprehensive
   social system development level shows an uptrend, while ecological
   subsystem shows a decreasing and then increasing trend. With the
   development of social economy, water environment has experienced the
   process of deterioration followed by recovery. (2) CD and CCD both show
   a downward trend first and then an upward trend. CD ranges from 0.71 to
   0.98, its status had fluctuated between high-quality coupling stage and
   break-in stage. CCD ranges from 0.42 to 0.58, its status had fluctuated
   between near maladjustment recession and critical coordination stage.
   (3) The average obstacle degrees of the ecosystem and the social system
   are 0.51 and 0.49, the strong human activity interference in the social
   system and the vulnerability of the ecosystem and uncertainty jointly
   affects the CCD. Therefore, to improve the CCD of the social-ecological
   system of lake water environment governance, it is recommended that
   attention should be paid to the use and treatment of water resources in
   the process of social and economic development of the basin, and the
   amount of external pollution into the lake should be controlled in many
   ways. This study can help to understand the coupled social-ecological
   system interactions of Taihu lake water environment governance and
   provide a scientific basis for decision-makers.},

Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2024},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Mountains are social-ecological systems exposed to multiple climatic and
   socioeconomic drivers. The Pyrenees are a clear example of the
   concomitant challenges that these regions face, as they are exposed to
   stressors linked to depopulation, an economic shift towards tourism, and
   climate change. To understand how these multiple stressors affect the
   system's resources, it is useful to study them from a social-ecological
   system (SES) perspective. Focusing on a Pyrenean SES, we use piecewise
   structural equation modeling and network analysis to quantitatively
   describe the interactions between water resources, biodiversity, and the
   social and economic elements of the system. Our results show that the
   current economic focus and dependency on tourism severely impact water
   resources and biodiversity. Future climatic scenarios forecast a
   worsening of the pressures on the hydrological system and may threaten
   winter tourism. Actions to alleviate the pressures on water and
   biodiversity and to increase socioeconomic resilience are a priority. We
   argue that such actions will have to include both a diversification of
   the region's touristic offer and of the economy, coupled with a more
   sustainable use of water resources. Our findings highlight the
   importance of studying the interactions and causal relationships between
   SES elements. This can help gain a comprehensive understanding of how
   the SES functions and its sustainability challenges.},

Abstract = {Transboundary water resources, such as international river basins, pose
   complex and often contentious management challenges. In response to the
   failures associated with the state-centric approach to the governance of
   international waters, discussions on transboundary water resources
   governance over the last two decades or so have focused largely on
   public involvement. The need to build resilience into such governance
   systems has been virtually overlooked. Based on a conceptualization of
   transboundary water resources as complex social-ecological systems, the
   manuscript proposes adaptive governance as a unifying framework for
   informing policies aimed at promoting the conservation of transboundary
   water resources in an increasingly unpredictable future. The key
   attributes of adaptive governance satisfy the requirements for good
   governance of transboundary water resources, as well as preparing the
   coupled social-ecological system to respond to unpredictable drivers of
   change.},

Abstract = {Formal models used to study the resilience of social-ecological systems
   have not explicitly included important structural characteristics of
   this type of system. In this paper, we propose a network perspective for
   social-ecological systems that enables us to better focus on the
   structure of interactions between identifiable components of the system.
   This network perspective might be useful for developing formal models
   and comparing case studies of social-ecological systems. Based on an
   analysis of the case studies in this special issue, we identify three
   types of social-ecological networks: ( 1) ecosystems that are connected
   by people through flows of information or materials, ( 2) ecosystem
   networks that are disconnected and fragmented by the actions of people,
   and ( 3) artificial ecological networks created by people, such as
   irrigation systems. Each of these three archytypal social-ecological
   networks faces different problems that influence its resilience as it
   responds to the addition or removal of connections that affect its
   coordination or the diffusion of system attributes such as information
   or disease.},

Title = {Scale mismatch in social-ecological systems: a Costa Rican case study of
   spring water management},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAY 20},
Abstract = {In the management of natural resources, scale mismatch occurs when
   resources are not managed at the spatial or temporal scale at which they
   are provisioned. Issues of scale mismatch abound in social-ecological
   systems and can hinder efforts to effectively manage resources, threaten
   the resilience of the larger ecosystem, and affect societal well-being
   and livelihoods. Here, we provide a brief overview of the scale mismatch
   literature and discuss potential opportunities to address scale
   mismatches in drinking water management. We present a case study of
   spring water management in rural communities in the Cartago province of
   Costa Rica, where community groups face issues of both spatial and
   temporal mismatch in providing drinking water to their users. Through
   this case study, we observed that issues of scale mismatch are often
   overlooked because of a lack of understanding of the scale at which
   resources are sustained. We argue that highlighting examples of scale
   mismatch will help others to identify and understand their own systems
   and be better prepared to reconfigure operations to govern and manage
   social-ecological systems. Given the dynamic, adaptive nature of
   social-ecological systems, scale dependencies can change in a system.
   Thus, we recommend periodic scale mismatch analysis in these systems.},

Abstract = {This paper is a social-ecological systems (SES) analysis of tourism and
   water inequity in Bali. It uses Elinor Ostrom's SES model to look at the
   particular niche of Bali's tourism and water nexus. Re-analysis of
   previous qualitative research revealed that the vulnerability of the SES
   was due to numerous characteristics. In particular, user groups are
   highly diverse, transient and stratified, thereby inhibiting
   communication and knowledge sharing. This, in combination with weak
   governance systems and the economic power of the tourism industry,
   interact to affect declining water resources and the iniquitous impact
   of this. Whilst there are obvious indications that Bali's water
   resources are over stretched, there is no feedback loop to the
   institutional structures that would help enable appropriate responses
   from the user groups or governance system.},

Title = {The robustness mechanism of the rural social-ecological system in
   response to the impact of urbanization--Evidence from irrigation commons
   in China},
Journal = {WORLD DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {178},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Urbanization is essential for achieving rapid development. In this
   process, the labor outmigration from rural areas to cities caused by
   urbanization has diversified the impacts on the robustness of the rural
   social-ecological system. However, existing research has rarely
   discussed the internal mechanism of the response of the rural
   social-ecological system to the impact of urbanization. Based on the
   coupled infrastructure systems framework, in this paper, the internal
   interactions of the rural social-ecological system responding to the
   impact of urbanization are discussed. An empirical test is conducted
   using survey data from 123 villages of 14 Chinese provinces. Focusing on
   the specific practice of China, this paper further discusses how the
   robustness of the rural socialecological system can be ensured under
   external impact. The main conclusions are as follows: under the impact
   of urbanization, the internal interaction paths with which the rural
   social-ecological system maintains robustness at the operational level
   are not unique. These different internal interaction paths may not only
   make the rural social-ecological system automatically realize a virtuous
   and robust cycle under the impact of urbanization, they may also cause a
   gradual collapse of the rural social-ecological system. Further, the
   discussion of China's specific practice shows that it is key to provide
   institutional rules to guarantee the operational processes through the
   collective-choice process, thus ensuring the robustness of the rural
   social-ecological system under the impact of urbanization. The
   inspection of the interaction mechanisms in this study may obtain some
   restricted views on the general laws that may be contained in the
   complex interaction within the rural social-ecological system, and
   provide a theoretical basis developing countries can apply to realize
   rural revitalization when faced with the irreversible wave of
   urbanization.},

   practitioner approaches to water resources development, chiefly
   integrated water resources management (IWRM). This paper bridges the gap
   between research and practice through a novel application of the
   social-ecological systems framework to a set of 10 conflict cases from
   an IWRM initiative in rural Central America. The conflicts in the
   empirical cases are found to be primarily the result of socio-political
   variables, particularly low levels of trust and social capital, and
   peacebuilding is suggested as a promising approach to address this suite
   of conflicts. The paper concludes with a proposed course of research
   designed to further both theoretical and applied knowledge of water

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {584},
Pages = {673-682},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {This study makes a first attempt to operationalize the safe operating
   space concept at a regional scale by considering the complex dynamics
   (e.g. non-linearity, feedbacks, and interactions) within a systems
   dynamic model (SD). We employ the model to explore eight `what if'
   scenarios based on well-known challenges (e.g. climate change) and
   current policy debates (e.g. subsidy withdrawal). The findings show that
   the social-ecological system in the Bangladesh delta may move beyond a
   safe operating space when a withdrawal of a 50\% subsidy for agriculture
   is combined with the effects of a 2 degrees C temperature increase and
   sea level rise. Further reductions in upstream river discharge in the
   Ganges would push the system towards a dangerous zone once a 3.5 degrees
   C temperature increase was reached. The social-ecological system in
   Bangladesh delta may be operated within a safe space by: 1) managing
   feedback (e.g. by reducing production costs) and the slow biophysical
   variables (e.g. temperature, rainfall) to increase the long-term
   resilience, 2) negotiating for transboundasy water resources, and 3)
   revising global policies (e.g. withdrawal of subsidy) that negatively
   impact at regional scales. This study demonstrates how the concepts of
   tipping points, limits to adaptations, and boundaries for sustainable
   development may be defined in real world social-ecological systems. (C)

Abstract = {Some social-ecological systems (SESs) have persisted for hundreds of
   years, remaining in particular configurations that have withstood a
   variety of natural and social disturbances. Many of these long-lived
   SESs have adapted their institutions to the particular pattern of
   variability they have experienced over time as well as to the broader
   economic, political, and social system in which they are located. Such
   adaptations alter resource use patterns in time and/or space to maintain
   the configuration of the SESs. Even well-adapted SESs, however, can
   become vulnerable to new types of disturbances. Through the analysis of
   a series of case studies, we begin to characterize different types of
   adaptations to particular types of variability and explore
   vulnerabilities that may emerge as a result of this adaptive process.
   Understanding such vulnerabilities may be critical if our interest is to
   contribute to the future adaptations of SESs as the more rapid processes
   of globalization unfold.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Agricultural watersheds are affected by changes in climate, land use,
   agricultural practices, and human demand for energy, food, and water
   resources. In this context, we analyzed the agricultural, urbanizing
   Yahara watershed ( size: 1345 km(2), population: 372,000) to assess its
   responses to multiple changing drivers. We measured recent trends in
   land use/cover and water quality of the watershed, spatial patterns of
   10 ecosystem services, and spatial patterns and nestedness of
   governance. We developed scenarios for the future of the Yahara
   watershed by integrating trends and events from the global scenarios
   literature, perspectives of stakeholders, and models of biophysical
   drivers and ecosystem services. Four qualitative scenarios were created
   to explore plausible trajectories to the year 2070 in the watershed's
   social-ecological system under different regimes: no action on
   environmental trends, accelerated technological development, strong
   intervention by government, and shifting values toward sustainability.
   Quantitative time-series for 2010-2070 were developed for weather and
   land use/cover during each scenario as inputs to model changes in
   ecosystem services. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how changes in
   the social-ecological system of the Yahara watershed, including
   management of land and water resources, can build or impair resilience
   to shifting drivers, including climate.},

Journal = {SOCIETY \& NATURAL RESOURCES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1-3},
Pages = {141-155},
Abstract = {Current research in coupled social-ecological systems (SESs) often draws
   on theories of complex adaptive systems, resilience, and robustness.
   Many studies analyze the resilience, robustness, or vulnerability of
   these systems to disturbances and siressors, but do not connect their
   particular case with a general notion of what counts as a disturbance.
   This makes theoretical generalization of how outcomes are coproduced by
   disturbances and SESs difficult. These outcomes, in turn, serve as an
   entry point to represent SESs as dynamic systems that evolve and change
   over time. This study proceeds by first building a typology of
   disturbances to facilitate a better understanding of
   disturbance-response dyads in an SES. It then introduces a simple
   framework for analyzing SESs over time. Finally, the article applies
   this framework to case studies drawing on previous fieldwork.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Much is known about collective action in the commons but little is known
   about the effects of migration as an exogenous shock. We study the case
   of China where at least 280 million people have migrated from the rural
   areas to the cities over the last four decades. We apply the
   social-ecological system (SES) framework along with the theory of
   collective action using survey data from 1985 households in 20 provinces
   throughout China. Data was analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis,
   ordered probit regression with instrumental variables, structural
   equation modeling, and interaction effects analysis. We find that
   migration exerts a significant negative effect on collective action in
   the commons and its effect is mediated by four mechanisms: resource
   dependence, leadership, social capital, and sense of community. Of
   these, resource dependence and leadership account for about two-thirds
   of the total effect. The SES framework has been shown to be a useful
   tool for empirically studying complex, multi-variable, nonlinear,
   cross-scale, and dynamic social-ecological systems.},

Abstract = {The resilience perspective, which emphasizes the integrated, systemic
   concept of human and nature interactions, is increasingly used as an
   approach for understanding the dynamic of social-ecological system. As
   the water resources system (WRS) is a social-ecological system,
   resilience thinking such as Holling's adaptive cycle has been adopted as
   a fundamental unit for understanding the water resources system dynamics
   in this paper. In the adaptive cycle of WRS, the likelihood shift among
   different phases largely depends on resilience value; and a quantitative
   method for estimating the resilience of WRS is proposed. The method is
   related to the degree of change and characteristics of the WRS, and has
   been applied to identify the phase of WRS in every city in Zhejiang
   province, China. The results of resilience assessment have also been
   discussed in terms of adaptive cycle.},

Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-22},
Abstract = {The object of this article is the drinking water infrastructure (DWI), a
   critical societal infrastructure. To make effective decisions it is
   important to characterise and understand the complexity of DWI systems.
   DWI systems can be seen as a system of systems, consisting of the
   social-ecological system and the social-technical system. The
   social-ecological system determines the location and seize of the water
   resources, while the social-technical system is about the technical
   infrastructure. The two systems with different characteristics must
   align to work effective together in the DWI system. The tension between
   different lifecycles of the assets and dynamic changes in both systems,
   the time of change, is important to take into account. The SoPhyTech
   infra framework was developed based on the two systems and time of
   change. The advantages of applying the SoPhyTech infra framework is
   studied in a case comparing two very different DWI systems: Indonesia
   (Semarang) and the Netherlands (Vitens). The SoPhyTech infra framework
   was shown to be effective for characterising a DWI system with different
   interacting lifecycles in different systems and it is expected that it
   also can be used to characterise other infrastructure systems.},

   However, the understanding of these indirect conflict impacts in
   different social and political contexts is still limited. In order to
   address this knowledge gap, we build on the social-ecological systems
   framework to differentiate between direct and indirect conflict impacts
   and to analyze their effects on the water system. We then apply the
   framework to map direct and indirect impacts of armed conflict on water
   resources management, using empirical data from eleven cases in Iraq,
   Syria, Palestine and Yemen. This allows us to identify pathways in which
   conflict impacts are propagated through the water system. The results
   show the central role of financial mechanisms in upholding water
   resources management throughout conflict and the importance of enforcing
   international humanitarian law on the protection of civilian
   infrastructure. They also highlight the value of system-based approaches
   in revealing cumulative effects that can reinforce conflict impacts
   within the system, and in identifying potential obstacles for coping
   strategies employed by local populations throughout the conflict.},

Title = {The impacts of land fragmentation on irrigation collective action:
   Empirical test of the social-ecological system framework in China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {78},
Pages = {234-244},
Abstract = {Land fragmentation is an interesting physical character in some
   developing countries, especially China. This study aims to discover the
   direct and mediated effects of land fragmentation on collective action
   in China based on an empirical test and the social-ecological system
   framework. We introduce three innovations to the literature on
   collective action in the commons. First, we focus on the mechanism of
   land fragmentation on collective action in the commons, which has been
   largely ignored in the literature. Second, building on the
   social-ecological system framework, we use structural equation modeling,
   which is robust to endogeneity and latent variable problems. Third, we
   use original survey data from 3895 households and 284 villages from 17
   provinces/regions in China, a critical case because China has some of
   the most fragmented farmland use in the world. We find that land
   fragmentation has a direct negative effect on irrigation collective
   action. And besides the direct negative effect, there are four indirect
   factors: dependency on farming, irrigation rule-making, economic
   pressure and land circulation. Of these, the first three have a negative
   effect, and the last one, a positive effect. Our findings add to the
   theoretical literature on collective action in the commons and suggest
   new policy handles for more efficient land and labor markets in China.},

Title = {Assessing Impacts From Climate Change on Local Social-ecological Systems
   in Contexts Where Information is Lacking: An Expert Elicitation in the
   Bolivian Altiplano},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {137},
Pages = {70-82},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Assessment of the expected impacts from climate change is an essential
   input for agencies engaged in fostering adaptation of local
   social-ecological systems. However, data is seldom available at the
   required scale. This study overcomes this hurdle by gathering data via
   an expert elicitation protocol. We report experts' judgements about two
   topics: i) the impacts from climate change on crop yields in three
   communities located in the Bolivian Altiplano; and ii) the effectiveness
   of specific irrigation techniques in mitigating the impacts from climate
   change in the communities under study. Our gathered data allow us to
   document heterogeneity of expected impacts across communities with one
   community expected to experience an increase in yields under wet climate
   change scenarios. Experts judge irrigation as an effective mitigation
   tool under most of the dry climate change scenarios presented to them.
   We believe that our data collection strategy represents a promising
   decision support tool for a wide range of public policy issues.
   Particularly, when monetary and time constraints converge with the lack
   of scientific information. In addition, the information gathered with
   this methodology can be incorporated into participatory methodologies
   gathering information from local social-ecological systems. (C) 2017

Abstract = {Governance of social-ecological systems is a major policy problem of the

   these two critical variables identified in field research. Previous
   behavioral experiments of commons dilemmas have found that people are
   willing to engage in costly punishment, frequently generating increases
   in gross benefits, contrary to game-theoretical predictions based on a
   static pay-off function. Results in our experimental environment find
   that costly punishment is again used but lacks a gross positive effect
   on resource harvesting unless combined with communication. These
   findings illustrate the importance of careful generalization from the

Title = {The Roles of Adaptive Water Governance in Enhancing the Transition
   towards Ecosystem-Based Adaptation},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The growing realization of the inadequacies of the conventional approach
   to climate change adaptation has generated interest in sustainable forms
   of adaptation that could promote long-term ecosystem health and social
   equity. In this regard, the concept of ecosystem-based adaptation has
   been receiving attention as an integrative framework for maintaining
   healthy ecosystems, with the aim of building the resilience and reducing
   the vulnerability of social-ecological systems to climate change
   impacts. However, there is currently an inadequate understanding of the
   institutional requirements for the transition towards ecosystem-based
   adaptation. A promising institutional mechanism for addressing these
   governance challenges is adaptive governance, a governance mechanism
   that relies on flexible, multi-level institutions to connect actors
   across multiple scales in managing conflicting values and uncertainties
   in ecosystem-based management processes. This paper discusses four roles
   of adaptive governance in the transition of water resource systems
   towards ecosystem-based adaptation: (1) creating awareness about climate
   change through social learning and the integration of diverse sources of
   knowledge; (2) generating interest for policy change through the
   provision of economic and non-economic incentives; (3) creating
   opportunities for change through the promotion of vertical and
   horizontal interactions among actors; and (4) building capacities for
   change through enhanced access to relevant institutions and resources.},

Title = {Adoption and shift of water-saving strategies to policy shock: based on
   social-ecological system analysis},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {10},
Pages = {4015-4037},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Water scarcity is a global issue due to climate change and increasing
   water demand. Water pricing policy is a critical instrument to stimulate
   farmers' water-saving actions. Different types of water-saving behaviors
   are closely related and interactional. It is thus necessary to study
   multiple water-saving behaviors together and their dynamic
   transformation with intensification of policy shock. Besides, whether
   the policy could work well depends much on the social-ecological system
   where farmers are embedded. This paper studies how social-ecological
   system impacts farmers' choice from multiple water-saving strategies and
   their shift of response strategies with further increase in water price.
   A field survey was conducted in semi-arid area of northwestern China
   that has suffered from severe water shortage and human-land conflicts
   for a long time. The results show that adoption of active-negative
   strategy rather than passive water-saving strategy is affected by
   productivity and predictability of resource system, number of users,
   norms, social capital, and collective choice rules. Adoption of
   active-positive strategy depends much on relative size and productivity
   of resource system, predictability of system dynamics, mobility of
   resource units, number of users, norms, social capital, and monitoring
   and sanctioning process. However, their effects have disparities, or are
   even opposite under different intensities of policy shock. When policy
   shock intensifies, mobility of resource units, number of users, resource
   importance, and monitoring and sanctioning process are identified as key
   factors to degrade farmers' water-saving strategy rather than maintain
   their original strategy. Both the size of resource system and the
   quality of social network promote farmers to upgrade response strategy.
   The results indicate that there is a complicated relationship between
   policy shock and water-saving responses in the framework of
   social-ecological system, explained by a series of mechanisms. The
   findings provide valuable implications for optimizing water pricing
   mechanism, designing targeted measures, and developing effective
   governance environment.},

Title = {Quantifying the effects of institutional shifts on water governance in
   the Yellow River Basin: A social-ecological system perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {629},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Water governance in river basins worldwide faces challenges due to
   complex socio-economic and environmental factors. In the Yellow River
   Basin (YRB), two major institutional shifts, the 1987 Water Allocation
   Scheme (87-WAS) and the 1998 Unified Basin Regulation (98-UBR), aimed to
   address water allocation and usage issues. This study quantifies the net
   effects of these institutional shifts on water use within the YRB and
   analyzes the underlying reasons for their success or failure. We employ
   a Differenced Synthetic Control method to assess the impacts of the
   institutional shifts. Our analysis suggests that the 87-WAS unexpectedly
   increased water use by 5.75\%, while the 98-UBR successfully reduced
   water use as anticipated. Our research highlights the role of
   institutional structures in governance policies, demonstrating that the
   mismatched structure of the 87-WAS led to increased competition and
   exploitation of water resources, while the 98-UBR, basin-wide authority
   and stronger connections between stakeholders, resulted in improved
   water governance. Our study underscores the importance of designing
   institutions that are consistent with the scale of the ecological
   system, promote cooperation among stakeholders, and adapt to changing
   social-ecological system (SES) contexts. As outdated and inflexible
   water quotas may no longer meet the demands of sustainable development
   in the YRB, policymakers must consider the potential consequences of
   institutional shifts and their impact on water use and sustainability.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we frame the problem of urban water sustainability in
   megacities as a social-ecological system (SES) to examine the underlying
   coupling of social and ecological factors and processes. Based on our
   empirical research of two major megacities of the global south, SAo
   Paulo and Delhi, we have developed an urban water SES module within the
   broader SES framework proposed by Ostrom. The module's multilevel nested
   structure consists of the following four subsystems: water resource and
   infrastructure, settlements, governance, and actors. A distinct
   advantage of our module is that it enables us to capture the plurality
   of settlements patterns (from formal to informal settlements), actor
   networks, and governance patterns found in cities of the global south
   and how these uniquely shape and are shaped by the process of rapid
   urbanization. We use this module as: (a) an analytical tool to identify
   the different variables and processes within each subsystem, which
   through their interactions, have influenced the trajectory of water
   systems in these cities; (b) a diagnostic tool in a comparative setting
   to examine why desired goals in terms of service delivery and/or
   governance were achieved (or not); and (c) a prescriptive tool to
   identify cross-learnings and practical lessons.},

Abstract = {Groundwater resources are essential for the supply of drinking water in
   the European Union but significant uncertainties surround their quality.
   In this context, our article analyzes the factors that influence the
   cooperation of key stakeholders to prevent the risk of diffuse pollution
   from agriculture. We built on the institutional rational choice approach
   and the social-ecological system framework to design our analytical
   framework and hypotheses. We applied this analytical framework to two
   cases of cooperation involving drinking water suppliers and farmers in
   the management of the risk of non-point source pollution from
   agriculture in France. Our results show that cooperation emerges when
   the water resource is important for water suppliers to take on the
   leadership. Our results also characterize the role played by
   uncertainties and risk in getting stakeholders involved, and finally,
   suggest that cooperation depends on the size and predictability of the
   resource system.},

Booktitle = {LANDSCAPE DYNAMICS, SOILS AND HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES IN VARIED CLIMATES},
Series = {Springer Geography},
Year = {2016},
Pages = {741-762},
Abstract = {Lessons learned from the failure of rational-comprehensive planning
   approaches to the management of water and other natural resources have
   led to a rethinking of the nature of resource management problems. The
   concept of wicked problems is increasingly used to describe problems
   that lack consensus in terms of their definition and solutions. In line
   with the ongoing search for appropriate conceptual frameworks and
   institutions for managing wicked problems, this chapter argues for a
   reconceptualization of wicked problems as complex social-ecological
   systems. Such a reconceptualization calls for a resilience-based
   approach to managing wicked problems through adaptive governance
   institutions. Adaptive governance provides a multi-level institutional
   framework for managing the uncertainties and conflicts that characterize
   wicked environmental problems. This argument is illustrated using the
   case of the Cache River watershed in southern Illinois, USA.},

Abstract = {This paper applies a social-ecological system (SES) framework to the
   analysis of a SES in the Taos valley of northern New Mexico. The SES
   analyzed is a set of interconnected irrigation communities known as
   acequias. These have persisted in the area for several hundred years. In
   this paper I combine concepts from multi-level governance, social
   network analysis, and interconnected action situations to diagnose the
   factors that have enabled the acequias to maintain the levels of
   cooperation needed to persist as farming communities in a high desert
   environment. To conduct this research, interview data were collected
   on-site to complement existing court testimonies and other relevant
   primary and secondary data. These data were analyzed via a step-wise
   diagnostic process that is inspired by the SES framework and used to
   illustrate how the acequias form a multilevel governance system via key
   network attributes, and how this governance structure maps onto the
   resource system while not overburdening the participants and providing
   sufficient benefits to motivate continued cooperation over time.},

Abstract = {Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) is gaining increased
   acceptance among water policy makers and researchers as a way to create
   more effective governance institutions, leading towards integrated water
   development solutions for poverty alleviation, while addressing social,
   economic and environmental aspects of water challenges. However, global
   environmental change poses fundamental challenges to water policy makers
   as it implies vast scientific, and hence, policy uncertainty; its
   implications for international water governance initiatives remain
   unspecified, effectively hindering dialogue on how current IWRM
   initiatives should be modified. This paper addresses the lag between our
   growing understanding of resilient interconnected freshwater resources
   (and their governance) and the reforms being promoted by policy makers.
   In particular, there is a need to rethink some of IWRM's key components
   to better tackle the challenges posed by the complex behaviour of
   interconnected social-ecological systems and global environmental
   change.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Scenario analysis is a useful tool to facilitate discussions about the
   main trends of future change and to promote the understanding of global
   environmental changes implications on relevant aspects of
   sustainability. In this paper, we reviewed 294 articles published
   between 1995-2019, to evaluate the state of the art use of models and
   scenarios to investigate the effects of land use change and climate
   change on natural and social-ecological systems. Our review focuses on
   three issues. The first explores the extent to which the environmental
   dynamics of land use and climate change were jointly analyzed and the
   spatial scales associated with such integrated studies. The second
   explores the modelling methodologies and approaches used in the scenario
   analysis. The third explores the methods for developing or building
   scenarios. Results show that in most predictions there is little
   integration of key drivers of change. We find most forecasting studies
   use a sectoral modelling approach through dynamic spatially distributed
   models. Most articles do not apply a participatory approach in the
   development of scenarios. Based on this review, we conclude that there
   are some gaps in how scenario analysis on natural and social-ecological
   systems are conducted. These gaps pose a challenge for the use of models
   and scenarios as predictive tools in decision-making processes in the
   context of global change.},

Title = {Developing Adaptive Capacity to Droughts: the Rationality of Locality},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The Bear River is driven by a highly variable, snow-driven montane
   ecosystem and flows through a drought-prone arid region of the western
   United States. It traverses three states, is diverted to store water in
   an ecologically unique natural lake, Bear Lake, and empties into the
   Great Salt Lake at the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge (BRMBR). People
   in the Bear River Basin have come to anticipate droughts, building a
   legal, institutional, and engineered infrastructure to adapt to the
   watershed's hydrologic realities and historical legacies. Their ways of
   understanding linked vulnerabilities has led to what might appear as
   paradoxical outcomes: farmers with the most legally secure water rights
   are the most vulnerable to severe drought; managers at the federal Bear
   River Migratory Bird Refuge engage in wetland farming and make unlikely
   political alliances; and, increased agricultural irrigation efficiency
   in the Bear River Basin actually threatens the water supply of some
   wetlands. The rationality of locality is the key to understanding how
   people in the Bear River Basin have increased their adaptive capacity to
   droughts by recognizing their interdependencies. As the effects of
   climate change unfold, understanding social-ecological system linkages
   will be important for guiding future adaptations and enhancing
   resilience in ways that appropriately integrate localized ecosystem
   capacity and human needs.},

Abstract = {In the era of the Anthropocene, understanding the dynamic interactions
   between humans and water is crucial for supporting both human well-being
   and the sustainable management of resources. The current water
   management challenges are inherently unpredictable and difficult to
   control. Social-ecological systems (SESs) approaches explicitly
   recognize the connections and feedbacks between human and natural
   systems. For addressing the complex challenges of the Anthropocene,
   consideration of SES attributes such as causality (or interdependence),
   feedback, non-linearity, heterogeneity, and cross-scale dynamics is
   important. In addition, innovative qualitative and quantitative methods
   such as Bayesian networks, agent-based modelling, system dynamics,
   network analysis, multicriteria analysis, integrated assessment and
   role-play games have recently been used in SES research. The overall
   goal of this review is to gauge the extent to which SES attributes and
   methods are considered within the current interdisciplinary water
   paradigm. The paper therefore develops the normative theoretical
   characteristics of SES in terms of its key attributes (i.e. causality,
   feedback, heterogeneity, nonlinearity, and cross-scale dynamics)
   incorporated in the water paradigm approaches. The paper then compares
   the methods applied in the interdisciplinary water paradigm and examines
   how they can complement each other. Finally, the paper reflects back on
   the usefulness of SES attributes and methods for assessing the
   interdisciplinary water paradigm and makes recommendations for future
   research.},

Title = {Changes in institutional and social-ecological system robustness due to
   the adoption of large-scale irrigation technology in Navarre (Spain)},

Abstract = {Many regional and national organisations promote the modernisation of
   agriculture by supporting new technologies to increase their territory's
   competitiveness in a free-market context. Such technologies and their
   associated intensive land management practices are geared towards
   obtaining higher yields. However, their application also entails changes
   in water and land management institutions, which could alter
   interactions among multiple components of the agrarian social-ecological
   system and potentially weaken the system. Here, we assess how these
   components and their relations change in a village situated in Navarre
   (Spain) after the uptake of large-scale irrigation infrastructure.
   Specifically, we analyse such changes by comparing how the design
   principles for robust social-ecological systems manifest before and
   after the adoption of large-scale irrigation. Our findings indicate that
   an unequal distribution of water and land induces some farmers to
   abandon their agrarian activities. Our case study also shows how
   irrigation communities have partially lost their autonomy to
   self-organise and make agrarian management-related decisions. We suggest
   that the adoption of large-scale irrigation in this region contributes
   to a decrease in cooperation among resource users, and between users and
   infrastructure providers. This is due to a decline in the capacity to
   achieve collective-choice arrangements and higher external control and
   monitoring of water use. We argue that the current agrarian management
   changes may damage social-ecological system robustness and affect the
   sustainable use of common-pool resources, leading farmers to
   maladaptation to climate and market variability.},

Abstract = {A major problem worldwide is the potential loss of fisheries, forests,
   and water resources. Understanding of the processes that lead to
   improvements in or deterioration of natural resources is limited,
   because scientific disciplines use different concepts and languages to
   describe and explain complex social-ecological systems (SESs). Without a
   common framework to organize findings, isolated knowledge does not
   cumulate. Until recently, accepted theory has assumed that resource
   users will never self-organize to maintain their resources and that
   governments must impose solutions. Research in multiple disciplines,
   however, has found that some government policies accelerate resource
   destruction, whereas some resource users have invested their time and
   energy to achieve sustainability. A general framework is used to
   identify 10 subsystem variables that affect the likelihood of
   self-organization in efforts to achieve a sustainable SES.},

   theoretical multiplicity},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {57},
Pages = {1-9},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In recent years there has been rising scientific and policy interest in
   the adaptive governance of social ecological systems. A systematic
   literature review of adaptive governance research during the period
   2005-2014, demonstrates a vibrant debate taking place that spans a
   variety of empirical and theoretical approaches. The particular strength
   of adaptive governance is that it provides a theoretical lens for
   research that combines the analyses of novel governance capacities such
   as adaptive capacity, collaboration, scaling, knowledge and learning. As
   a way to give greater depth and analytical rigour to future studies over
   the next decade and beyond, we highlight the added value of theoretical
   multiplicity (i.e., focusing on the combination of theories to address
   complex problems). We argue that theoretical multiplicity can encourage
   stronger synergies between adaptive governance and other theoretical
   approaches and can help address epistemologically grey areas in adaptive
   governance scholarship, such as power and politics, inclusion and
   equity, short term and long term change, the relationship between public
   policy and adaptive governance. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Title = {How the Social-Ecological Systems Concept Can Guide Transdisciplinary
   Research and Implementation: Addressing Water Challenges in Central
   Northern Namibia},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Research aimed at contributing to the further development of integrated
   water resources management needs to tackle complex challenges at the
   interface of nature and society. A case study in the Cuvelai-Etosha
   Basin in Namibia has shown how semi-arid conditions coinciding with high
   population density and urbanisation present a risk to people's
   livelihoods and ecosystem health. In order to increase water security
   and promote sustainable water management, there is a requirement for
   problem-oriented research approaches combined with a new way of thinking
   about water in order to generate evidence-based, adapted solutions.
   Transdisciplinary research in particular addresses this issue by
   focusing on the problems that arise when society interacts with nature.
   This article presents the implementation of a transdisciplinary research
   approach in the above-mentioned case study. The concept of
   social-ecological systems (SES) plays a key role in operationalising the
   transdisciplinary research process. Application of the SES concept helps
   to outline the problem by defining the epistemic object, as well as
   structure the research process itself in terms of formulating research
   questions and developing the research design. It is argued here that the
   SES concept is not merely useful, but also necessary for guiding
   transdisciplinary sustainability research and implementation. The study
   from Namibia clearly demonstrates that the introduction of technological
   innovations such as rainwater and floodwater harvesting plants requires
   a social-ecological perspective. In particular this means considering
   questions around knowledge, practices and institutions related to water
   resources management and includes various societal innovations alongside
   technologies on the agenda.},

Abstract = {The use of shared infrastructure to direct natural processes for the
   benefit of humans has been a central feature of human social
   organization for millennia. Today, more than ever, people interact with
   one another and the environment through shared human-made infrastructure
   (the Internet, transportation, the energy grid, etc.). However, there
   has been relatively little work on how the design characteristics of
   shared infrastructure affect the dynamics of social-ecological systems
   (SESs) and the capacity of groups to solve social dilemmas associated
   with its provision. Developing such understanding is especially
   important in the context of global change where design criteria must
   consider how specific aspects of infrastructure affect the capacity of
   SESs to maintain vital functions in the face of shocks. Using
   small-scale irrigated agriculture (the most ancient and ubiquitous
   example of public infrastructure systems) as a model system, we show
   that two design features related to scale and the structure of benefit
   flows can induce fundamental changes in qualitative behavior, i.e.,
   regime shifts. By relating the required maintenance threshold (a design
   feature related to infrastructure scale) to the incentives facing users
   under different regimes, our work also provides some general guidance on
   determinants of robustness of SESs under globalization-related stresses.},

Title = {Defining and evaluating the social value of regional water resources in
   terms of emergy},
Journal = {WATER POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-90},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The social value of water resources must be considered when reforming
   water prices, improving water policy, protecting water resources and
   devising allocation methods. However, current social value theories for
   water resources are often unsound. The social value of water resources
   is defined here based on social system theory. Energy flow within a
   combined social-ecological system is analyzed, and an emergy analysis
   method for ecological economics is introduced for unified quantification
   and to improve the accounting method of the social value of water
   resources. Taking Zhengzhou in east-central China as an example, the
   social value of water resources is calculated for 2015. The water
   resources' total social emergy was 6.04 x 10(21) solar equivalent joules
   (sej) and the unit value was 6.58 x 10(12) sej/m(3). This corresponds to
   3.88\$/m(3), indicating that the social value of water resources is
   enormous. This paper proposes that the social value of water is an
   important component of its ecological economic value, and its social
   value should therefore be considered by water policy makers. Research of
   this type can be effective in helping to protect water resources and
   encourage efficient water use.},

Title = {Community-Led Green Land Acquisition: Social Innovative Initiatives for
   Forest Protection and Regional Development},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Land acquisition often involves power and displacement and can be
   carried out on a large scale. There are many forms of land acquisition,
   including for environmental and conservation purposes as well as for
   production activities. While green grabbing has joined land grabbing as
   an environmental justice issue of concern, it is not necessarily the
   case that all green land acquisition is large scale, done by powerful
   outsiders, or leads to displacement and exclusion. The outcomes of green
   land acquisition are dependent on the mechanisms used, the adequacy of
   resettlement and/or compensation, and the social and environmental
   context in which it happens. We discuss the outcomes of community-led
   land acquisition for conservation purposes in Costa Rica. We considered
   a special case of green land acquisition done by local civil society to
   defend the forest and water resources of the Juan Castro Blanco National
   Water Park in Costa Rica. We used the literature on green grabbing,
   social ecological systems, and social innovation to discuss local
   environmental governance and regional sustainable development. This
   paper makes a fresh contribution to environmental planning and
   environmental governance by bringing in aspects of green land
   acquisition that have not been previously explored.},

Journal = {RESTORATION ECOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1, SI},

Abstract = {Many ecosystems are actually social-ecological systems (SESs) consisting
   of mutually interacting natural and social subsystems. Resilience, the
   capacity to absorb or withstand perturbations while maintaining
   structure and functions, is an important feature of these systems.
   Indigenous or traditional knowledge is considered to be an important
   factor in being able to absorb change and maintain structure in the
   context of ecosystem dynamics. In this article, I use the framework of
   resilience to analyze how the Bedouin communities in Wadi Allaqi, Egypt,
   experienced and responded to the disturbing impact of Lake Nasser's
   formation in the mid-1960s. Prior to that disturbance, the Bedouin
   lifestyle was characterized by traditional pastoral life based on
   rotational grazing by their herds. Afterward, the Bedouins permanently
   settled along the shores to make use of the new abundant water resource.
   This resulted in overgrazing of the rangelands along the lakeside and
   the disappearance of the traditional pastoral lifestyle. However, the
   Bedouins later learned to use the Najas species in the lake, ushering in
   a new SES. This new system is based on tactical grazing along the
   shores, giving the rangelands the opportunity to recover from the
   temporary grazing pressure. I argue that because many degraded
   ecosystems are actually SESs, ecological restoration should also focus
   on societal-level measures.},

Title = {Increasing Social-Ecological Resilience by Placing Science at the

   Decision-Support System Model},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {14},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We have analyzed how the collaborative development process of a
   decision-support system (DSS) model can effectively contribute to
   increasing the resilience of regional social-ecological systems. In
   particular, we have focused on the case study of the transboundary San
   Pedro Basin, in the Arizona-Sonora desert region. This is a semi-arid
   watershed where water is a scarce resource used to cover competing human
   and environmental needs. We have outlined the essential traits in the
   development of the decision-support process that contributed to an
   improvement of water-resources management capabilities while increasing
   the potential for consensual problem solving. Comments and feedback from
   the stakeholders benefiting from the DSS in the San Pedro Basin are
   presented and analyzed within the regional (United States-Mexico
   boundary), social, and institutional context. We have indicated how
   multidisciplinary collaboration between academia and stakeholders can be
   an effective step toward collaborative management. Such technology
   transfer and capacity building provides a common arena for testing
   water-management policies and evaluating future scenarios. Putting
   science at the service of a participatory decision-making process can
   provide adaptive capacity to accommodate future change (i.e., building
   resilience in the management system).},

Title = {The effects of socialized agricultural services on rural collective
   action in the irrigation commons: Evidence from China},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {289},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Socialized agricultural services (SASs) have reshaped the smallholder
   agricultural system and promoted scale operations in rural China, but
   little is known about whether and how they affect rural collective
   action in the irrigation commons. Based on the social-ecological system
   framework, we apply an ordered probit model and a mediation model to
   examine the effects of SASs on rural collective action in the commons
   using a data set consisting of 7737 farm households from 448 villages in
   14 provinces in China. We show that SASs have a positive effect on
   collective action for the governance of the irrigation commons and can
   slow down and mitigate the negative effect of rural labor migration. In
   particular, SASs can help improve collective action by enhancing village
   leadership, fostering agricultural resource dependency, and diminishing
   economic heterogeneity among villagers. We contribute to the literature
   by investigating the effects of SASs on rural collective action, which
   reveals a self-regulatory mechanism inside of the social ecological
   system enabling it to adapt and restore balance under external shocks.
   Our findings have implications for the reform of the farming system and
   governance of the commons.},

Title = {Adaptive wetland management in an uncertain and changing arid
   environment},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Wetlands in the arid western United States provide rare and critical
   migratory bird habitat and constitute a critical nexus within larger
   social-ecological systems (SES) where multiple changing land-use and
   water-use patterns meet. The Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge in Utah,
   USA, presents a case study of the ways that wetland managers have
   created adaptive management strategies that are responsive to the social
   and hydrological conditions of the agriculture-dominated SES within
   which they are located. Managers have acquired water rights and
   constructed infrastructure while cultivating collaborative relationships
   with other water users to increase the adaptive capacity of the region
   and decrease conflict. Historically, water management involved diversion
   and impoundment of water within wetland units timed around patterns of
   agricultural water needs. In the last 20 years, managers have learned
   from flood and drought events and developed a long-term adaptive
   management plan that specifies alternative management actions managers
   can choose each year based on habitat needs and projected water supply.
   Each alternative includes habitat goals and target wetland water depth.
   However, wetland management adapted to agricultural return-flow
   availability may prove insufficient as population growth and climate
   change alter patterns of land and water use. Future management will
   likely depend more on negotiation, collaboration, and learning from
   social developments within the SES than strictly focusing on water
   management within refuge boundaries. To face this problem, managers have
   worked to be included in negotiations with regional water users, a
   strategy that may prove instructive for other wetland managers in
   agriculture-dominated watersheds.},

Journal = {EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Despite near-global consensus on the Sustainable Development Goals and
   the Paris Climate Agreement, unre-solved and politically contentious
   trade-offs have undermined implementation. One exemplary case facing
   difficult trade-offs are Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus cases. Here, we
   extend the nascent `Social-Ecological Action Situations' framework to
   analyse past coevolution of WEF nexus cases (or other social-ecological
   systems) to envision possible futures where trade-offs are equally
   considered and minimized. We illustrate the value of the approach for a
   WEF nexus case in Switzerland with upstream hydropower reservoirs,
   water-bound biodiversity, and emerging downstream agricultural
   irrigation needs. The proposed solution-oriented, transformative
   approach goes beyond existing frameworks by analysing past coevolution
   of the intertwined system to build system understanding and to envision
   a future with concrete policies that would result in a higher adaptive
   capacity of the system and a compromise within the WEF nexus. We argue
   that this perspective helps to devise policies to address trade-offs in
   WEF nexus cases and thereby to tackle global crises.},

Title = {River basins as social-ecological systems: linking levels of societal
   and ecosystem water metabolism in a semiarid watershed},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {River basin modeling under complexity requires analytical frameworks
   capable of dealing with the multiple scales and dimensions of
   environmental problems as well as uncertainty in the evolution of social
   systems. Conceptual and methodological developments can now be framed
   using the wide socio-eco-hydrological approach. We add hierarchy theory
   into the mix to discuss the conceptualization of river basins as
   complex, holarchic social-ecological systems. We operationalize the
   social-ecological systems water metabolism framework in a semiarid
   watershed in Spain, and add the governance dimension that shapes
   human-environment reciprocity. To this purpose, we integrate an
   eco-hydrological model with the societal metabolism accounting scheme
   for land use, human activity, and water use. We explore four types of
   interactions: between societal organization and water uses/demands,
   between ecosystem organization and their water requirements/supplies,
   between societal metabolism and aquatic ecosystem health, and between
   water demand and availability. Our results reveal a metabolic pattern of
   a high mountain rural system striving to face exodus and agricultural
   land abandonment with a multifunctional economy. Centuries of
   social-ecological evolution shaping waterscapes through traditional
   water management practices have influenced the eco-hydrological
   functioning of the basin, enabling adaptation to aridity. We found a
   marked spatial gradient on water supply, use pattern, and impact on
   water bodies from the head to the mouth of the basin. Management
   challenges posed by the European water regulatory framework as a new
   driver of social-ecological change are highlighted.},

Title = {Implementing Integrated Catchment Management in the upper Limpopo River
   basin: A situational assessment},
Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {104-118},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A three-phase study was initiated as a way to promote Integrated
   Catchment Management approaches in the Limpopo River basin. This paper
   presents the situational assessment, which should enable De Beers to
   understand how their Venetia Mine operations are located within a
   broader and highly dynamic socioeconomic and ecohydrological landscape
   as it pertains to water risks. The second phase, Risk assessment, aims
   to develop conservation interventions in the identified areas; the third
   phase will develop mechanisms for implementing water stewardship schemes
   to mitigate the shared water risks.
   Analysis of the social-ecological system (hydrological, climatic,
   ecological, socio-economic and governance systems) of the Limpopo River
   basin indicates that the institutional arrangement of the Limpopo River
   basin is neither simple nor effective. The basin is rapidly approaching
   closure in the sense that almost all of the available supplies of water
   have already been allocated to existing water users. If the proposed
   ecological flow requirements were to be met for all of the tributaries,
   the basin would be `closed'. On-going and projected land use changes and
   water resources developments in the upper reaches of the basin, coupled
   with projected rainfall reductions and temperature increases, and
   allocation of the flows for the ecological reserve, are likely to
   further reduce downstream river flows. The coupled increase in
   temperature and decrease in rainfall is of great concern for everyone in
   the basin, especially the poorer communities, who rely on rain-fed
   agriculture for their livelihoods. Increased temperatures also lead to
   increased evaporation from reservoirs and therefore result in a decrease
   in water availability. This will lead to increased abstraction of
   groundwater, especially from alluvial aquifers, and consequently an
   increase in river transmission losses and a decrease in river flows. (C)

Title = {To manage inland fisheries is to manage at the social-ecological
   watershed scale},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {181},
Pages = {312-325},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Approaches to managing inland fisheries vary between systems and regions
   but are often based on large-scale marine fisheries principles and thus
   limited and outdated. Rarely do they adopt holistic approaches that
   consider the complex interplay among humans, fish, and the environment.
   We argue that there is an urgent need for a shift in inland fisheries
   management towards holistic and transdisciplinary approaches that
   embrace the principles of social-ecological systems at the watershed
   scale. The interconnectedness of inland fisheries with their associated
   watershed (biotic, abiotic, and humans) make them extremely complex and
   challenging to manage and protect. For this reason, the watershed is a
   logical management unit. To assist management at this scale, we propose
   a framework that integrates disparate concepts and management paradigms
   to facilitate inland fisheries management and sustainability. We contend
   that inland fisheries need to be managed as social-ecological watershed
   system (SEWS). The framework supports watershed-scale and transboundary
   governance to manage inland fisheries, and trans disciplinary projects
   and teams to ensure relevant and applicable monitoring and research. We
   discuss concepts of social-ecological feedback and interactions of
   multiple stressors and factors within/between the social-ecological
   systems. Moreover, we emphasize that management, monitoring, and
   research on inland fisheries at the watershed scale are needed to ensure
   long-term sustainable and resilient fisheries. (C) 2016 Published by

Title = {Micro-level crafting of institutions within integrated catchment
   management: Early lessons of adaptive governance from a catchment-based
   approach case study in England},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {53},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {There has been considerable interest and discussion surrounding
   institutional design and governance in the areas of planning, political
   studies and policy development and more recently natural resource
   management. Within England, like much of Europe, an integrated catchment
   management, called the catchment-based approach (CaBA), has been
   developed when implementing the European Union (EU) Water Framework
   Directive (WFD). This is seen as both a driver for stricter standards
   for water quality and ecological status in water course and encouraging
   the active involvement of stakeholders and communities in both planning
   and action. This paper analyses institutional design at the local level
   from the perspective of two concepts, namely institutional governance
   and social-ecological systems. The intension is to highlight synergies
   between the two concepts. Through this a new aspect of institutional
   design is revealed, the micro-level or `crafting' of institutions by
   local actors. The paper identifies criteria that are associated with
   this aspect and analyses an integrated catchment case study in England.
   The paper concludes that the current policy approach in England, and
   potentially elsewhere in Europe, offers potential for the `crafting' of
   institutions and at the local social-ecological systems scale this has
   potential for positive benefits such as great understanding and locally
   effective governance. Both would assist in achieving policy objectives,
   such as those of the WFD. The case study utilised an effective
   participatory approach that was, according to the criteria, robust and
   transferable in developing an adaptive governance approach. (C) 2015

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {In Azraq in Eastern Jordan, farmers, domestic users, and a wetland
   ecosystem compete for and overexploit limited groundwater resources.
   Current studies explain parts of the problem, but do not take a
   comprehensive social-ecological systems perspective and tend to miss
   underlying hidden factors. To explain decision-making in this complex
   social-ecological system, we combine the concept of networks of action
   situations (NAS) with the political economy concept of the social
   contract. While the NAS allows a systematic exploration of the system,
   the concept of the social contract allows a deeper understanding of how
   informal institutions and power influence the system. Besides a
   comprehensive literature review, we draw on social network mapping and
   67 semi-structured interviews with relevant stakeholders. We find that
   the main conflict arises between a heterogeneous group of farmers, who
   use groundwater for irrigation agriculture supported by a strong
   political lobby, and the water authorities, which rely on the aquifer
   for domestic water supply at national level. The original wetland with
   its diverse ecosystem services has largely disappeared and its remainder
   is maintained artificially. Our analysis reveals that a diversity of
   action situations, including water, agricultural, environmental, energy,
   and land governance, but also the monarchy's underlying social contract
   and the informal concept of wasta, influence outcomes on the ground. We
   show that no panacea exists, but that systems thinking may help identify
   a range of intervention points, some more sensitive than others, that
   could support a social-ecological transformation towards sustainability.},

Abstract = {In this study, we examined the extent to which global warming management
   is currently integrated into the European Water Framework Directive
   (WFD), the central legal framework for water management in the EU. We
   focused on the Elbe River Basin District and how global warming is
   addressed in its water management. We used the social-ecological systems
   (SES) approach as our theoretical framework, representing an eminent
   analytical frame of biosphere-based sustainability science. In our
   study, we analysed core characteristics of SES in the context of global
   warming to evaluate the effectiveness of current water management in the
   Elbe River basin concerning long-term changing climate conditions. To
   determine to what extent each SES feature is considered in the Elbe
   water management, we applied a scale of 1 to 5. Our results show that
   the SES feature ``scale and openness{''} is best addressed (score 4.0)
   by the Elbe River basin management, followed by ``context dependency{''}
   (score 3.9); however, ``non-linearity, uncertainty, unpredictability{''}
   (score 3.2), ``self-organisation and adaptability{''} (score 3.1), and
   ``dynamics{''} (score 3.0) have only moderate impacts. SES features can
   only be considered comprehensively if global warming is accounted for in
   an integrated way at a European level. In order to ensure effective
   implementation, explicit regulations and legally binding obligations are
   most likely required.},

Title = {Understanding how governance emerges in social-ecological systems:
   insights from archetype analysis},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {. This paper is motivated by the question: how does governance emerge
   within social-ecological systems (SESs)? Addressing this question is
   critical for fostering sustainable transformations because it directs
   attention to the context specific and process intensive nature of
   governance as arising from the internal dynamics (i.e., interplay of
   feedbacks and interdependencies between the components) of SESs. This
   contrasts with the commonly held view of governance as an external
   intervention applied to a system. To systematically examine the
   recurrent patterns in how the internal dynamics promote/detract from the
   emergence of different types of governance, we applied archetype
   analysis to 60 selected cases of irrigation systems from Asia. Drawing
   inspiration from grid-group typology of cultural theory, we developed
   four specific archetypes: egalitarian, individualist, hierarchical, and
   fatalist. To build these archetypes, we applied a robustness framework
   and several other theories/perspectives to identify the different
   social-ecological and infrastructural attributes of irrigation SESs, and
   their interdependencies and feedback structures. We then used these
   attributes, identified through our theoretical review, to deductively
   code our selected cases and classify them into the different archetypes.
   The results show the different configurations of attributes that
   co-occur in each archetype, and how together these attributes and their
   inter-relationships lead to specific types of governance. Our archetype
   analysis also provides several interesting examples of fine-tuning
   between different SES attributes and how this fine-tuning is being
   threatened by various social and environmental changes. Through a
   systematic exploration of recurrent patterns using archetype analysis,
   our work builds on past efforts to apply ideas from complexity
   theory-specifically emergence-to unpack the complexities of SESs and
   offer practical guidance for fostering sustainability.},

Abstract = {Elinor Ostrom was a leader in using multiple methods to perform
   institutional analysis. In this paper, we discuss how a multi-method
   approach she pioneered may be used to study the robustness of
   social-ecological systems. We synthesize lessons learned from a series
   of studies on small-scale irrigation systems in which we use case-study
   analysis, experimental methods in laboratory and field settings, and
   mathematical models. The accumulated insights show the importance of
   creating institutional arrangements that fit the human ecology within
   the biophysical constraints of the system. The examples of work based on
   multiple methods approaches presented here highlight several lessons.
   For example, experimental work helps us better understand the details of
   how the ability to maintain trust relationships, low levels of
   inequality, and low transaction costs of coordination are critical for
   success. Likewise, the integration of case-study analysis and modeling
   helps us better understand how systems that can leverage biophysical
   characteristics to help address challenges of monitoring, sanctioning,
   and coordination may be able to increase their chances of success.},

Volume = {18},

Abstract = {Climate change is increasing the frequency and the severity of extreme
   events in river basins around the world. Efforts to build resilience to
   these impacts are complicated by the social-ecological interactions,
   cross-scale feedbacks, and diverse actor interests that influence the
   dynamics of change in social-ecological systems (SESs). In this study,
   we aimed to explore big-picture scenarios of a river basin under climate
   change by characterizing future change as emergent from interactions
   between diverse efforts to build resilience and a complex, cross-scale
   SES. To do so, we facilitated a transdisciplinary scenario modeling
   process structured by the cross-impact balances (CIB) method, a
   semi-quantitative method that applies systems theory to generate
   internally consistent narrative scenarios from a network of interacting
   drivers of change. Thus, we also aimed to explore the potential for the
   CIB method to surface diverse perspectives and drivers of change in
   SESs. We situated this process in the Red River Basin, a transboundary
   basin shared by the United States and Canada where significant natural
   climatic variability is worsened by climate change. The process
   generated 15 interacting drivers ranging from agricultural markets to
   ecological integrity, generating eight consistent scenarios that are
   robust to model uncertainty. The scenario analysis and the debrief
   workshop reveal important insights, including the transformative changes
   required to achieve desirable outcomes and the cornerstone role of
   Indigenous water rights. In sum, our analysis surfaced significant
   complexities surrounding efforts to build resilience and affirmed the
   potential for the CIB method to generate unique insights about the
   trajectory of SESs.},

Title = {Biophysical and sociocultural factors underlying spatial trade-offs of

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Biophysical and social systems are linked to form social-ecological
   systems whose sustainability depends on their capacity to absorb
   uncertainty and cope with disturbances. In this study, we explored the
   key biophysical and socio-cultural factors underlying ecosystem service
   supply in two semiarid watersheds of southern Spain. These included
   variables associated with the role that freshwater flows and
   biodiversity play in securing the system's capacity to sustain essential
   ecosystem services and their relationship with social demand for
   services, local water governance, and land-use intensification. Our
   results reveal the importance of considering the invisible dimensions of
   water and biodiversity, i.e. green freshwater flows and trait-based
   indicators, because of their relevance to the supply of ecosystem
   services. Furthermore, they uncover the importance of traditional
   irrigation canals, a local water governance system, in maintaining the
   ecosystems' capacity to supply services. The study also highlights the
   complex trade-offs that occur because of the spatial mismatch between
   ecosystem service supply (upstream) and ecosystem service demand
   (downstream) in watersheds. Finally, we found that land-use
   intensification generally resulted in losses of the biophysical factors
   that underpin the supply of some ecosystem services, increases in social
   demand for less diversified services, and the abandonment of local
   governance practices. Attempts to manage social-ecological systems
   toward sustainability at the local scale should identify the key
   biophysical and socio-cultural factors that are essential for
   maintaining ecosystem services and should recognize existing
   interrelationships between them. Land-use management should also take
   into account ecosystem service trade-offs and the consequences resulting
   from land-use intensification.},

Title = {Environmental variability and collective action: Experimental insights
   from an irrigation game},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {166-176},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Studies of collective action in commons dilemmas in social-ecological
   systems typically focus on scenarios in which actors all share symmetric
   (or similar) positions in relation to the common-pool resource. Many
   common social-ecological systems do not meet these criteria, most
   notably, irrigation systems. Participants in irrigation systems must
   solve two related collective action problems: 1) the provisioning of
   physical infrastructure necessary to utilize the resource (water), and
   2) the asymmetric common-pool resource dilemma where the relative
   positions of ``head-enders{''} and ``tail-enders{''} generate asymmetric
   access to the resource itself (water). In times of scarcity, head-enders
   have an incentive to not share water with tail-enders. Likewise,
   tail-enders have an incentive to not provide labor to maintain the
   system if they do not receive water. These interdependent incentives may
   induce a cooperative outcome under favorable conditions. However, how
   robust is this system of interdependent incentives in the presence of
   environmental variability that generates uncertainty about water
   availability either through variation in the water supply itself or
   through shocks to infrastructure? This paper reports on results from
   laboratory experiments designed to address this question. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Researchers and decision-makers lack a shared understanding of

   We define socio-economic resilience management as planning, adaptation
   and transformational actions that may influence these system
   characteristics. We integrate the three Rs into a heuristic for
   resilience management that we apply in multiple management contexts to
   offer practical, systematic guidance about how to realize resilience.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a shift toward the integrated governance of
   watersheds as a basis for fostering health, sustainability and
   social-ecological resilience. The authors suggest that integrated
   watershed governance is more likely when different perspectives,
   including health and well-being, are explicitly understood,
   communicated, and sought as co-benefits of watershed management. A new
   conceptual device - the watershed governance prism - is introduced in
   relation to the multiple facets of governance that characterize
   contemporary water resources management and examined as an integrative
   framework to link social and environmental concerns with the
   determinants of health in the watershed context. The authors assess the
   diagnostic and communicative potential of such a framework, discussing
   its utility as a concise depiction of multiple, interacting policy
   priorities and as a guide to integrate different research and policy
   domains into the governance of water, health and social-ecological
   systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Governance},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Much of the world's agricultural lands are projected to face hydrologic
   and climatic changes that will lead to water scarcity and corresponding
   food insecurity. The emergent response of complex social-ecological
   systems to change requires rapid response and tailored solutions.
   Top-down responses without room for local self-organization may fail to
   implement effective solutions, yet self-organization alone may be too
   slow to respond in a period of rapid change and may lack the
   accountability necessary in the management of a public resource such as
   water. This research relies on concepts of governing complexity to
   assess the role of local self-organization nested within formal
   institutions in developing adaptive solutions to conflict involving
   irrigated agriculture in Idaho's Upper Snake River Basin. While formal
   institutions have provided a framework, steering, and resources for
   local action, the organization of water users dependent on the resource
   plays a large role in the ability of the region to adapt to water supply
   disturbances, highlighting the importance of local capacity within an
   umbrella of governmental steering to respond to rising water resources
   issues in semi-arid regions.},

Title = {Adaptive Water Governance: Integrating the Human Dimensions into Water
   Resource Governance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY WATER RESEARCH \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {158},
Number = {1},
Pages = {2-18},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The command-and-control paradigm of water resource management that
   dominated 20th century water policy has resulted in vulnerabilities due
   to its inadequate consideration of the human dimensions as well as its
   failure to prioritize the need for learning and adapting to change and
   uncertainties. In response to these shortfalls, recent years have seen
   the emergence of alternative water policy frameworks, notably integrated
   water resource management (IWRM) and adaptive management. However, while
   IWRM broadens the planning goals and scope of water resource governance
   through integration and coordination across scales and sectors, it does
   not adequately emphasize learning to deal with uncertainty. On the other
   hand, adaptive management emphasizes the need to prioritize learning to
   deal with uncertainty in resource management through monitoring and
   experimentation, but places less emphasis on the human dimensions
   required for its successful implementation. This paper discusses
   adaptive water governance - collaborative, flexible, and learning-based
   institutions that connect state and non-state actors across multiple
   levels for ecosystem-based management of land and water resources - as a
   promising institutional mechanism for integrating the human dimensions
   into water resource governance while building the capacity of water
   resource systems to learn and adapt to change. The paper highlights four
   attributes of adaptive water governance: (1) reintegrating humans into
   nature; (2) integrating diverse sources and types of knowledge; (3)
   promoting adaptive and integrative management goals; and (4) using
   polycentric institutions and analytic deliberation processes. Through
   these mechanisms, adaptive governance can contribute to sustainability,
   good governance, conflict management, and social-ecological resilience
   in water resource systems.},

Abstract = {An integrated approach to understanding ecosystem service values in
   Wyoming and Montana, USA is presented. The assessment encompasses a
   major river basin, and includes a synthesis of existing data and
   research related to the natural system and separate data collection
   efforts regarding the social and economic importance of ecosystem
   services. A holistic look at the social-ecological system provides
   nuanced information about ecosystem service values and tradeoffs for the
   purpose of public land decision-making.
   The initial ecological assessment concluded that water resources were
   particularly vulnerable, which guided the social and economic
   assessments. The social assessment applied Q-methodology, ultimately
   identifying and exploring four archetypes regarding views on the
   importance of 34 ecosystem services, which were dubbed
   ``environmental{''}, ``agricultural{''}, ``Native American{''}, and
   ``recreation{''}. The economic assessment applied choice modeling to
   understand non-market values of ecosystem services (i.e., agricultural
   community, aquatic biodiversity, river angling, and motorized winter
   recreation), and latent class analysis provided insight into preference
   heterogeneity previously indicated in the social assessment. The
   structured approach can inform natural resource decision-making by
   including several different perspectives, integrating multiple spatial
   scales, highlighting particular ecosystem services as relevant within
   the context of many ecosystem services, and facilitating relations
   between the public and natural resource stewards.},

Abstract = {We analyze archetypes of farmer groups conducting pond aquaculture
   across the province of Nusa Tenggara Barat, Indonesia using Ostrom's
   social-ecological systems framework. Pond aquaculture farmers share
   coastal irrigation infrastructure as common property, among other
   resources, and are encouraged by the government to organize into groups
   with varying sets of evolved rules, norms, social practices and
   environmental conditions shaping what they produce, how and how much.
   Yet little is known about the diversity of these pond aquaculture
   communities, or what factors-both social and ecological-shape production
   trends and sustainability outcomes. We designed a standardized survey to
   collect data on 26 indicators from 85 diverse community-based fish
   farmer groups across the province. Data included indicators on
   ownership, rules, history, production trends, demographics, government
   involvement, livelihood dependence, environmental characteristics and
   risks. Clustering analysis was applied to identify five unique
   archetypes of pond aquaculture communities, each distinguished by a
   different set of development challenges and opportunities. Our findings
   highlight the need to move beyond a `one-size-fits-all' policy approach.
   We suggest moving towards a locally adapted capacity building strategy
   that can recognize contextual needs so that policy programs can better
   target and differentiate between farmer groups that face similar
   challenges. We further discuss how empowering collective action among
   the farmers can reduce risks associated with producing blue food for
   local consumption and regional markets.},

Abstract = {The past several decades have seen significant changes in how
   governments approach water management decisions. This paper reviews 12
   major water management decisions in Queensland, Australia, during
   1980-2006. The resilience paradigm was used to place the water
   management decisions in a social-ecological systems context rather than
   the traditional water resource context. The social-ecological context
   was interrogated through three parameters: scientific knowledge,
   environment and institutions for each of the decisions. Results
   indicate: (a) a trend for increased adoption of formalised integrative
   (social, economic and environmental factors) evaluation methods (such as
   benefit cost analysis and environmental impact assessment) in the
   scientific knowledge parameter of social-ecological context; (b) the
   environmental parameter (e.g. drought) influenced the timing of water
   decisions; and (c) a possible threshold was found within the
   institutional context, i.e. change of State leadership, which determined
   the regime or type of water decision under consideration e.g.. supply or
   demand dominated management. These findings provide insight to policy
   makers and scientists on the importance of social-ecological context in
   the assessment of State water decisions.},

Title = {A spatial approach to climate-resilient infrastructure in coastal
   social-ecological systems: The case of <i>dumbeong</i> in Goseong
   County, South Korea},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {131},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Sustainable landscape planning and management of coastal habitats has
   become an integral part of the global agenda due to anthroprogenic
   pressures and climate change-induced events. As an example of
   human-engineered infrastructure that enhances the sustainability and
   resilience of coastal social-ecological systems (SES), we have presented
   the dumbeong system, a farmer-engineered and managed irrigation system
   based on Korean traditional ecological knowledge. We analyzed the
   spatial relationship of dumbeongs with coastal landscape attributes and
   droughts in Goseong County in South Korea. We used generalized linear
   models (GLMs) to examine the effects of land cover and recent
   (2001-2010) standardized precipitation index (SPI) on the abundance of
   dumbeongs. Then, we projected near future (2020-2050) changes in the
   SPI-based drought risk for the dumbeong system using representative
   concentration pathway (RCP) climate scenarios. We found that forest and
   marine water areas have positive relations with dumbeong abundance,
   whereas SPI has a negative relation, indicating that the dumbeongs are
   more abundant in areas close to sea water and forests, and with higher
   incidences of drought. Derived climate change scenarios show that the
   study region will experience higher incidence of drought. Our findings
   provide empirical evidence for the dumbeong system as an effective
   community designed and driven adaptive response to local hydrological
   processes and climatic conditions, and as climate-resilient
   infrastructure that strengthens sustainability and resilience of coastal
   SES. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for sustainable
   landscape management and optimal use of the dumbeong system in coastal
   regions.},

Title = {Hydrosocial territories in transition: Implications of traditional
   agricultural and irrigation water management practices under the effects
   of social, institutional, and environmental changes in Ladakh, India},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {47},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Traditional societies have played a vital role in the management and
   development of their local environments through their knowledge and
   practices. The engagement of people with their im-mediate environment
   has historically shaped the landscapes and their way of life. This
   reciprocal relationship between human beings and their natural
   environments, both in its historical and contemporary perspectives, is
   significant in sustainability research. Ladakh in India is a high
   -altitude cold desert region. Water is a scarce resource, and the local
   communities have devel-oped unique water management practices that shape
   livelihoods and landscapes. This study aims to analyze the traditional
   water management practices in Ladakh through the lens of human --nature
   relationships to establish its significance in the contemporary regional
   context. It utilizes primary survey data and GIS to establish how
   traditional water management practices are bounded by hydrosocial
   territories. Using the social-ecological systems framework, this study
   identifies the changes experienced by these hydrosocial territories in
   the context of social, institutional, and environmental spheres. The
   results from this study contribute to the scholarship on hydrosocial
   territories in Ladakh that represent a balanced human-nature
   relationship by means of traditional water management practices, and
   highlight its significance in framing pol-icies for sustainable
   management of scarce water resources in the region.},

Title = {Understanding the effects of institutional diversity on irrigation
   systems dynamics},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {191},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Comparative institutional analyses of social-ecological systems (SESs)
   have advanced our understanding of features and performances of single
   institutions such as state, market, and self-organized institutions.
   However, such studies have hardly extended our understanding of
   institutional diversity to combinations of different institutions and
   their joint impacts on the dynamics of SES. We address this gap by
   focusing on governmentmanaged irrigation systems as a quintessential
   example of SESs. We developed a formal stylized model to examine how
   institutions affect social processes in a government-managed irrigation
   system. More specifically, we examine how infrastructure dynamics and
   farmers-agency interactions are affected under the coexistence of two
   institutions: groundwater market and participatory institutions. The
   former institutionalizes the use of private irrigation infrastructures
   as an exit option to the public infrastructure managed by a government
   agency (exit). The latter institutionalizes farmers' voicing of concerns
   and participation as a pressure mechanism on the agency (voice). The
   model results show that the joint effects of those institutions on
   system outcomes vary with the agency's reactions to the exit and voice.
   We also demonstrate that the silence option - use of neither option - is
   a double-edged sword. Silent farmers can impede infrastructure
   improvement, but in some cases, help it dramatically.},

Abstract = {Shaping policy for environmental sustainability depends upon
   decision-makers conceptualizing problems in ways that are either shared
   or similar enough to communicate about, diagnose, and act. The quality
   of this shared mental model of a social-ecological system (SES) is
   paramount to its effectiveness. Fundamentally, the mental model must
   integrate multiple kinds of knowledge about the system. If the
   decision-making body's assumptions about, description of, and solution
   for a problem do not to reflect the many ways stakeholders know a
   system, then the products of that decision-making process are viewed as
   illegitimate. Sustainability policy must fit the often subtle social
   order of the communities expected to implement it. In this essay, we
   discuss how a systems-based perspective can be a versatile tool for
   tackling these challenges of knowledge integration and decision-making
   in the context of a complex SES. Using social theory of Pierre Bourdieu,
   we construct a conceptual model that illustrates a route for integrating
   locally known social complexities (power, influence) gleaned from
   stakeholder interviews (N = 57). Stakeholders and end-user groups may
   dismiss any model that they perceive fails to satisfactorily account for
   specific, locally salient social nuances. Our approach leverages the
   overlapping notion of ``capital{''} in social and ecological theory to
   demonstrate how reciprocal interactions between human and ecological
   systems can be adopted into tools for reaching viable solutions to SES
   problems.},

Title = {The Role of Common-Pool Resources' Institutional Robustness in a
   Collective Action Dilemma under Environmental Variations},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Extreme environmental variations, as a phenomenon deriving from climate
   change, led to an exacerbated uncertainty on water availability and
   increased the likelihood of conflicts regarding water-dependent
   activities such as agriculture. In this paper, we investigate the role
   of conflict resolution mechanisms-one of Ostrom's acclaimed Design
   Principles-when social-ecological systems are exposed to physical
   external disturbances. The theoretical propositions predict that
   social-ecological systems with conflict-resolution mechanisms will
   perform better than those without them. We tested this proposition
   through a framed field experiment that mimicked an irrigation system.
   This asymmetric setting exposed farmers to two (2) dilemmas: (i) how
   much to invest in the communal irrigation system's maintenance and (ii)
   how much water to extract. The setting added a layer of complexity:
   water availability depended not only on the investment but also on the
   environmental variability. Our findings confirmed the theoretical
   proposition: groups with stronger `institutional robustness' can cope
   with environmental variations better than those with weaker robustness.
   However, we also found that some groups, despite lacking
   conflict-resolution mechanisms, were also able to address environmental
   variations. We explored potential explanatory variables to these
   unexpected results. We found that subjects' and groups' attributes might
   address uncertainty and avert conflict. Thus, social-ecological systems'
   capacity to respond to external disturbances, such as environmental
   variations, might not only be a question of Design Principles. Instead,
   it might also be strongly related to group members' attributes and group
   dynamics. Our results pave the way for further research, hinting that
   some groups might be better equipped for mitigation measures, while
   others might be better equipped for adaptation measures.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {The question of how to govern the multiscale problems in today's network
   society is an important topic in the fields of public administration,
   political sciences, and environmental sciences. How scales are defined,
   studied, and dealt with varies substantially within and across these
   fields. This paper aims to reduce the existing conceptual confusion
   regarding scales by disentangling three representative approaches that
   address both governance and scaling: monocentric governance, multilevel
   governance, and adaptive governance. It does so by analyzing the
   differences in (1) underlying views on governing, (2) assumptions about
   scales, (3) dominant problem definitions regarding scales, and (4)
   preferred responses for dealing with multiple scales. Finally, this
   paper identifies research opportunities within and across these
   approaches.},

   principles for common-pool resource management in the lower Mekong basin
   social-ecological system},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {New methods have emerged for testing common-pool resource theory in
   large-scale environmental governance contexts. We aim to contribute to
   that scholarship by assessing the relevance of Elinor Ostrom's design
   principles in the lower Mekong basin (LMB). The recent dam-building
   trend in the LMB has revealed a trade-off between hydropower development
   and the conservation of migratory fish species. The need to internalize
   or avoid the negative externalities of hydropower dam construction poses
   a new challenge to the LMB governance system and its main management
   body, the Mekong River Commission. Our objective was to explain the
   emergence of the trade-off and the capacity of the governance system to
   address it. Elinor Ostrom's design principles and other variables
   provided by the Socio-ecological Systems Meta-analysis Database were
   first coded with regard to secondary data and then tested against the
   capacity for cooperation of the LMB governance system. The lack of
   sanctioning despite a strong monitoring system, and the existence of
   fuzzy governance boundaries in the context of a powerful outsider like
   China, were particularly relevant to understanding the current
   cooperation stalemate in the basin. Other variables such as scientific
   knowledge, triggering events, markets, resource spatial heterogeneity,
   and heterogeneity of interests were also relevant.},

Title = {Livestock Farming at the Expense of Water Resources? The
   Water-Energy-Food Nexus in Regions with Intensive Livestock Farming},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Policymaking in the water-energy-food nexus is characterized by complex
   ecological, social, and economic interdependencies. Nexus research
   assumes these interactions to be overseen in the respective resource
   governance resulting in sectoral perspectives contributing to
   unsustainable outcomes. In Germany, the political priority given to the
   formation of an internationally competitive livestock sector by means of
   intensification, specialization and regional concentration has exerted
   sustained pressure on water and soil resources. The expansion of
   bioenergy plants promoted by the renewable energy act has exacerbated
   the situation. Despite the persistency of the ecological challenges,
   German policymakers only reacted when the European Commission referred
   Germany to the European Court of Justice. Current policy efforts to
   tackle the ecological problems are now provoking disruptions in the
   agrarian sector in regions with high nitrate concentrations in water
   resources. By combining the social-ecological systems framework with
   hypotheses derived from nexus research, we explore the interactions
   between food, water and energy systems and aim at understanding the
   unsustainable outcomes. We argue that the non-consideration of the
   complex interdependencies between the agricultural, the water and the
   energy system in policymaking and the divergence of policy goals
   constitute a major cause of unsustainable governance.},

Title = {Institutional Fit and River Basin Governance: a New Approach Using
   Multiple Composite Measures},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The notion that effective environmental governance depends in part on
   achieving a reasonable fit between institutional arrangements and the
   features of ecosystems and their interconnections with users has been
   central to much thinking about social-ecological systems for more than a
   decade. Based on expert consultations this study proposes a set of six
   dimensions of fit for water governance regimes and then empirically
   explores variation in measures of these in 28 case studies of national
   parts of river basins in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa drawing
   on a database compiled by the Twin2Go project. The six measures capture
   different but potentially important dimensions of fit: allocation,
   integration, conservation, basinization, participation, and adaptation.
   Based on combinations of responses to a standard questionnaire filled in
   by groups of experts in each basin we derived quantitative measures for
   each indicator. Substantial variation in these measures of fit was
   apparent among basins in developing and developed countries.
   Geographical location is not a barrier to high institutional fit; but
   within basins different measures of fit often diverge. This suggests it
   is difficult, but not impossible, to simultaneously achieve a high fit
   against multiple challenging conditions. Comparing multidimensional fit
   profiles give a sense of how well water governance regimes are equipped
   for dealing with a range of natural resource and use-related conditions
   and suggests areas for priority intervention. The findings of this study
   thus confirm and help explain previous work that has concluded that
   context is important for understanding the variable consequences of
   institutional reform on water governance practices as well as on social
   and environmental outcomes.},

Title = {The Land-Water-Food Nexus: Expanding the Social-Ecological System
   Framework to Link Land and Water Governance},
Journal = {RESOURCES-BASEL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {To date, the land-water-food nexus has been primarily addressed from an
   ecological, hydrological or agronomic angle, with limited response to
   the governance interface between the input resources. Likewise, in
   widely used heuristic frameworks, such as the social-ecological system
   (SES) framework, governance interactions between resources are not
   sufficiently addressed. We address this gap empirically, using the case
   of Tajikistan, based on a farm household survey analysis of 306 farmers.
   The results indicate that land system variables contribute to the
   willingness to cooperate in irrigation management. Specifically, formal
   land tenure has a positive effect on farmers paying for water as well as
   on the likelihood of their investing time and effort in irrigation
   infrastructure, which is decisive for Tajikistan's food and fiber
   production. Irrigation system variables show that, e.g., being an
   upstream user increases the likelihood to contribute to labor
   maintenance efforts. We further discuss how decisions with respect to
   the land sector could be designed in the future to facilitate
   cooperation in other resource sectors. Further, we conclude from a
   conceptual perspective that the SES framework integrating a nexus
   perspective can be adapted: either (1) by adding a second-tier
   governance nexus variable inside the governance variable of an
   irrigation system; or (2) by adding a land resource unit and system
   outside the irrigation system.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},

Volume = {219},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Oases provide the most important support to human livelihood and
   economic activities in drylands. In recent decades, nature and humanity
   in oases areas have been increasingly integrated, and it is necessary to
   coordinate the development of the two. This study quantitatively defined
   the evolutionary phases of the social-ecological system based on varying
   correlations among agricultural, socioeconomic, and ecological factors.
   Three different evolutionary phases have been identified in the
   development of oases in northwestern China since 2000. In the first
   phase, the groundwater supply increased with agricultural and
   socioeconomic development. The subsequent phase was characterized as the
   groundwater supply increased with faster agricultural development. In
   the final phase, the groundwater supply decreased in response to urban
   development improvements. As social factors such as population, economic
   growth, urbanization, and environmental protection became more reliant
   on groundwater, its contribution to groundwater depletion increased from
   8.37\% to 76.52\%, which further constrained grain production. The
   findings emphasized that groundwater allocation played a critical role
   in influencing the development mode of the oasis system. Achieving
   sustainable social-ecological development requires an integrated and
   systemic perspective that focuses on the tradeoff between food
   production, ecological security, water resource security and economic
   development.},

Abstract = {Ongoing urban expansion may degrade natural resources, ecosystems, and
   the services they provide to human societies, e.g., through land use and
   water changes and feedbacks. In order to control and minimize such
   negative impacts of urbanization, best practices for sustainable urban
   development must be identified, supported, and reinforced. To accomplish
   this, assessment methods and tools need to consider the couplings and
   feedbacks between social and ecological systems, as the basis for
   improving the planning and management of urban development.
   Collaborative efforts by academics, urban planners, and other relevant
   actors are also essential in this context. This will require relevant
   methods and tools for testing and projecting scenarios of coupled
   social-ecological system (CSES) behavior, changes, and feedbacks, in
   support of sustainable development of growing cities. This paper
   presents a CSES modeling approach that can provide such support, by
   coupling socio-economically driven land use changes and associated
   hydrological changes. The paper exemplifies and tests the applicability
   of this approach for a concrete case study with relevant data
   availability, the Tyresan catchment in Stockholm County, Sweden. Results
   show that model integration in the approach can reveal impacts of
   urbanization on hydrological and water resource, and the implications
   and feedbacks for urban societies and ecosystems. The CSES approach
   introduces new model challenges, but holds promise for improved model
   support towards sustainable urban development.},

   Iran},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {There is no certainty that adaptation to climate change is sustainable,
   and new approaches to assess current climate change adaptation
   trajectories are sorely needed. In this paper, we review the
   farmer-focused approaches (typical of vulnerability approaches) and
   agro-ecosystem-focused approaches (typical of resilience approaches). We
   propose that a combination of the two may be a better way to
   conceptualize sustainable adaptation to future climate change within an
   agro-ecological system. To test our hypothesis, we use the case study of
   Iran, a land that has shown both tremendous resilience and vulnerability
   in its agro-ecological system. We explore the changes that have occurred
   in the Iranian farming system and their implications for farmers'
   resilience to climate change through an integrated lens combining
   vulnerability approaches and resilience approaches. During the previous
   five decades, we describe how Iranian peasants have become small
   farmers, the land tenure system has changed from a traditional
   landlord-sharecropping system to family farms, and the quantity and
   quality of the agro-ecological resources have changed considerably. Our
   integrative approach provides important insights for both research and
   policy. We show that combining the two approaches can have far-reaching
   implications for farmers' adaptation to future climate change knowledge,
   policy, and practice since one approach aims to decrease farmers
   vulnerability and the other approach aims to build resilient
   agro-ecosystems.},

Title = {Iterative driver-response dynamics of human-environment interactions in
   the Arizona-Sonora borderlands},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In complex social-ecological systems, human and physical processes
   mutually condition one another through co-adaptation at multiple scales
   from the local to the global. For this paper we modified a
   driver-response conceptual model of social-ecological interactions by
   considering the degree to which each binary set of processes (human or
   physical) is simultaneously a driver and a response to global change.
   Processes that we understood to be mutually conditioned offered greater
   potential compared to solely social or ecological communities to adapt
   to demographic and economic change, on the one hand, and to climate,
   water resources, and ecosystems dynamics, on the other. By considering
   case material from the United States-Mexico border region, we
   characterized social-ecological interactions along a continuum from
   those acting exclusively as drivers to others reacting to change
   primarily as responses. We considered water resources to integrate
   multiple global change processes including climate change and
   variability, ecosystem resilience, and human water demands for a variety
   of purposes. Thus, we examined in detail two watersheds in the
   Arizona-Sonora borderlands representing mutually conditioned
   social-ecological systems. First, the Rio Magdalena in Sonora
   represented an illustrative case of smallholder agriculture and rural
   livelihoods engaged in social-ecological interaction that exhibited both
   driver and response elements centered on reflexive, low-impact adaptive
   strategies. Second, in Ambos Nogales relying on the Santa Cruz River and
   its associated aquifers, urban growth, the equity of water access for
   human purposes, and environmental quality represented especially
   pressing challenges. Here, human impacts on ecosystems were the
   predominant drivers although there was growing concern for the
   medium-and longer-term implications of climate change. Adaption planning
   in Ambos Nogales was centered on infrastructure-based solutions
   including an inter-basin water transfer connection with the Rio
   Magdalena. Wastewater flows to riparian corridors posed a particular
   challenge for human-environment interactions. Cross-border collaboration
   represents an important opportunity for adaptation based on the mutually
   conditioned interactions presented here. We summarized the analysis of
   both cases by raising conceptual questions for further enquiry and for
   adaptation and planning that are generic for the borderlands and beyond.},

Title = {Learning Dilemmas in a Social-Ecological System: An Agent-Based Modeling
   Exploration},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {The process of learning in social-ecological systems is an emerging area
   of research, but little attention has been given to how social and
   ecological interactions motivate or inhibit learning. This is highly
   relevant to the South African water sector, where a major policy
   transition is occurring that provides local water users and managers
   with new opportunities to engage in adaptive learning about how to
   balance human and ecological needs for water. In this paper, an
   agent-based model is used to explore potential `learning dilemmas', or
   barriers to learning in the South African water sector, whereby human
   perceptions combined with social-ecological conditions affect the
   capacity, understanding, and willingness required to learn. Agents
   manage water according to different management strategies and use
   various indicators to evaluate their success. The model shows that in
   areas with highly variable hydrological regimes, agents may be less able
   to learn because conditions are too unpredictable for them to benefit
   from past experience. Because of these changing conditions, however,
   agents are more likely to try new water management strategies, promoting
   a greater diversity of experience in the system for agents to learn from
   in the future. In water-stressed areas, where agents tend to have
   greater difficulty fulfilling demand for water than in areas with
   abundant water supplies, they are also more apt to try new strategies.
   When learning is restricted to small areas, agents may learn more
   quickly but based on a more narrow range of experience than in larger or
   more heterogeneous areas. These results suggest a need to enhance
   learning so that it accounts for interacting hydrological, ecological,
   and social dynamics. Although the model is a highly stylised version of
   reality, this preliminary exploration may eventually help to reverse the
   past trend of poor understanding of social-ecological dynamics as they
   relate to water management.},

Title = {Analyzing Stakeholder Perceptions of Water Ecosystem Services to Enhance
   Resilience in the Middle Draa Valley, Southern Morocco},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems deliver an extensive range of ecosystem services
   (ESs), which are the benefits people obtain from their interaction with
   nature. Increasing pressure on water resources threatens the sustainable
   supply of water-related ecosystem services, especially in arid regions,
   as is the case for the Draa Valley located in southern Morocco. With the
   long-term objective of contributing to a sustainable supply of important
   ecosystem services in the Draa Valley, this paper analyzes stakeholder
   perceptions of water-related ecosystem services (WESs). To assess the
   different perceptions of WES, 35 semi-structured interviews were
   conducted with the inhabitants of three oases in the middle Draa Valley,
   as well as 12 other interviews with key government officials. Based on
   our interviews, we reflect on two of the policy-relevant generic
   principles proposed by the Stockholm Resilience Centre for enhancing the
   resilience of WESs. Our results reveal similarities in perceptions of
   WES among stakeholder groups regarding provisioning services but marked
   differences regarding regulating and cultural services. The analysis
   suggests that these differences stem from stakeholders' different roles
   and activities in the area. In addition, socio-demographic, biophysical,
   and spatial aspects also shape how WESs are perceived in the area.
   Learning about similarities in WES perceptions can help build common
   ground among stakeholders. The recognition of differences can also
   assist the balancing of the different needs and interests of these
   groups. ESs perception assessment can contribute to strengthened
   stakeholder knowledge of the categories of ESs and provide a common
   ground for participating in ES-related decision making, hence enhancing
   resilience in social-ecological systems.},

Abstract = {Freshwater resource management is becoming increasingly complex as human
   pressure increases on available water resources, and as more
   participatory transparent decision-making frameworks are being advocated
   within water management. Complexity is further increased when
   environmental flow programs are integrated into existing water
   management programs. Adaptive management frameworks present an obvious
   choice for integration and implementation of environmental flows, but
   have so far failed to become the dominant framework. The research
   presented here highlights the ability of a strategic adaptive management
   (SAM) approach within an environmental flow program in the Murray
   Darling Basin of Australia to facilitate planning and implementation of
   environmental flows. The SAM approach did show that adaptive management
   can deal with the complexities of designing and implementing
   environmental flows within complex social-ecological systems, but can
   have limitations in the long-term. The approach highlighted the
   importance of social processes within adaptive management, emphasizing
   that a focus on inclusiveness, commitment, and transparency aimed at
   building understanding, trust, and ownership are key processes for
   implementation. In this specific case study, successful implementation
   was achieved through structured co-design of initial programs and
   participatory decision-making throughout. However, the SAM approach also
   showed that adaptive management is vulnerable to challenges in the
   long-term when resources and expertize change.},

Title = {Integrated environmental assessment to explore water resources
   management in Al Jabal Al Akhdar, Sultanate of Oman},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1345-1361},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Al Jabal Al Akhdar, an arid mountain region in northern Oman, has
   experienced rapid development over the last decades, resulting in the
   deterioration of water resources. This paper applies the driving
   force-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework as an integrated
   environmental assessment tool to illustrate the cause-and-effect
   relationships for sustainable management of water resources in the area.
   The research aimed to examine social and ecological aspects of mountain
   water to explore optimal approaches for sustainable use and management.
   The water resources are affected by increasing drivers of population
   growth and socio-economic development, through agriculture, tourism, and
   urbanization, exerting pressures through overconsumption of water,
   coupled with the exogenous pressure of climate change. The decreased
   rainfall and increased water demand have resulted in the degradation of
   water quantity and quality. The declining state of the water resources
   and reduced area of cultivation have resulted in considerable losses in
   agricultural income. The Omani government has adopted some responses,
   including water development projects, acting to reduce pressures as well
   as to improve the state of water resources. The DPSIR analysis indicates
   that trade-offs should be made between economic development and the
   continued supply of water for the agro-ecological system; choices could
   be in the prioritization of drivers. A dependence on desalinated water
   will introduce a reliance on a non-renewable external energy supply and
   is unlikely to ensure water supply at the multi-century timescale of the
   social-ecological system. In addition, tourism is predominantly based
   around the disappearing agro-ecosystems which in turn are dependent on
   the supply of water. Therefore, efforts should be directed towards
   improving water-use efficiency through installing modern irrigation
   technology, water conservation methods, use of greywater and treated
   wastewater, and rainwater harvesting as well as integrated water
   resources management, and climate change mitigation and adaptation
   measures.},

Title = {Social roles and performance of social-ecological systems: evidence from
   behavioral lab experiments},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Social roles are thought to play an important role in determining the
   capacity for collective action in a community regarding the use of
   shared resources. Here we report on the results of a study using a
   behavioral experimental approach regarding the relationship between
   social roles and the performance of social-ecological systems. The
   computer-based irrigation experiment that was the basis of this study
   mimics the decisions faced by farmers in small-scale irrigation systems.
   In each of 20 rounds, which are analogous to growing seasons,
   participants face a two-stage commons dilemma. First they must decide
   how much to invest in the public infrastructure, e.g., canals and water
   diversion structures. Second, they must decide how much to extract from
   the water made available by that public infrastructure. Each round
   begins with a 60-second communication period before the players make
   their investment and extraction decisions. By analyzing the chat
   messages exchanged among participants during the communication stage of
   the experiment, we coded up to three roles per participant using the
   scheme of seven roles known to be important in the literature: leader,
   knowledge generator, connector, follower, moralist, enforcer, and
   observer. Our study supports the importance of certain social roles
   (e.g., connector) previously highlighted by several case study analyses.
   However, using qualitative comparative analysis we found that none of
   the individual roles was sufficient for groups to succeed, i.e., to
   reach a certain level of group production. Instead, we found that a
   combination of at least five roles was necessary for success. In
   addition, in the context of upstream-downstream asymmetry, we observed a
   pattern in which social roles assumed by participants tended to differ
   by their positions. Although our work generated some interesting
   insights, further research is needed to determine how robust our
   findings are to different action situations, such as biophysical
   context, social network, and resource uncertainty.},

Abstract = {The resource management and environmental policy literature focuses on
   devising regulations and incentive structures to achieve desirable
   goals. It often presumes the existence of public infrastructure that
   actualizes these incentives and regulations through a process loosely
   referred to as `governance.' In many cases, it is not clear if and how
   such governance infrastructure can be created and supported. Here, we
   take a complex systems view in which `governance' is an emergent
   phenomenon generated by interactions between social, economic, and
   environmental (both built and natural) factors. We present a framework
   and formal stylized model to explore under what circumstances stable
   governance structures may emerge endogenously in coupled infrastructure
   systems comprising shared natural, social, and built infrastructures of
   which social-ecological systems are specific examples. The model allows
   us to derive general conditions for a sustainable coupled infrastructure
   system in which critical infrastructure (e.g., canals) is provided by a
   governing entity that enables resource users (e.g., farmers) to produce
   outputs from natural infrastructure (e.g., water) to meet their needs
   while supporting the governing entity.
   Plain Language Summary To understand how successful and robust
   governance may arise in coupled infrastructure systems comprising shared
   natural, social, and built infrastructure, we develop a stylized model
   based on a widely used conceptual framework that focuses on robustness
   of social-ecological systems. Analysis of the model results in
   conditions for sustainability of such systems that are expressed as
   clear relationships between biophysical and social factors. The results
   lay groundwork for more rigorous studies of robustness and resilience of
   these complex systems.},

Abstract = {Contrary to dominant paradigms, the river basin is not the obvious unit

   functions inherent in water resource management. The Southern African
   experience is presented to illustrate issues that may arise when using
   the river basin for different functions. Functions best addressed at a
   larger `problem-shed' level are identified and it is explained why some
   other functions should rather be performed at smaller, sub-basin scales.
   Using recent work on water governance, which emphasise polycentricity
   and network governance, it is suggested that a better understanding of
   the appropriate scales for different functions will support activities
   such as planning, monitoring and the protection of the aquatic
   environment that may best be focused at river basin scale.},

   social-ecological systems through linking ecological policy-household
   interactions with land surface dynamics},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {112},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As the Earth enters the Anthropocene, the system complexity and
   site-specificity of dryland social-ecological systems (SESs) presents
   new challenges for realizing the target of land degradation neutrality
   (LDN) in drylands. The valuable local environmental and scientific
   knowledge (LESK) of dryland SESs is crucial for adaptive governance but
   remains scarce. Here, we proposed an analytical framework to understand
   the LESK in relation to the mechanisms of ecological policy-household
   interactions and ecological performance of resource systems. According
   to this framework, we explored LESK by linking land surface dynamics and
   investigations of policy and households in a typical dryland region,
   Minqin. We reported that ecological policy contributed to significant
   socio-ecological benefits, including increased water resources, land
   desertification reduction, and natural vegetation restoration. However,
   there exist conflicting aspects, demonstrated by the encroachment of
   agricultural land, which increases the land degradation risk of oasis.
   These results implied that top-down ecological policy and bottom-up
   household responses caused both positive and negative LDN outcomes,
   which can be attributed to collective and conflicted actions between the
   self-interest orientation of multiple stakeholders. By investigating
   households, we found that education-induced economic need was one of the
   major drivers for the conflicted actions on the policy of agricultural
   land reduction. Therefore, we proposed a series of adaptive measurements
   to balance short-term economic concerns and long-term LDN. This study
   also highlighted that navigated LESK should be considered for future
   sustainable management and ecosystem modeling.},

Abstract = {Environmental changes caused by climate change in Alaska pose a serious
   threat to the food, energy and water systems that support the culturally
   diverse communities statewide. The fishing industry, watershed managers
   and other stakeholders struggle with understanding and predicting the
   rates, magnitude and location of changes occurring in their regions
   primarily because of the significant range of uncertainty inherent in
   these changes. With the guidance of stakeholders, we demonstrate a
   scenario analysis methodology to elucidate the interactions among
   various components and uncertainties within the food, energy and water
   systems of the Kenai River Watershed. Alternative scenario analysis
   provided stakeholders with a venue and process to consider plausible
   futures in which rates of change in critical uncertainties were modeled
   to elucidate potential responses. Critical uncertainties ranged from
   climatic impacts on freshwater systems, to new energy development
   proposals, to changes in sport and personal use fisheries. Working
   together, stakeholders developed narratives that reflected different
   combinations of future uncertainty to guide potential management actions
   now and in the future. Five scenarios were developed by stakeholders
   that capture the complex interactions in the Kenai River Watershed as a
   social-ecological system. This process provides a way for managers and
   stakeholders to plan for the future in a richer way than extrapolating
   trends for obvious drivers of change. We present this framework as a
   platform for integrating climate, landscape and cultural change data
   into actionable decisions, crafted by stakeholders, to improve future
   food, energy and water resource management at the watershed scale.},

Title = {Save water or save wildlife? Water use and conservation in the central
   Sierran foothill oak woodlands of California, USA},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {More frequent drought is projected for California. As water supplies
   constrict, and urban growth and out-migration spread to rural areas,
   trade-offs in water use for agriculture, biodiversity conservation, fire
   hazard reduction, residential development, and quality of life will be
   exacerbated. The California Black Rail (Laterallus jamaicensis
   coturniculus), state listed as ``Threatened,{''} depends on leaks from
   antiquated irrigation district irrigation systems for much of its
   remnant small wetland habitat in the north central Sierra Nevada
   foothills. Residents of the 1295 km(2) foothill habitat distribution of
   the Black Rail were surveyed about water use. Results show that the most
   Black Rail habitat is owned by those purchasing water to irrigate
   pasture, a use that commonly creates wetlands from leaks and tailwater.
   Promoting wildlife, agricultural production, and preventing wildfire are
   common resident goals that call for abundant and inexpensive water;
   social and economic pressures encourage reduction in water use and the
   repair of leaks that benefit wildlife and greenery. Broad inflexible
   state interventions to curtail water use are likely to create a
   multitude of unintended consequences, including loss of biodiversity and
   environmental quality, and alienation of residents as valued ecosystem
   services literally dry up. Adaptive and proactive policies are needed
   that consider the linkages in the social-ecological system, are
   sensitive to local conditions, prevent landscape dewatering, and
   recognize the beneficial use of water to support ecosystem services such
   as wildlife habitat. Much Black Rail habitat is anthropogenic, created
   at the nexus of local governance, plentiful water, agricultural
   practices, historical events, and changing land uses. This history
   should be recognized and leveraged rather than ignored in a rush to
   ``save{''} water by unraveling the social-ecological system that created
   the landscape. Policy and governance needs to identify and prioritize
   habitat areas to maintain during drought.},

Abstract = {A perfect storm refers to an event in which a rare combination of
   circumstances significantly exacerbates the event. River science faces a
   potential perfect storm through the emergence of several factors. First,
   pronounced and persistent human modifications to catchments and rivers
   have resulted in regime shifts-a state change of riverine landscapes.
   Anthropocene Rivers have different ecosystem structures and functions
   and cannot return to their ``natural state.{''} This new regime
   challenges accepted river science paradigms, especially those focused on
   traditional models of stressor-response. Second, river science is
   rapidly transitioning from a multidisciplinary activity focused on
   biophysical structures and functions, to rivers as social-ecological
   systems. The rise of interdisciplinary research not only recognizes the
   high degree of coupling between natural and human components, but also
   the generation of river knowledge that is more socially accountable.
   Third, the application of scientific knowledge to solve ``wicked{''}
   river problems continues. However, increasingly river managers are faced
   with decisions in an environment of high uncertainty about what they are
   managing, and the potential impacts of their actions. The manuscripts in
   this Special Issue highlight a potential perfect storm facing Australian
   riverine landscapes. The issue is dedicated to Professor Wayne Erskine;
   an intellectual leader of Australian river science for over 20 years.
   Focussed on the science and management of Australian Rivers, the 14
   manuscripts broadly cover the areas in which Wayne made his greatest
   contributions: river processes and management. Each has a strong
   foundation in theory and has application in helping to solve some of the
   complex problems faced by Australia's river managers across a range of
   spatial and temporal scales.},

Abstract = {Irrigation is key for agricultural production and public affairs in
   China. Canal irrigation has been the dominant form of irrigation in
   China for over two thousand years, but this is changing dramatically in
   contemporary China. Official government data and observational studies
   prove that canal irrigation has sharply declined in China in the past
   several decades. This paper explores the causes and influences
   associated with this decline. We use the social-ecological systems (SES)
   framework to diagnose the causes of the decline of canal irrigation and
   identify the significant influences on it. The broader contextual
   variables of industrialisation, urbanisation, policy, marketisation and
   technological progress influence resource systems, farmers and
   governance systems, which, in turn, have jointly led to the decline of
   canal irrigation. This study also considers the economic, social and
   ecological consequences of such a shift in irrigation pattern. The
   decline of canal irrigation may be inevitable in the transformation from
   a rural to a modern society. However, we must be aware of its costs and
   risks. To maintain the effectiveness of rural irrigation during the
   transformation to a modern society, we propose three implications of the
   decline of canal irrigation.},

Title = {Robustness, vulnerability, and adaptive capacity in small-scale
   social-ecological systems: The Pumpa Irrigation System in Nepal},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Change in freshwater availability is arguably one of the most pressing
   issues associated with global change. Agriculture, which uses roughly
   70\% of the total global freshwater supply, figures prominently among
   sectors that may be adversely affected by global change. Of specific
   concern are small-scale agricultural systems that make up nearly 90\% of
   all farming systems and generate 40\% of agricultural output worldwide.
   These systems are experiencing a range of novel shocks, including
   increased variability in precipitation and competing demands for water
   and labor that challenge their capacity to maintain agricultural output.
   This paper employs a robustness-vulnerability trade-off framework to
   explore the capacity of these small-scale systems to cope with novel
   shocks and directed change. Motivated by the Pumpa Irrigation System in
   Nepal, we develop and analyze a simple model of rice-paddy irrigation
   and use it to demonstrate how institutional arrangements may, in
   becoming very well tuned to cope with specific shocks and manage
   particular human interactions associated with irrigated agriculture,
   generate vulnerabilities to novel shocks. This characterization of
   robustness-vulnerability trade-off relationships is then used to inform
   policy options to improve the capacity of small-scale irrigation systems
   to adapt to changes in freshwater availability.},

Title = {A review of the social-ecological systems framework: applications,
   methods, modifications, and challenges},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The social-ecological systems framework (SESF) is arguably the most
   comprehensive conceptual framework for diagnosing interactions and
   outcomes in social-ecological systems (SES). This article systematically
   reviews the literature applying and developing the SESF and discusses
   methodological challenges for its continued use and development. Six
   types of research approaches using the SESF are identified, as well as
   the context of application, types of data used, and commonly associated
   concepts. The frequency of how each second-tier variable is used across
   articles is analyzed. A summary list of indicators used to measure each
   second-tier variable is provided. Articles suggesting modifications to
   the framework are summarized and linked to the specific variables. The
   discussion reflects on the results and focuses on methodological
   challenges for applying the framework. First, how the SESF is
   historically related to commons and collective action research. This
   affects its continued development in relation to inclusion criteria for
   variable modification and discourse in the literature. The framework may
   evolve into separate modified versions for specific resource use sectors
   (e.g., forestry, fisheries, food production, etc.), and a general
   framework would aggregate the generalizable commonalities between them.
   Methodological challenges for applying the SESF are discussed related to
   research design, transparency, and cross-case comparison. These are
   referred to as ``methodological gaps{''} that allow the framework to be
   malleable to context but create transparency, comparability, and data
   abstraction issues. These include the variable-definition gap,
   variable-indicator gap, the indicator-measurement gap, and the data
   transformation gap. A benefit of the framework has been its ability to
   be malleable and multipurpose, bringing a welcomed pluralism of methods,
   data, and associated concepts. However, pluralism creates challenges for
   synthesis, data comparison, and mutually agreed-upon methods for
   modifications. Databases are a promising direction forward to help solve
   this problem. In conclusion, future research is discussed by reflecting
   on the different ways the SESF may continue to be a useful tool through
   (1) being a general but adaptable framework, (2) enabling comparison,
   and (3) as a diagnostic tool for theory building.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses the integration of hydrology with other disciplines
   using an Integrated Assessment (IA) and modelling approach to the
   management and allocation of water resources. Recent developments in the
   field of socio-hydrology aim to develop stronger relationships between
   hydrology and the human dimensions of Water Resource Management (WRM).
   This should build on an existing wealth of knowledge and experience of
   coupled human water systems. To further strengthen this relationship and
   contribute to this broad body of knowledge, we propose a strong and
   durable ``marriage{''} between IA and hydrology. The foundation of this
   marriage requires engagement with appropriate concepts, model
   structures, scales of analyses, performance evaluation and communication
   and the associated tools and models that are needed for pragmatic
   deployment or operation. To gain insight into how this can be achieved,
   an IA case study in water allocation in the Lower Namoi catchment, NSW,
   Australia is presented.},

Abstract = {The European Alps are known as the `water towers of Europe'. However,
   climatic and socioeconomic changes influence both water supply and
   demand, increasing the need to manage this limited and valuable resource
   properly to avoid user conflicts and water scarcity. Two major
   challenges emerge when assessing water scarcity in the Alps: Firstly,
   mountainous regions are very heterogeneous regarding water availability
   and demand over space and time, and therefore water scarcity assessments
   need to be done at low temporal and spatial scales. Secondly, the tight
   coupling of the natural and the social sphere necessitate an integrative
   approach considering dynamics and interactions of the social-ecological
   system. Hence, we applied the agent-based water supply and demand model
   Aqua.MORE, which is designed for catchment scale and sub-daily temporal
   resolution, to a case study site in the Italian Alps. In the model, the
   water supply, the local water managers and water users are represented
   by interacting model agents. We estimated the water supply by refining
   the annual runoff data provided by the InVEST water yield model for
   within-year variations. Local stakeholders contributed to the
   development of quantitative and spatially-explicit scenarios for land
   use and tourism evolution. To evaluate water supply and demand dynamics,
   we assessed six scenarios for the period of 2015 to 2050: three
   different socio-economic policy pathways, both alone and in combination
   with a climate change scenario. In all six scenarios, the water
   demand:supply (D:S) ratio continuously rises from 2015 to 2050. The
   highest D:S ratio values are prognosed at the beginning of the
   irrigation period in May. In all scenarios considering climatic changes,
   the D:S ratio exceeds 20\% for several days, indicating potential water
   scarcity. The simulation results reinforce the importance of analysing
   water balances at a high temporal resolution and can support management
   processes and stakeholder dialogues for sustainable watershed
   management. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Is it because of climate change? Social-ecological system analysis of
   wetland protected area in Vietnamese Mekong Delta},
Journal = {WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {33-57},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Wetland protected areas (WPA) are among the most productive natural
   environments, providing substantial socio-economic benefits to humans as
   well as habitats for numerous species. However, they are also highly
   vulnerable in the Anthropocene era due to various factors, such as
   population growth, unsustainable production, and climate change.
   Assessing the land cover change of WPA and its driving forces is
   necessary work for the sustainable development and management of WPA.
   Here, we investigated vegetation as an indicator for land cover changes
   in WPA because of its strong interaction with the governance system and
   external related ecosystems of WPA, such as water resources and nutrient
   cycles. Along with the change in vegetation, we examined how climate
   change contributes to WPA change and human management. With the
   complexity of the research tasks, a social-ecological system (SES)
   approach was applied with three main elements: the resource system
   (vegetation covers), external related ecosystems (climate change), and
   governance system (wetland management) and their interactions through
   ecological performance (outcome). We contribute to the lack of temporary
   SES research in the coverage of External Related Ecosystems in relation
   to Resource systems and Governance systems. The selected site is the
   first Ramsar site of Vietnam's Mekong Delta-Tram Chim National Park
   (TCNP), which is located at the exit of the Mekong River flowing into
   Vietnam's territory. The study used a mixed methodology with the
   Mann-Kendall rank test, Theil-Sen estimative method, and the
   Mann-Whitney-Pettit method to analyze trends in climate parameters from
   1978 to 2019. Additionally, the wetland vegetation changes were detected
   through the analysis of satellite images based on the Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from 2002 to 2020. We also used
   Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) and carried
   out a desk review of local reports and previous research for the local
   disaster timeline and governance system. The results show that the
   climate in TCNP has significantly changed, with an increase in both
   temperature and rainfall during the dry season. However, a decrease in
   NDVI dynamics and an extension of the lowland vegetation community
   dominate the trends of spatio-temporal change in vegetation. With the
   SES approach, we indicated that climate change is not the main driver
   but is always perceived as an increased risk for biodiversity
   conservation of WPA. Consequently, maladaptive actions and regulations
   from the governance system have been implemented, which can threaten the
   sustainable development of WPA. Therefore, this study contributes to a
   more comprehensive viewpoint on the conservation and adaptive management
   of WPA.},

Title = {Collective action as a tool for agri-environmental policy
   implementation. The case of diffuse pollution control in European rural
   areas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {280},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {In the European Union (EU) context, regulatory instruments and incentive
   schemes targeting individual farms remain the main policy instruments
   implemented to control diffuse pollution from agriculture. Yet,
   collective approaches to policy implementation have been recently
   developing. This article aims at assessing the potential for hybrid
   policy instruments relying on collective action among farmers to limit
   diffuse nitrate pollution from agriculture. Transaction cost economics
   are used to assess the potential advantages of collective action as a
   complement to regulatory and incentive policy tools. The conditions
   under which such hybrid forms of governance may be successful are
   identified using the Social-Ecological System (SES) framework. A review
   of empirical studies documenting cases of collective action for policy
   implementation in the EU context serves as a basis for the
   identification of the factors likely to affect the potential of
   collective approaches for water quality management in agriculture. The
   analysis relies more particularly on two cases: the Environmental
   Cooperatives in the Netherlands and the ``Ferti-Mieux{''} operations in
   France. The results suggest that collective action is a relevant tool to
   consider for improving the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
   policies targeting diffuse pollution from agriculture. In particular,
   relying on farmers' cooperation for policy implementation may be
   associated with advantages in terms of transaction costs. However, such
   advantages will be effective under a number of conditions related to the
   characteristics of the water resource, the actors involved, the
   governance of cooperation and the broader economic and institutional
   contexts.},

Title = {Understanding of water resilience in the Anthropocene},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Water is indispensable for Earth resilience and sustainable development.
   The capacity of social-ecological systems to deal with shocks, adapting
   to changing conditions and transforming in situations of crisis are
   fundamentally dependent on the functions of water to e.g., regulate the
   Earth's climate, support biomass production, and supply water resources
   for human societies. However, massive, inter-connected, human
   interference involving climate forcing, water withdrawal, dam
   constructions, and land-use change have significantly disturbed these
   water functions and induced regime shifts in social-ecological systems.
   In many cases, changes in core water functions have pushed systems
   beyond tipping points and led to fundamental shifts in system feedback.
   Examples of such transgressions, where water has played a critical role,
   are collapse of aquatic systems beyond water quality and quantity
   thresholds, desertification due to soil and ecosystem degradation, and
   tropical forest dieback associated with self-amplifying moisture and
   carbon feedbacks. Here, we aggregate the volumes and flows of water
   involved in water functions globally, and review the evidence of
   freshwater related linear collapse and non-linear tipping points in
   ecological and social systems through the lens of resilience theory.
   Based on the literature review, we synthesize the role of water in
   mediating different types of ecosystem regime shifts, and generalize the
   process by which life support systems are at risk of collapsing due to
   loss of water functions. We conclude that water plays a fundamental role
   in providing social-ecological resilience, and suggest that further
   research is needed to understand how the erosion of water resilience at
   local and regional scale may potentially interact, cascade, or amplify
   through the complex, globally hyper-connected networks of the
   Anthropocene. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

   appropriators, i.e. intruders. New external disturbances that increase
   the physical and socio-political accessibility of SES (e.g. construction

   common-pool resources are some of the main factors that enhance the
   encroachment of intruders. The irrigation system of the northwest Murcia
   Region (Spain) is an example used in this article of the changes in the
   structure and robustness of a traditional SES as a result of intruders.
   In this case study, farmers have traditionally used water from springs
   to irrigate their lands but, in recent decades, large agrarian companies
   have settled in this region, using groundwater to irrigate new lands.
   This intrusion had caused the levels of this resource to drop sharply.
   In an attempt to adapt, local communities are intensifying the use of
   resources and are constructing new physical infrastructures;
   consequently, new vulnerabilities are emerging. This situation seems to
   be heading toward the inevitably collapse of this traditional SES. From
   an institutional viewpoint, some recommendations are offered to enhance
   the robustness of SES in order to mitigate the consequences of

Abstract = {Modeling coupled social and biophysical dynamics of water resources
   systems is increasingly important due to population growth and changes
   in the water cycle driven by climate change. Models that explicitly
   represent these coupled dynamics are challenging to design and
   implement, particularly given the complicated and cross-scale nature of
   water governance. Agent-based models (ABMs) can capture human
   decision-making and nested social hierarchies, however, transferability
   is made difficult by location-specific details. A consistent description
   of water resources decision-makers (individuals, groups, agencies) would
   advance the rate of model development and increase synthesis across
   systems. Reviewing water resources ABMs, we propose eight agent types
   and associated operational roles that modify the storage,
   redistribution, and water use in a system. Application of the proposed
   typologies and use of best practices in model documentation, will
   support systematic design and development of transferable, scalable,
   water resources ABMs and facilitate the dynamic coupling of social and
   biophysical process modeling.},

Abstract = {In social-ecological systems, natural resource management can be
   characterized by trade-offs across sectors andsustainability targets.
   The water-energy-food (WEF) nexus concept makes explicit various
   trade-offs in order to maximize synergies ofinterventions. However,
   there are few successful examples of its operationalization in research
   settings. Here, we explore in a learningsetting if sustainability impact
   assessment (SIA) protocols can be a useful process to be used to adopt a
   systemic, interdisciplinaryperspective to operationalize WEF nexus in
   research for sustainable development. The process and method adopted of
   SIA protocol,evaluated for five exemplary WEF nexus cases in Central
   Asia during a week-long international workshop, adequately addressed
   thecomplexity of WEF interrelationships and associated sustainability
   issues, and facilitated a comparative case study analysis acrossscales.
   Results within this process highlight that water governance was critical
   for large-scale transboundary WEF nexus management,while land and soil
   management were decisive for minimizing trade-offs at local levels.
   Issues of interdisciplinarity, complexity,uncertainty, and reflection on
   impacts were adequately addressed, but challenges remain in the
   consideration of ethics and the designof transparent, multi-actor
   cooperation. Most importantly, this exercise showed that employment of
   the process of SIA protocolsupported disciplinary experts to work across
   disciplines and take a systemic approach for analyzing WEF nexus.},

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Water resource governance, much like the systems it endeavors to manage,
   must be resilient and adaptive. Effective, resilient and adaptive water
   resource governance requires continuing stakeholder engagement to
   address the complex nature of human and natural systems. Engagement is
   an adaptive and iterative process of education and empowerment, building
   relationships and trust, and facilitating collaboration. Collaborative
   modeling is a methodology that integrates diverse stakeholder
   perspectives, fosters discussions, and creates space for problem
   identification and consensus-based strategies and solutions to current
   water resource challenges. We define collaborative modeling broadly,
   such that it includes a wide range of systems thinking exercises, as
   well as dynamic models. By focusing on the relationships and
   interconnections in the system, collaborative modeling facilitates
   clarification of mental models and the communication of science. We will
   describe our work in two interstate basins and how it has evolved over
   time as these basins strive to develop collaborative governance, and
   find solutions for their water resource challenges.},

Abstract = {The management of Lake Okeechobee in Florida has undergone significant
   changes in the last decade. Socio-political, environmental and
   demographic factors have driven changes in the environmental and water
   policy, which in turn have led to wide-ranging institutional changes and
   a shift toward multiobjective planning and implementation in the Lake
   management. This article describes the changes in the philosophy and
   practice of water resources management in South Florida hydrologic
   system, of which Lake Okeechobee is a crucial component. The impacts of
   the changes on management goals and decision processes are illustrated
   through a case study of the use of climate information in Lake
   management. The article concludes with a brief examination of the
   implications of the institutional changes, including greater public
   participation, for the long-term sustainability of the social-ecological

Title = {Water Governance in Mediterranean Farming Systems through the
   Social-Ecological Systems Framework-An Empirical Case in Southern
   Portugal},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Water governance is a major challenge in the Mediterranean context. Any
   action to drive water governance towards sustainability needs to be
   grounded in a holistic understanding of such challenges. Therefore, a
   first step towards the improvement of water governance is a grounded
   understanding of what is at stake, who are the actors involved, and how
   they interact. To achieve this level of understanding, we propose the
   use of the social-ecological Systems (SES) framework. This framework was
   developed to grasp the complexity of issues related to the sustainable
   use of public goods such as water. This study looks at water governance
   in the farming sector of three municipalities in the Alentejo and
   Algarve, in the south of Portugal. Data were collected using a
   literature review and 22 semi-structured interviews with territorial
   actors (i.e., public administration, non-governmental associations,
   private sector, decision-makers, and farmers). By using the SES
   framework, we provide an integrated characterization of water governance
   in the case study and identify the implicated factors. Between these
   factors, and focusing on the overlap between literature and actors'
   perspectives, are (1) the lack of integrated and supported strategies
   for development, and (2) lack of communication between the actors that
   need to congregate efforts towards sustainable use of water resources.
   The study found few examples of collective efforts and long-lasting
   networks of collaboration, especially between science and practice. We
   conclude by arguing that place-based tailored policies are needed. Such
   policies should promote communication and collective actions between
   researchers, local organizations, public administration, and farmers.},

Title = {Spatio-temporal dynamics of climate change, land degradation, and water
   insecurity in an arid rangeland: The Rio San Miguel watershed, Sonora,
   Mexico},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {193},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Rangelands are complex social-ecological systems (SES) commonly used to
   support ranching and other agrarian livelihoods. Common to Earth's
   drylands, rangelands are susceptible to drought, desertification, and
   land degradation from both climatic and human activities. In the arid
   Americas, ranching communities are often located in watersheds and rely
   on local riparian resources (e.g. surface- and ground-water) to support
   crop and animal cultivation. However, anthropogenic climate change in
   combination with intensified agriculture integrated into international
   markets degrade both landscape and water resources. In Sonora, Mexico's
   Rio San Miguel Watershed we find via an interdisciplinary set of methods
   that rangeland productivity, surface-water reaches, and aquifers are
   reduced to critical levels, agrarian livelihoods endangered, and within
   this dynamic, that downstream locations are less resilient and water
   secure than operations upstream. This spatio-temporal dynamic to water
   insecurity is due both to (a) latitudinal-based climatic changes and (b)
   upstream groundwater pumping activity. Participatory rapid rural
   appraisal, agro-ecosystem analysis, and remote sensing tell us how
   climate, landscape, water, and ranching operation dynamics are
   interrelated and affect SES morphology and resilience across time,
   operations, and sub-watersheds. Partnerships and cooperation among
   ranchers, subwatersheds, and institutions are among the management and
   policy interventions available to prepare for or mitigate the developing
   social-ecological crisis in the watershed. Lessons from Mexico's Rio San
   Miguel Watershed are relevant for other drylands, agrarian systems, and
   groundwater-reliant economies, especially as the specter of long-term
   global climate change and water insecurity looms large for many of the
   Earth's socialecological systems.},

Abstract = {Encouragement of learning is considered to be central to resilience of
   social-ecological systems (SESs) to unknown and unforeseeable shocks.
   However, despite the consensus on the centrality of learning, little
   research has been done on the details of how learning should be
   encouraged to enhance adaptive capacity for resilience. This study
   contributes to bridging this research gap by examining the existing data
   from a behavioral experiment on SES that involves learning. We generate
   new hypotheses regarding how learning should be encouraged by comparing
   the learning processes of human-subject groups that participated in the
   experiment. Our findings suggest that under environmental stability,
   groups may be able to perform well without frequent outer-loop (or
   double-loop) learning. They can still succeed as long as they tightly
   coordinate on shared strategies along with active monitoring of SESs and
   user participation in decision-making. However, such groups may be
   fragile under environmental variability. Only the groups that experience
   active outer-loop learning and monitoring of SESs are likely to remain
   resilient under environmental variability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Hydrological changes due to climate change will impact the
   sustainability of social-ecological systems (SES). It is essential to
   develop methodologies, capable of addressing economic as well as the
   environmental aspects, to take care of the water-associated system
   through improving the system adaptive capacity, particularly in arid and
   semi-arid areas. Through the application of the Post-Modern Portfolio
   Theory (PMPT), we propose a new approach to water allocation problem in
   the face of climate change, as a case of Lake Tashk-Bakhtegan basin,
   Southern Iran. The economic model based on PMPT is adapted for designing
   water allocation schemes to maximize local economic return, minimize its
   risk and minimize the Gini coefficient indicative of social inequities.
   The climatic variables were generated by three Atmosphere-Ocean General
   Circulation Models. The temperature and precipitation will increase and
   decrease by about +2.4\% and -10\% on average in the future compared to
   those in the historical period, respectively. In order to identify
   hydrological and socio-economic implications of climate change in the
   basin, an integrated system dynamic model was developed. Finally, the
   decision space of equally effective solutions has been determined in the
   form of Pareto points at the efficient portfolio plane. The findings
   showed a decrease in the economic return (on average by 5.7\% in the
   both RCPs) and the ratio of employment to unemployment (average 10\% in
   most of sub-basin), owing to the reduction of water resources,
   especially in agriculture. Base on Portfolio results, the ratio of
   economic return to risk doubled and tripled in optimized condition
   compared to the normal condition in the future. The efficient plane of
   the portfolio can be used to allocate water to economic activities
   according to a risk-taking attitude of a decision-maker. Following the
   model results, services and industrial sectors would need to be
   developed in order to sustain local water resources with possible
   additional allocations for environmental requirements, with simultaneous
   improvement of economic return on water resources. (C) 2018 Published by

Title = {Governance of alluvial aquifers and community participation: a
   social-ecological systems analysis of the Brazilian semi-arid region},

Abstract = {Small and shallow alluvial aquifers in arid and semi-arid regions
   compose an important water system that smallholder farmers rely on for
   irrigation and livestock feeding. Geological settings and the small
   scale of these aquifers suggest the need for governance at the local
   level, but research supporting its development is still scarce. Treating
   a case of alluvial aquifers exploited by smallholder farmers located in
   the Brazilian semi-arid region as a common pool resource (CPR), this
   paper analyses the governance of a social-ecological system (SES) for
   which an alluvial aquifer is an essential source of water. The paper
   applies the SES Framework to analyse the SES in light of Ostrom's
   principles for sustainable CPR management to answer the questions: (1)
   can the governance arrangements support sustainable common pool resource
   management of the alluvial aquifers? (2) what opportunities are there to
   make the management of the aquifer more sustainable through
   community-based governance? (3) can Ostrom's design principles lead the
   transition to more sustainable governance of alluvial aquifers? Despite
   a water policy aiming for decentralisation and participatory governance,
   gaps in the implementation of these policies are identified. Taking into
   account the challenges imposed by the aquifer characteristics to impact
   efficient groundwater exploitation, equity in water distribution and
   conservation of the CPR, the analysis reveals opportunities to improve
   CPR management by supporting the community to increase participation in
   the governance of the aquifer in coordination with existing policies.
   This work concludes with suggestions that could empower community
   progress towards more sustainable governance of the aquifer.},

Journal = {BODY MOVEMENT AND DANCE IN PSYCHOTHERAPY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 17},
Abstract = {This research study is an initial exploration of ways in which
   principles of dance movement therapy practice can be used in South
   Africa. Culturally-relevant principles in dance movement therapy
   practice were identified in an earlier phase of the study and informed a
   short-term group intervention within a transdisciplinary research team
   that dealt with water resources management. The research question for
   this phase of the study focused on the experiences of members of this
   group: How did researchers from a water resources management
   transdisciplinary environmental research group program in South Africa
   experience their participation in a group that adopted selected,
   culturally-sensitive dance movement therapy principles and practices?
   Hermeneutic phenomenology provided the methodological framing.
   Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis influenced the identification
   of themes. We conclude that principles of dance movement therapy have
   relevance in multiple and diverse ways within environmental
   transdisciplinary teams, beyond typical therapy contexts.},

Abstract = {Transboundary Risk' and its management are widely acknowledged concepts,
   real-world problems and policy challenges preoccupying the fields of
   geography, sociology, political science, management and disaster
   studies. Up to the present, the notion of boundary' in the study and
   management of transboundary risks principally refers to national
   borders, whereas other important boundaries, such as the physical
   boundaries of drainage basins, the boundaries of social-ecological
   systems (SESs) or the lines separating public from private space, are
   rarely considered with respect to their penetration by risk dynamics.
   Resilience has been acknowledged in the case of SESs as an operation
   appealing to various spatial and temporal scales for access to vital
   resources. However, the spatio-temporal boundaries which are surpassed
   or penetrated in the process of transition from one scale to another is
   an unexplored issue. The authors focus their attention on a specific
   type of SESs, the social-hydrological systems (SHSs), facing the stress
   (risk) of water scarcity or drought, and assume that resilience of SHSs
   may be a process of attraction of water resources from other, probably
   distant SHSs. This type of resilience which transfers vulnerability
   might be termed trans-boundary resilience because it necessitates the
   breaking of boundaries and the spatial transformation of SHSs. This view
   considers resilience as a transboundary and trans-scalar dynamic process
   facilitating resource transfer and unveils its spatial dimension as well
   as its ethical and normative aspects. These assumptions are empirically
   confirmed in a range of water scarcity and drought problems, which are
   the following: (a) cities relying on water transfer from distant river
   basins; (b) agricultural populations and holdings facing drought and
   relying on a shared aquifer; and (c) arid islands. Whether this type of
   resilience is valid in other SES cases and other types of risk, is a
   matter of future research.},

Title = {Operationalizing the social-ecological systems framework in pond
   aquaculture},

Pages = {485-518},
Abstract = {This study develops and applies an interdisciplinary and mixed method
   approach to operationalize the social-ecological systems (SES) framework
   in the context of aquaculture, the fastest growing food production
   sector worldwide. We apply this methodology to conduct a case study of
   community-based pond aquaculture on the island of Lombok, West Nusa
   Tenggara, Indonesia. This diagnostic approach demonstrates how
   sustainability challenges are interrelated at multiple levels through an
   analysis applying common-pool resource (CPR) and collective action
   theories. At the community level, qualitative data show how pond
   aquaculture systems can have CPR dilemmas, requiring communities to work
   together to solve them. We show how a provision dilemma manifests from
   the need to maintain common canal infrastructure to distribute water to
   private ponds. Asymmetric incentives to contribute exist because there
   are up and downstream users in the pond network, similar to some
   irrigation systems. Second, at the level of individual ponds, we
   developed indicators for the Resource System, Resource Unit, Governance
   and Actor tiers of the SES framework. Indicator data for each pond was
   measured and transformed into normalized quantitative scores to examine
   the relationships between social and ecological outcomes within and
   between ponds. We combine the results of our multi-level analysis to
   discuss the broader social-ecological relationships which link
   collective action challenges in managing common canal infrastructure
   with pond level outcomes and current government policies for advancing
   community development. We emphasize the need for increased knowledge and
   training on effective aquaculture practice as an underlying driver of
   current system conditions. This study raises many methodological
   challenges associated with designing empirically based SES research and
   building SES theory. We discuss challenges with integrating diverse data
   types, indicator selection and making normative assumptions about
   sustainability.},

Title = {Assessing Action Situation Networks: A Configurational Perspective on
   Water and Energy Governance in Irrigation Systems},
Journal = {WATER ECONOMICS AND POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1, SI},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The action situation is a core component of actor-centered institutional
   analysis of natural resource governance. Institutional analysis
   frameworks have been extended to observe multiple situations structured
   into networks. If further operationalized, this extension can improve
   policy diagnosis of human-environmental interactions. This paper
   proposes two complementary ways to move in that direction. First, we
   propose the use of qualitative configurational analysis and game theory
   to study the interactions between situations and assess the contribution
   of each to a desired outcome. Second, we draw on centrality measures to
   assess the benefits and risks of implementing policies that aim to
   change the equilibria in action situations. Both analytical strategies
   are applied to two cases involving irrigation and energy governance. In
   the Spanish case, centrality of the water allocation situation justifies
   a configuration of drought measures that also tackle cooperation in
   monitoring and infrastructure maintenance. In the Indian case,
   groundwater governance and adequate infrastructure capacity provision
   are necessary preconditions to enable coordinated technology adoption,
   which facilitates incentives for regulated irrigation. In both the
   cases, some action situations' positive outcomes are necessary in every
   configuration to guarantee optimal equilibria in the network. In the
   context of energy-fed irrigation systems, the proposed analytical
   strategies permit integrating interactions between water use, energy use
   and food production decisions in policy diagnoses. The analysis can be
   extended to identify archetypes, network closure, as well as structural
   and functional connectivity of networks in social-ecological systems.},

Abstract = {Under what conditions are irrigators able to develop adaptive governance
   arrangements? This article addresses this question by developing an
   empirically grounded theory of self-governance of a snowmelt commons in
   southern Colorado. Drawing on previous work in collective action and
   institutional theory, we argue that self-regulation of the hydro-commons
   is driven by changes in shared user perceptions with regard to the
   salience and scarcity of the resource, as well as the perceived
   probability of salvaging the resource system. We further posit that
   several conditioning factors affect the likelihood of effective local
   responses, including the existing institutional arrangements for
   self-governance, techno-institutional complementarities, and vested
   interests. We test and refine our theoretical argument by conducting a
   historical analysis of regional responses to hydrologic, social, and
   institutional disturbances in Colorado's San Luis Valley.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {150},
Pages = {378-386},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Fragmented jurisdictions and decision making structures can result in
   destructive competition and/or a lack of systematic cooperation that can
   hamper effective resource management and environmental planning,
   although the value of local autonomy and stakeholder participations
   should not be underestimated. This study empirically examines if
   political fragmentation in local governance is a significant barrier to
   successful resource management. To test this hypothesis, the authors
   quantify the degree of political fragmentation at two different
   geographical scales - 1) site-level: 12-digit watersheds and 2)
   regional: metropolitan statistical areas or equivalent regions - and
   analyze how water resource management outcomes vary with the level of
   political fragmentation using nationwide land cover and stream gauge
   information in the U.S. Regression analysis shows water quality declines
   (or slower quality improvements), measured in terms of total suspended
   solids, are associated with both site-level and regional political
   fragmentation indicators, suggesting that political fragmentation can
   make resource management more challenging. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Smallholders' decisions on land use and their activities and strategies
   of livelihoods are the critical source of uncertainty in natural
   resource use and an essential determinant of sustainability challenges.
   This data article provides a selection of quantitative data from a
   questionnaire survey on livelihood assets, activities and outcomes of
   smallholder farm households in Yan'he Township, which lies in the middle
   part of China's Loess Plateau, one of the representative Grain for Green
   Project areas {[}1]. Data include land-use decisions and agronomic
   practices, fertilisation, use of pesticides, machine and irrigation,
   farm and non-farm activities, financial performance, and the levels of
   household income, wellness, and total consumption of food, energy, and
   education and health care. The survey also covered geographical,
   demographic and socioeconomic background information on the respondents
   and their perceptions, incentives, propensities and subjective
   wellbeing. The survey has supported a couple of research articles that
   build indicators and indexes for economic, environmental and
   socio-cultural sustainability dimensions and the resilience building of
   coupled social-ecological systems. The data presented in this article
   were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics and provided
   at the Mendeley Repository. The data will assist studies on the
   interrelationships of smallholder livelihoods, ecosystem conservation,
   interventionist policy and market support, and community capacity
   building in sustainability science. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by

Abstract = {We observe a paradigm shift toward collaborative, multi-level (from
   local to global) water management and suggestions for scale-related
   design principles in the literature. Decision-support tools are needed
   that can help achieve scale design principles. Mediated modeling (MM)
   refers to model building with people, rather than for people. This tool
   belongs to a family of participatory, systems oriented tools. This
   article explores their suitability for addressing challenges and
   principles that arise at multiple-scales. MM can promote the
   understanding of cross-level and cross-scale links, creating salient,
   credible, and legitimate knowledge and encouraging boundary functions.
   Prerequisites for successful MM processes include an openness and
   willingness to collaborative learning. As new meso-level institutions
   emerge to address complex challenges in water management
   collaboratively, tools like MM may play an important role in structuring
   dialogues, developing adaptive management capacity and advance an
   ecosystem services approach.},

   adaptation to water scarcity under climate change in the Murray-Darling
   Basin, Australia},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},

Abstract = {Climate change has increased the variability of river inflows in the
   Murray-Darling Basin, threatening the viability of irrigated
   agriculture, food processing industries and ecological condition of
   wetlands. With increasing water scarcity, decision-makers and
   communities face heightened contestation over scarce water resources and
   trade-offs and adaptation have become increasingly necessary. We used a
   social-ecological systems approach to identify thresholds of change in
   the Goulburn-Broken Catchment, a major food-producing region, to reveal
   options for adaptation to climate change. We developed systems models
   whereby feedbacks are identified between sub-systems of cultural
   paradigms, policies, human well-being and environmental condition.
   Models were constructed using data from semi-structured interviews with
   managers and decision-makers, industry reports and the scientific
   literature. We found environmental thresholds are fixed, but whether
   they are exceeded is socially determined. Environmental condition can be
   maintained by relaxing constraints on volumes of water released into the
   highly regulated river system and easing rules on the distribution of
   water among users in the dairy and horticulture industries.
   Socio-economic thresholds were more flexible. Industries have adapted to
   water scarcity through irrigation efficiency measures, inter-industry
   relationships for water-sharing and feed substitutes in dairy
   production. However, industry interdependence indicates potential for
   maladaption, whereas investment in adaptation and diversification offers
   more sustainable options. Current policy and management disconnects
   between water for the environment and water for food production reveal
   opportunities for co-benefits between environmental and socio-economic
   domains. Realising these benefits requires a systemic, inclusive
   adaptation pathways approach to design and implement options for change.},

   as decision-support tools; provided a forum for relationship and trust
   building; shared information; and co-generated knowledge. Difficult
   challenges became opportunities for collaborative learning by doing. The

   Atlantic Bluefin Tuna},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {277-303},
Abstract = {The need to understand how to sustainably govern oceanic fisheries has
   become increasingly urgent as their contribution to global food security
   and livelihoods are threatened by declining stocks. Atlantic Bluefin
   Tuna (ABFT) is a prominent example of the complexities associated with
   widely distributed oceanic resources, extending in this case to include
   much of the North-Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. This distribution has
   led to limited attention from commons theorists that tend to focus on
   small-scale social ecological systems. Therefore in order to explore the
   fit between theories of the commons developed in small-scale systems, we
   apply the Social-Ecological Systems Meta-Analysis Database (SESMAD) to
   systematically analyze ABFT governance over a 22 year period. The
   results, which focus on the effects of resource characteristics, broadly
   correspond to the expectations of commons theory. Interestingly,
   however, the addition of resource storage in the form of ABFT ranches
   appears to be contributing to unsustainable harvests. This stands in
   contrast to previous findings in the commons literature that storage
   tends to enhance prospects for sustainable governance. Therefore several
   alternative hypotheses are developed by comparing and contrasting
   attributes of ABFT and canal irrigation storage. These hypotheses may be
   used in future research to evaluate the conditions in which storage
   enhances prospects for sustainable governance.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-47},

Abstract = {Overcoming environmental challenges requires understanding when and why
   individuals adopt cooperative behaviors, how individual behaviors and
   interactions among resource users change over time, and how group
   structure and group dynamics impact behaviors, institutions, and
   resource conditions. Cultural multilevel selection (CMLS) is a
   theoretical framework derived from theories of cultural evolution and
   cultural group selection that emphasizes pressures affecting different
   levels of social organization as well as conflicts among these levels.
   As such, CMLS can be useful for understanding many environmental
   challenges. With this paper, we use evidence from the literature and
   hypothetical scenarios to show how the framework can be used to
   understand the emergence and persistence of sustainable
   social-ecological systems. We apply the framework to the Balinese system
   of rice production and focus on two important cultural traits
   (synchronized cropping and the institutions and rituals associated with
   water management). We use data from the literature that discusses
   bottom-up (self-organized, complex adaptive system) and top-down
   explanations for the system and discuss how (1) the emergence of group
   structure, (2) group-level variation in cropping strategies,
   institutions, and rituals, and (3) variation in overall yields as a
   result of different strategies and institutions, could have allowed for
   the spread of group-beneficial traits and the increasing complexity of
   the system. We also outline cultural transmission mechanisms that can
   explain the spread of group-beneficial traits in Bali and describe the
   kinds of data that would be required to validate the framework in
   forward-looking studies.},

Title = {Social-ecological assessment of Lake Manyara basin, Tanzania: A mixed
   method approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {267},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {The social-ecological system of the Lake Manyara basin (Northern
   Tanzania), a UNESCO Biosphere reserve (BR) suffers from social-economic
   and environmental problems due to decreasing water levels, erosion and
   land and water use conflicts. We propose an integrated assessment of the
   social-ecological interactions of the area to support future sustainable
   management. Within the Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR)
   framework an integrated literature review and several methods of
   knowledge collection were combined to identify future management
   priorities and challenges. During focus groups with farmers and
   pastoralists, stakeholders confirmed the role played by land use changes
   as driver and pressure in the landscape, e.g. through increased erosion
   rates and siltation of the lake. Moreover, economic and social issues
   were identified as prominent factors being influenced by, or influencing
   these processes. These statements match the scientific literature.
   During participatory mapping exercises different spatial and resource
   allocation perceptions appeared amongst pastoralists and farmers. The
   multidisciplinary approach proved to be useful to acquire an integrated
   and comprehensive understanding of the state, challenges and
   opportunities of Lake Manyara BR, to feed into a decision support system
   in service of an integrated management plan. Our assessment suggests
   that improved water governance in a multi-actor approach (with a focus
   on distribution of benefits, rights, and a specific role of the water
   authorities) should be a priority for future integrated management
   strategies. Also, awareness raising amongst decision makers, scientists
   and local communities is needed to demonstrate the advantages of an
   integrated approach. And finally, visible and fair mechanisms to share
   conservation revenues should be designed in a way that local benefits
   can be obtained together with incentive mechanisms for co-management and
   conservation.},

Abstract = {Socio-ecological systems (SESs), the spate irrigation system in our
   case, operate under the environment of stress from several external and
   contextual factors. The literature on collective action in Common Pool
   Resources (CPRs) considers non-storage and non-stationary
   characteristics of a resource as major obstacle to its sustainability.
   However, the case study systems have endured, despite acute scarcity and
   uncertainty of irrigation, for centuries in arid and semi-arid
   environments of the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, parts of South
   America and Central Asia, where rainfall is too low to support rainfed
   farming. These rainfall dependent irrigation systems are more complex
   and can exhibit unexpected changes as a result of climatic disturbances.
   Thus, actions directed at enhancing robustness to a particular set of
   disturbances can trigger changes in ecological dynamics that may, in
   turn, alter the set of disturbances faced by communities. The four case
   study systems for this research were selected from the Punjab (Pakistan)
   by purposive sampling, comprising two perennial and non-perennial farmer
   managed spate irrigation systems (FMIS) and two perennial and
   non-perennial agency managed irrigation systems (AMIS), providing 2X2
   typology for analysis. The sustainability framework by Anderies et al.
   (A framework to analyse the robustness of social-ecological systems from
   an institutional perspective. Ecology and Society, 2004) has been used
   for analysis of this study.},

Abstract = {A new generation of agricultural research programs are embracing use of
   participation as a vehicle for achieving greater impact and supporting
   transformative change in complex social-ecological systems. In this
   paper, we share learning from use of participatory action research in
   the Tonle Sap biosphere in Cambodia, as the main implementing
   methodology within a large multi-partner agricultural research program.
   We describe the program's espoused approach to applying participatory
   methodologies focusing on co-ownership, equity and reflexivity with

Title = {Perspectives on Climate Change, Mountain Hydrology, and Water Resources
   in the Oregon Cascades, USA},
Journal = {MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {S35-S46},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {From both social and environmental perspectives, water is the main
   connection between highland and lowland processes in mountain
   watersheds: Water flows downhill while human impacts flow uphill. For
   example, in the Oregon Cascades mountain range, geology, vegetation, and
   climate influence the hydrologic connections within watersheds. Geology
   determines which watersheds are surface runoff-dominated and which are
   groundwater-dominated. In this Mediterranean climate with dry summers,
   surface runoff watersheds will consistently experience near-zero late
   summer discharge, so declining snowpacks will have little effect on low
   flows. This contrasts with groundwater-dominated watersheds, where a
   shift from snow to rain or a decline in precipitation will reduce
   recharge, thereby reducing late summer groundwater contributions to
   streamflow. Earlier snowmelt causes forests to transpire earlier,
   resulting in decreased springtime streamflow. Reduced snowpacks lead to
   soil moisture stress, making forests more vulnerable to extensive
   wildfires and affecting the lifespan and composition of forests.
   Monitoring and quantifying these complex linkages and feedbacks require
   appropriate measurement networks. Sampling strategies often use
   watershed typology to identify where measurements should be focused.
   Such an approach should include not only established watershed
   classification parameters such as topology and geology but also
   interannual climate variability and land cover. As concerns of water
   scarcity and vulnerability move to the forefront, our watershed
   classifications should be extended to include ecosystem and
   social-ecological parameters. An integrated and agent-based modeling
   scheme called Envision has been developed to simulate alternative future
   landscapes at the watershed scale. Using fully coupled models of
   hydrology, ecosystems, and socioeconomics, decision-makers can simulate
   the effects of policy decisions in conjunction with other climate
   forcing, land use change, and economic disturbances. To understand the
   combined impacts of climate change and humans on water in mountain
   watersheds, researchers must develop integrated monitoring and modeling
   systems that explicitly include connections across eco-hydrologic and
   social-ecological systems.},

Abstract = {This study aims at exploring ways of increasing adaptive capacity and
   reducing vulnerability of farmers in the face of water scarcity through
   establishing a link between social network indicators and the dimensions
   of adaptive capacity. For this purpose, a Social Network Analysis (SNA)
   model along with a Structural Equation Model was developed to
   investigate the effects of SNA indices on the dimensions influencing the
   adaptive capacity of the water users in rural areas in the west of Iran.
   The developed model links participation in production and knowledge
   exchange with ten critical dimensions identified to affect the adaptive
   capacities of water resources users. The results indicated that the most
   important subdimensions affecting adaptive capacity were governance,
   innovation, and awareness. Also, the positive effects of individual and
   whole network level of indices on the adaptive capacity indicated high
   coherence in the study area and the ability of people to develop social
   learning to improve the adaptive capacity.},

Abstract = {Pressures on urban, peri-urban and rural water and agricultural systems
   are increasingly complex with multiple interacting stresses and impacts.
   As a way of addressing these issues there has been increasing
   consideration as to how to build and manage resilience in these complex
   social-ecological systems. This paper presents a case study of the role
   of water recycling for agricultural use within the context of the
   peri-urban water cycle in Western Sydney, Australia. Building upon a
   description of the water cycle associated with water reclaimed from
   urban wastewater and stormwater harvesting; aspects which enhance
   resilience are identified and discussed. These include water resource
   security, avoidance of wastewater discharges to receiving waters,
   enhanced processes of landscape ecology, provision of ecosystem
   services, environmental risk management, local agricultural products and
   services, social values, livelihood opportunity, and the industrial

Title = {Sustainability Assessment of Water Resources in Beijing},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {A sustainability assessment of water resources is essential for
   maintaining regional sustainable development. In this study, a
   comprehensive assessment of changes in the sustainability of the water
   resource system in Beijing from 2008 to 2018 was conducted on the basis
   of the driver-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) model. To reflect
   the impacts of humans on the water consumption and pollution of water
   resources, the water footprint was considered. In addition, key factors
   that affect the sustainability of water resources were filtered by the
   modified entropy method. The results indicated that all drivers,
   pressures, states, impacts, and responses demonstrated increasing
   tendencies. As a result, a remarkable improvement in the sustainability
   of the water system, which was mitigated from an alert state to a good
   state, was achieved due to the comprehensive effect of the indexes. From
   these results, we inferred that the sustainability of regional water
   resources could only be achieved through a comprehensive consideration
   of regional social, economic, and environmental water systems and
   climate change. Therefore, formulating medium- and long-term urban,
   economic, and water development plans and adjusting medium- and
   short-term water utilization programs could contribute to the
   sustainable utilization of regional water resources.},

Title = {Connecting Social Networks with Ecosystem Services for Watershed
   Governance: a Social-Ecological Network Perspective Highlights the
   Critical Role of Bridging Organizations},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {In many densely settled agricultural watersheds, water quality is a
   point of conflict between amenity and agricultural activities because of
   the varied demands and impacts on shared water resources. Successful
   governance of these watersheds requires coordination among different
   activities. Recent research has highlighted the role that social
   networks between management entities can play to facilitate cross-scale
   interaction in watershed governance. For example, bridging organizations
   can be positioned in social networks to bridge local initiatives done by
   single municipalities across whole watersheds. To better understand the
   role of social networks in social-ecological system dynamics, we combine
   a social network analysis of the water quality management networks held
   by local governments with a social-ecological analysis of variation in
   water management and ecosystem services across the Monteregie, an
   agricultural landscape near Montreal, Quebec, Canada. We analyze
   municipal water management networks by using one-mode networks to
   represent direct collaboration between municipalities, and two-mode
   networks to capture how bridging organizations indirectly connect
   municipalities. We find that municipalities do not collaborate directly
   with one another but instead are connected via bridging organizations
   that span the water quality management network. We also discovered that
   more connected municipalities engaged in more water management
   activities. However, bridging organizations preferentially connected
   with municipalities that used more tourism related ecosystem services
   rather than those that used more agricultural ecosystem services. Many
   agricultural municipalities were relatively isolated, despite being the
   main producers of water quality problems. In combination, these findings
   suggest that further strengthening the water management network in the
   Monteregie will contribute to improving water quality in the region.
   However, such strengthening requires developing a network that better
   connects both agricultural and tourism oriented municipalities.
   Furthermore, these findings show that consideration of the
   social-ecological context of social networks, can help explain the
   structure of networks and reveal social-ecological clusters and
   disconnects in a network.},

Title = {Mechanisms of resilience in common-pool resource management systems:: an
   agent-based model of water use in a river basin},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The concept of resilience is widely promoted as a promising notion to
   guide new approaches to ecosystem and resource management that try to
   enhance a system's capacity to cope with change. A variety of mechanisms
   of resilience specific for different systems have been proposed. In the
   context of resource management those include but are not limited to the
   diversity of response options and flexibility of the social system to
   adaptively respond to changes on an adequate scale. However,
   implementation of resilience-based management in specific real-world
   systems has often proven difficult because of a limited understanding of
   suitable interventions and their impact on the resilience of the coupled
   social-ecological system. We propose an agent-based modeling approach to
   explore system characteristics and mechanisms of resilience in a complex
   resource management system, based on a case study of water use in the
   Amudarya River, which is a semiarid river basin. Water resources in its
   delta are used to sustain irrigated agriculture as well as aquatic
   ecosystems that provide fish and other ecosystem services. The three
   subsystems of the social-ecological system, i.e., the social system, the
   irrigation system, and an aquatic ecosystem, are linked by resource
   flows and the allocation decision making of actors on different levels.
   Simulation experiments are carried out to compare the resilience of
   different institutional settings of water management to changes in the
   variability and uncertainty of water availability. The aim is to
   investigate the influence of ( 1) the organizational structure of water
   management, ( 2) information on water availability, and ( 3) the
   diversity of water uses on the resilience of the system to short and
   long-term water scarcity. In this paper, the model concept and first
   simulation results are presented. As a first illustration of the
   approach the performances of a centralized and a decentralized regime
   are compared under different scenarios of information on water
   availability. Under the given conditions of a regularly fluctuating
   inflow and compliance of agents with orders from a national authority,
   the centralized system performs better as long as irrigation is the only
   type of water use. Diversification of resource use, e. g., irrigation
   and fishing, increases the performance of the decentralized regime and
   the resilience of both. Systematic analysis of the performance of
   different system structures will help to identify properties and
   mechanisms of resilience. This understanding will be valuable for the
   identification, development, and evaluation of management interventions
   in specific river basins.},

Title = {Groundwater Connections and Sustainability in Social-Ecological Systems},

Abstract = {Groundwater resources are connected with social, economic, ecological,
   and Earth systems. We introduce the framing of groundwater-connected
   systems to better represent the nature and complexity of these
   connections in data collection, scientific investigations, governance
   and management approaches, and groundwater education.
   Groundwater-connected systems are social, economic, ecological, and
   Earth systems that interact with groundwater, such as irrigated
   agriculture, groundwater-dependent ecosystems, and cultural
   relationships to groundwater expressions such as springs and rivers.
   Groundwater-connected systems form social-ecological systems with
   complex behaviors such as feedbacks, nonlinear processes, multiple
   stable system states, and path dependency. These complex behaviors are
   only visible through this integrated system framing and are not
   endogenous properties of physical groundwater systems. The framing is
   syncretic as it aims to provide a common conceptual foundation for the
   growing disciplines of socio-hydrogeology, eco-hydrogeology, groundwater
   governance, and hydro-social groundwater analysis. The framing also
   facilitates greater alignment between the groundwater sustainability
   discourse and emerging sustainability concepts and principles. Aligning
   with these concepts and principles presents groundwater sustainability
   as more than a physical state to be reached; and argues that place-based
   and multifaceted goals, values, justice, knowledge systems, governance,
   and management must continually be integrated to maintain groundwater's
   social, ecological, and Earth system functions. The
   groundwater-connected systems framing can underpin a broad,
   methodologically pluralistic, and community-driven new wave of data
   collection and analysis, research, governance, management, and
   education. These developments, together, can invigorate efforts to
   foster sustainable groundwater futures in the complex systems
   groundwater is embedded within.},

Abstract = {People in the Arctic face uncertainty in their daily lives as they
   contend with environmental changes at a range of scales from local to
   global. Freshwater is a critical resource to people, and although water
   resource indicators have been developed that operate from regional to
   global scales and for midlatitude to equatorial environments, no
   appropriate index exists for assessing the vulnerability of Arctic
   communities to changing water resources at the local scale. The Arctic
   Water Resource Vulnerability Index (AWRVI) is proposed as a tool that
   Arctic communities can use to assess their relative
   vulnerability-resilience to changes in their water resources from a
   variety of biophysical and socioeconomic processes. The AWRVI is based
   on a social-ecological systems perspective that includes physical and
   social indicators of change and is demonstrated in three case study
   communities/watersheds in Alaska. These results highlight the value of
   communities engaging in the process of using the AWRVI and the
   diagnostic capability of examining the suite of constituent physical and
   social scores rather than the total AWRVI score alone.},

Title = {Shifting or drifting? The crisis-driven advancement and failure of
   private smallholder irrigation from sand river aquifers in southern arid
   Zimbabwe},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {241},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {In recent years more recognition is given to the benefits and risks of
   private smallholder irrigation development across sub-Saharan Africa. It
   is acknowledged for its capacity to adapt to local circumstances and
   challenges. This study assesses the heterogeneous character of private
   smallholder irrigation in the challenging environment of southern arid
   Zimbabwe, where family farms operate along sand river aquifers, forming
   a reliable natural storage of shallow groundwater. It investigates the
   drivers, characteristics, obstacles and adaptive capacity of this yet
   undocumented form of private irrigation in a historically marginalised
   area, and in particular also the discontinuation of these informal
   irrigation ventures. The research combines results from analysing
   satellite images, and quantitative and qualitative field work, whereby a
   social-ecological system perspective is applied.
   This form of private smallholder irrigation is distinct from most other
   documented cases in sub-Saharan Africa. First, because of the unique
   interrelation between the water source, technology need and
   fuel-dependency in an economically marginalised area. Second, because
   drivers for the emergence of private smallholder irrigation are not
   market-based but crisis-driven; recurrent droughts and frequent
   dry-spells, failure of collectively-managed irrigation schemes, and
   persistent economic instability. As a result, many families cease
   operations because they reach the limits of their adaptive capacity or
   they migrate. Those who succeed, manage to benefit from the abundance of
   water stored in sand rivers, the mobilisation of knowledge and cash
   through rural networks, and the existence of cross-border trade
   opportunities. However, they hardly ever pass the level of subsistence
   in an area where stable markets are absent. Organising potential support
   to private smallholder irrigation remains a challenging and disputable
   avenue as this might undermine its independent and adaptive nature.},

Abstract = {In a multi-reservoir system, ensuring adequate water availability across
   reservoirs while managing conflicting goals under uncertainties are
   critical to making the social-ecological system sustainable. The
   priorities of multiple user-groups and availability of the water
   resource may vary with time, weather and other factors. Uncertainties
   such as variation in precipitation bring more complexity, which
   intensifies the discrepancies between water supply and water demand for
   each user-group. To reduce such discrepancies, we should satisfice
   conflicting goals, considering typical uncertainties.
   We observed that models are incomplete and inaccurate, which challenge
   the use of the single optimal solution to be robust to uncertainties.
   So, we explore satisficing solutions that are relatively insensitive to
   uncertainties, by incorporating different design preferences,
   identifying sensitive segments and improving the design accordingly.
   This work is an example of exploring the solution space to enhance
   sustainability in multi-disciplinary systems, when goals conflict,
   preferences are evolving, and uncertainties add complexity.},

Abstract = {Managing transboundary river basins requires balancing tradeoffs of
   sustainable water use and coping with climate uncertainty. We
   demonstrate an integrated approach to exploring these issues through the
   lens of a social-ecological system, combining remote and in-situ earth
   observations, hydrologic and climate models, and social surveys.
   Specifically, we examine how climate change and dam development could
   impact the Se Kong, Se San and Sre Pok rivers in the Mekong region. We
   find that climate change will lead to increased precipitation,
   necessitating a shift in dam operations, from maintaining low flows to
   reducing flood hazards. We also find that existing water governance
   systems in Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia are ill-prepared to address the
   problem. We conclude that the solution space for addressing these
   complex issues will be highly constrained unless major deficiencies in
   transboundary water governance, strategic planning, financial capacity,
   information sharing, and law enforcement are remedied in the next
   decades.},

Abstract = {In recent years urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) has gained
   increasing attention, while a comprehensive synthesis and identification
   of research gaps is lacking. The present review indicates that with a
   share of 27\% of scholarly publications sub-Saharan Africa is the
   geographical region most often reported in scientific literature. Middle
   East and North Africa (MENA, 1.9\%) and Oceania (2.8\%) in contrast
   appeared underrepresented. Megacities (> 5 million inhabitants) received
   less scientific attention than smaller agglomerations. 3.6\% of UPA
   publications addressed heavy metals, of which 82\% detected a
   contamination in plants, soil or irrigation water above recommended
   thresholds, but the thereby bioavailability of heavy metals remains
   unclear. Organic pollutants in contrast seem to be understudied. 1.7\%
   of the studies focused on microbial contamination in UPA and 9.7\%
   addressed socio-economic aspects of urban agriculture. The latter are
   very context specific and span from supplementation of food in poor
   households to market-oriented production. Only 2\% of studies explicitly
   dealt with animal husbandry in UPA. This topic should receive more
   scientific attention, since the integration of urban animal husbandry
   with cropping systems has large potential for recycling of nutrients.
   Similarly, only 2.4\% of studies examined urban foodsheds and food
   supply, despite the challenge of ongoing urbanization, which requires
   increasing source areas for feeding cities. Maintaining ecosystems
   services in an urban environment that is highly competitive for scarce
   resources such as space, water, labour and capital requires an efficient
   resource management at different spatial scales. This calls for
   interdisciplinary research approaches in a social-ecological systems
   framework.},

Title = {Irrigation experiments in the lab: trust, environmental variability, and
   collective action},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Research on collective action and common/pool resources is extensive.
   However, little work has concentrated on the effect of variability in
   resource availability and collective action, especially in the context
   of asymmetric access to resources. Earlier works have demonstrated that
   environmental variability often leads to a reduction of collective
   action in the governance of shared resources. Here we assess how
   environmental variability may impact collective action. We performed a
   behavioral experiment involving an irrigation dilemma. In this dilemma
   participants invested first into a public fund that generated water
   resources for the group, which were subsequently appropriated by one
   participant at a time from head end to tail end. The amount of resource
   generated for the given investment level was determined by a payoff
   table and a stochastic event representing environmental variability,
   i.e., rainfall. Results show that that (1) upstream users' behavior is
   by far the most important variable in determining the outcome of
   collective action; (2) environmental variability (i.e. risk level in
   investing in the resource) has little effect on individual investment
   and extraction levels; and (3) the action-reaction feedback is
   fundamental in determining the success or failure of communities.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {54},
Number = {3},
Pages = {750-760},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {1. Recent bark beetle outbreaks in North America and Europe have
   impacted forested landscapes and the provisioning of critical ecosystem
   services. The scale and intensity of many recent outbreaks are widely
   believed to be unprecedented.
   2. The effects of bark beetle outbreaks on ecosystems are often measured
   in terms of area affected, host tree mortality rates, and alterations to
   forest structure and composition.
   3. Impacts to human systems focus on changes in property valuation,
   infrastructure damage from falling trees, landscape aesthetics, and the
   quality and quantity of timber and water resources.
   4. To advance our understanding of bark beetle impacts, we assembled a
   team of ecologists, land managers and social scientists to participate
   in a research prioritization workshop.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We identified 25 key questions by using
   an established methodology to identify priorities for research into the
   impacts of bark beetles. Our efforts emphasize the need to improve
   outbreak monitoring and detection, educate the public on the ecological
   role of bark beetles, and develop integrated metrics that facilitate
   comparison of ecosystem services across sites.},

   Network by Exploring the Solution Space},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {141},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In a multireservoir system, ensuring adequate water availability while
   managing conflicting goals is critical to making the social-ecological
   system sustainable in the presence of considerable uncertainty. The
   priorities of multiple user groups and availability of the water
   resource vary with time, weather, and other factors. Uncertainties such
   as variations in precipitation can intensify the discrepancies between
   water supply and water demand. To reduce such discrepancies, we seek to
   satisfice conflicting goals, considering typical uncertainties. We
   observe that models are incomplete and inaccurate, which calls into
   question using a single point solution and suggests the need for
   solutions, which are robust to uncertainties. So, we explore satisficing
   solutions that are relatively insensitive to uncertainties, by
   incorporating different design preferences, identifying sensitive
   segments, and improving the design accordingly. In this article, we
   present an example of the exploration of the solution space to enhance
   sustainability in multidisciplinary systems, when goals conflict,
   preferences are evolving, and uncertainties add complexity, which can be
   applied in mechanical design. In this paper, we focus on the method
   rather than the results.},

Abstract = {It is instructive to read the article that Katharine Coman published in
   the first issue of the American Economic Review to gain insight into the
   problems of collective action related to irrigation in the American
   West. One gains further understanding of the problems Coman identifies
   by using a social-ecological system (Ostrom 2007, 2009) to organize the
   diverse variables identified by Coman. One gains a general lesson from
   this analysis that changing the formal governance structure of
   irrigation is not sufficient to ensure efficient investment in
   facilities or that farmers are able to acquire property and make a
   reasonable living. Building knowledge and trust are, however, essential
   for solving collective-action problems. (JEL B31, N51, Q15, Q25)},

   drivers of change within the Volta River Basin, West Africa.
   Precipitation variability, water availability, land use change, drought
   events, and population growth were perceived as most important, while
   biodiversity loss, social conflicts, pest and disease occurrence,
   urbanization, and pollution were viewed as less critical. A majority of
   these drivers were characterized as ``slow{''} acting processes as

Abstract = {Discussions around adapting water management systems to climate change
   often express the need to increase system flexibility. Yet despite the
   frequent use of the term flexibility, very little work has examined what
   exactly it means to have a flexible water management system, what
   features of a system make it more flexible than another system, or when
   the costs to implement flexible options outweigh the benefits gained
   from increased flexibility. To define and operationalize the concept of
   flexibility in the field of water resources management, this article
   reviews and analyzes concepts of flexibility from the fields of
   information technology, manufacturing, management, and adaptive
   social-ecological systems. We identify five characteristics of flexible
   water resources systems, namely: slack, redundancy, connectivity,
   compatibility/coordination, and adjustability. We then operationalize
   the assessment of flexibility for flood management systems by proposing
   original flexibility metrics and discussing their application. We
   conclude with a discussion on the tradeoffs of increasing flexibility.},

Title = {From Mosaic to Systemic Redux: The Conceptual Foundation of Resilience
   and Its Operational Implications for Water Resource Management},
Journal = {SYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Preserving and enhancing the resilience of water supply systems is an
   important goal for managers to help ensure the ongoing availability of a
   resource necessary to both economic activity and basic survival. If not
   explicitly identified as a goal, it can be inferred from the desire to
   preserve water supply against a variety of stressors for current and
   future generations. Pursuing resilience is less than straightforward as
   there are multiple concurrent theoretical paradigms. Furthermore,
   operationalizing even one of these can be challenging. The authors
   survey several dominant paradigms with an eye towards distilling the
   essential, combinative properties of resilience. The contention
   underwriting this approach is that each paradigm yields important
   insights about resilience as a complex, emergent system characteristic.
   This survey lays the foundation for the operationalized approach that is
   the central thrust of the paper. Specifically, the authors develop an
   equation based on these properties and identify water resource metrics
   that correspond to each property. The analysis concludes with a
   preliminary causal loop diagram intended to capture key system variables
   and relationships between them. The authors argue that a systemic,
   conceptually robust approach to resilience is necessary to (1) assess
   current levels, and (2) improve levels of water resource system
   resilience.},

Title = {The optimal allocation and the evaluation of water resources carrying
   capacity in Shendong mining area},
Journal = {RESOURCES POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {77},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Coal mining has consumed a large amount of water resources in China, and
   the entire industrial chain of coal production has a larger consumption
   of water resources than the past especially in Shendong mining area. The
   water resources carrying capacity determines the scale of coal industry
   development. The previous research had been conducted at the national,
   provincial and municipal levels, but there were few studies on the water
   resources carrying capacity of coal mining areas. The Shendong mining
   area is located in the coal-rich and waterscarce western region, where
   precipitation is low and evaporation is high. As a water-scarce area,
   the development of Shendong mining area is inseparable from the support
   of coal resources and the rational use of water resources. Therefore,
   firstly, taking the Shendong mining area as the research object, this
   paper set high, medium and low scenarios according to the development
   goals of Shendong mining area, Shenhua Group and the plans of China. The
   gray forecast model was used to predict the water demand of the
   economic-social-ecological system of the mining area from 2020 to 2030
   under different scenarios. Secondly, a multi-objective optimization
   model was established with the objective function to optimize the water
   resources allocation in Shendong mining area. Thirdly, based on the
   forecast and optimization results, a water resources carrying capacity
   evaluation model was constructed to evaluate the water resources
   carrying capacity of the Shendong mining area. Finally, based on the
   results, the suggestions for rational development and the utilization of
   water resources in the Shendong mining area were proposed.},

Abstract = {Governing common pool resources (CPR) in the face of disturbances such
   as globalization and climate change is challenging. The outcome of any
   CPR governance regime is the influenced by local combinations of social,
   institutional, and biophysical factors, as well as cross-scale
   interdependencies. In this study, we take a step towards understanding
   multiple-causation of CPR outcomes by analyzing (1) the co-occurrence of
   design principles (DPs) by activity (irrigation, fishery and forestry),
   and (2) the combination(s) of DPs leading to social and ecological
   success. We analyzed 69 cases pertaining to three different activities:
   irrigation, fishery, and forestry. We find that the importance of the
   design principles is dependent upon the natural and hard human made
   infrastructure (i.e. canals, equipment, vessels etc.). For example,
   clearly defined social boundaries are important when the natural
   infrastructure is highly mobile (i.e. tuna fish), while monitoring is
   more important when the natural infrastructure is more static (i.e.
   forests or water contained within an irrigation system). However, we
   also find that congruence between local conditions and rules and
   proportionality between investment and extraction are key for CPR
   success independent from the natural and human hard made infrastructure.
   We further provide new visualization techniques for co-occurrence
   patterns and add to qualitative comparative analysis by introducing a
   reliability metric to deal with a large meta-analysis dataset on
   secondary data where information is missing or uncertain.},

Abstract = {This article examines the environmental and socioeconomic consequences
   of hydraulic infrastructural changes along the Senegal River valley and
   estuary. During the 1980s, two dams were built along the valley floor to
   facilitate hydroelectrical production and regular water supply for crop
   irrigation. In 2003, a breach was dug across Barbary Spit to alleviate
   flooding in the nearby Saint-Louis city. Although these structures
   helped regulate the river flow, they also resulted in a series of
   unforeseen impacts. The study examines these, after on-site measurements
   (topometry, water salinity, piezometry), analysis of hydrological data,
   field observations, and surveys with dam managers, state regional
   directions, and local stakeholders. It stresses the urgency of
   elaborating models of hydraulic management to limit the negative
   consequences of the hydraulic constructions. These models should
   consider the variety of water uses in the middle valley and delta, and
   also the water safety and quality (salinity) downriver from Diama Dam.},

Abstract = {Transformative research in freshwater ecosystems requires successfully
   engaging an array of stakeholders. Local community members are experts
   of the social and ecological systems in which they are embedded and can
   improve scientific research in many ways. We outline several steps for
   researchers to engage local experts specifically by focusing on making
   their projects meaningful to participants. Based on the authors'
   collective experiences of engaging communities in freshwater research,
   we offer 3 sets of practical strategies for facilitating public
   engagement in natural resources research. We outline 3 techniques for
   building mutuality with the local community and local experts, 2
   strategies for building and maintaining relationships, and 5 key efforts
   that help research teams achieve reliable attendance at meetings.
   Involving locals is not merely a means for arranging access to valuable
   research sites or for gathering data. Local experts can inform
   scientific investigations of the ways local social and ecological
   systems interact, improve the communication of science, and enrich the
   experience of field research.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {332},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {The land is a vital resource to support economic growth. Previous
   studies have mainly taken urban and agri-cultural areas as the major
   factors of economic boost. However, the supporting role of diversified
   land in sus-tainable economy has not been fully valued. This study
   analyzed the relationship between land cover diversity and socioeconomic
   outputs from 1992 to 2019 on up to 2086 counties in China. The results
   showed the regional disparity in the eastern and western counties. In
   the western counties, land cover diversity was positively correlated
   with per area socioeconomic indicators throughout the period. In the
   eastern counties, the correlation with per area indicators has gradually
   changed from negative to positive. The correlation with per capita
   in-dicators was more significant in the east than west. The regional
   disparity and temporal trends may come from the influence of water
   resources, demographic pressure and other constraints in different
   regions. The refreshed land value can help to achieve sustainable
   development and improve human well-being in the long term.},

Abstract = {Understanding complexity suggests that some problems are more complex
   than others and defy conventional solutions. These wicked problems will
   not be solved by the same tools and processes that are complicit in
   creating them. Neither will they be resolved by approaches short on
   explicating the complex interconnections of the multiple causes,
   consequences, and cross-scale actors of the problem. Climate change is
   one such wicked problem confronting water management in Ghana with a
   dilemma. The physical consequences of climate change on Ghana's water
   resources are progressively worsening. At the same time, existing
   institutional arrangements demonstrate weak capacities to tackle climate
   change-related complexities in water management. Therefore, it warrants
   a dynamic approach imbued with complex and adaptive systems thinking,
   which also capitalizes on instrumental gains from prior existing
   institutions. Adaptive Co-Management offers such an opportunity for
   Ghana to adapt its water management system to climate change.},

Title = {Assessing the implications of water harvesting intensification on
   upstream-downstream ecosystem services: A case study in the Lake Tana
   basin},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {542},

Abstract = {Water harvesting systems have improved productivity in various regions
   in sub-Saharan Africa. Similarly, they can help retain water in
   landscapes, build resilience against droughts and dry spells, and
   thereby contribute to sustainable agricultural intensification. However,
   there is no strong empirical evidence that shows the effects of
   intensification of water harvesting on upstream-downstream
   social-ecological systems at a landscape scale. In this paper we develop
   a decision support system (DSS) for locating and sizing water harvesting
   ponds in a hydrological model, which enables assessments of water
   harvesting intensification on upstream-downstream ecosystem services in
   meso-scale watersheds. The DSS was used with the Soil and Water
   Assessment Tool (SWAT) for a case-study area located in the Lake Tana
   basin, Ethiopia. We found that supplementary irrigation in combination
   with nutrient application increased simulated teff (Eragrostis tef,
   staple crop in Ethiopia) production up to three times, compared to the
   current practice. Moreover, after supplemental irrigation of teff, the
   excess water was used for dry season onion production of 7.66 t/ha
   (median). Water harvesting, therefore, can play an important role in
   increasing local-to regional-scale food security through increased and
   more stable food production and generation of extra income from the sale
   of cash crops. The annual total irrigation water consumption was similar
   to 4\%-30\% of the annual water yield from the entire watershed. In
   general, water harvesting resulted in a reduction in peak flows and an
   increase in low flows. Water harvesting substantially reduced sediment
   yield leaving the watershed. The beneficiaries of water harvesting ponds
   may benefit from increases in agricultural production. The downstream
   social-ecological systems may benefit from reduced food prices, reduced
   flooding damages, and reduced sediment influxes, as well as enhancements
   in low flows and water quality. The benefits of water harvesting warrant
   economic feasibility studies and detailed analyses of its ecological
   impacts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In arid environments, water is a highly unpredictable natural resource.
   Land use must be adapted to the availability of water for plant growth
   and as drinking water. In the oases along the river Draa, the
   variability of available water is partly buffered by natural storage and
   by human management. The vast areas outside the oases are used as
   rangelands. Here, water resources can only be managed indirectly,
   through the management of the vegetation and natural resources, firewood
   and forage. To understand the effects of direct and indirect water
   resource management on the social-ecological system's functioning, local
   land use strategies must be analyzed. In the past, research has
   concentrated on the management of water resource scarcity because this
   is an obvious problem of natural resource management in arid regions. In
   this section, we apply a broadened approach and analyze the relevant
   factors on an annual and inter-annual scale. We identify key traits of
   pastoral land management in the High Atlas region that mitigate the
   negative effects of extreme weather events (droughts and floods) and
   slow down land degradation. Our results show that local land use
   mitigates drought effects through a preventive natural resource
   management, particularly in times of abundant rainfall; it maintains or
   increases the capacity of the rangeland vegetation to buffer against
   rainfall variability.},

Journal = {HYDROLOGY},

Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Common pool resource (CPR) management has the potential to overcome the
   collective action dilemma, defined as the tendency for individual users
   to exploit natural resources and contribute to a tragedy of the commons.
   Design principles associated with effective CPR management help to
   ensure that arrangements work to the mutual benefit of water users. This
   study contributes to current research on CPR management by examining the
   process of implementing integrated management planning through the lens
   of CPR design principles. Integrated management plans facilitate the
   management of a complex common pool resource, ground and surface water
   resources having a hydrological connection. Water governance structures
   were evaluated through the use of participatory methods and observed
   records of interannual changes in rainfall, evapotranspiration, and
   ground water levels across the Northern High Plains. The findings,
   documented in statutes, field interviews and observed hydrologic
   variables, point to the potential for addressing large-scale collective
   action dilemmas, while building on the strengths of local control and
   participation. The feasibility of a ``bottom up{''} system to foster
   groundwater resilience was evidenced by reductions in groundwater depths
   of 2 m in less than a decade.},

   Divide?},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The socio-hydrology community has been very successful in promoting the
   need for taking the human factor into account in the mainstream
   hydrology literature since 2012. However, the interest in studying and
   modeling human-water systems is not new and pre-existed the post-2012
   socio-hydrology. So, it is critical to ask what socio-hydrology has been
   able to offer that would have been unachievable using the existing
   methods, tools, and analysis frameworks. Thus far, the socio-hydrology
   studies show a strong overlap with what has already been in the
   literature, especially in the water resources systems and coupled human
   and natural systems (CHANS) areas. Nevertheless, the work in these areas
   has been generally dismissed by the socio-hydrology literature. This
   paper overviews some of the general concerns about originality,
   practicality, and contributions of socio-hydrology. It is argued that
   while in theory, a common sense about the need for considering humans as
   an integral component of water resources systems models can strengthen
   our coupled human-water systems research, the current approaches and
   trends in socio-hydrology can make this interest area less inclusive and
   interdisciplinary.},

Title = {Can the Indonesian Collective Action Norm of Gotong-Royong Be
   Strengthened with Economic Incentives? Comparing the Implementation of
   an Aquaculture Irrigation Policy Program},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {462-480},
Abstract = {The Indonesian multi-level governmental program (PITAP) is a
   participatory pond irrigation management policy established by the
   Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries. It aims to catalyze the
   rehabilitation of irrigation canals to improve water access for
   small-scale aquaculture farmers. In PITAP, traditional aquaculture
   farmers are incentivized with government funding to create
   community-based co-management groups (POKLINA), to maintain the
   self-governance of their irrigation canals. The logic of PITAP is to
   encourage POKLINA farmers to rehabilitate their irrigation canals
   through subsidized labor payments that are coupled with strengthening
   the strong cultural norm of mutual assistance (i.e., collective action)
   within Indonesian society called Gotong-Royong. PITAP aims to revitalize
   Gotong-Royong through subsidized labor compensation with the hope that
   when the subsidy program is over, Gotong-Royong will be revitalized
   without external support. In this study, we compare and analyze four
   villages on Lombok, Indonesia, that participated in PITAP program in
   2020 and 2021. The study is supported with empirical data using various
   qualitative data collection methods, including interviews, participant
   observations, and the collection of policy documents. We further use the
   Social-Ecological System Framework (SESF) as a diagnostic tool to
   structure the data collection process and analysis. Findings indicate
   that different variables hinder and enable collective action in the four
   villages, leading to different PITAP program outcomes. The likely reason
   for this, suggested by our findings, is that each village has different
   social and ecological conditions that influence intrinsic motivation for
   collective action. PITAP program either crowds out intrinsic motivation
   under some conditions or crowds it in under others. This suggests the
   need to consider contextual adaptations in policy design and
   implementation to improve outcomes better.},

Abstract = {Traditional economic and policy analysis theory has emphasized the
   implementation of private or public property rights regimes in order to

   this approach by examining the strengths and weakness of common property

   by analyzing the acequia irrigation communities in northern New Mexico.
   Through statistical analysis, we find that the acequias' ability to
   maintain collective-action as estimated by a critical performance
   function, crop production, is aided by water sharing agreements and
   access to groundwater, and that it is hampered by property rights
   fragmentation and urbanization. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {The influence of many factors on ecological success in common pool

   with a new methodological approach, artificial neural networks, which is
   discussed in detail. It allows us to develop a model with comparably
   high predictive power. In addition, two success factors are analyzed:
   legal security and institutional fairness. Both factors show a positive
   impact on success in irrigation and fisheries supporting the view that
   there are sector-independent success factors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Year = {2023},
Volume = {63},

Pages = {85-100},
Abstract = {The article addresses the governance of water commons with an emphasis
   on drinking water. The study applied two conceptual frameworks: Ostrom's
   Design Principles and the Social-Ecological Systems framework. The
   empirical part refers to two water commons in Slovenia and is based on
   qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with locals and
   professionals. The article follows three objectives: 1) to identify the
   drivers and motivations for successful local water governance; 2) to
   assess the robustness of water commons in terms of current and future
   challenges; 3) to identify the benefits of water commons. The key
   elements for the functioning of the two local communities under
   examination are shared interests, as well as a strong commitment to
   effective management. In addition to the material benefits (i.e.
   drinking water supply), non-material ones are also important. Community
   building and identity are particularly noteworthy. The importance of
   small drinking water supply systems that are well organised and
   responsibly governed as commons is beneficial not only to a municipality
   but also to a country.},

Title = {Spatial Fit, from Panacea to Practice: Implementing the EU Water
   Framework Directive},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Within the broad discourse on the concept of fit and its relevance for
   the governance of social-ecological systems, problems of spatial fit
   have attracted particular attention. Mismatches abound between the
   geographical extent of an environmental resource and the territorial
   scope of the institutions affecting its use. Managing water resources
   around river basins is, perhaps, the most prominent illustration of
   attempts to reconcile the boundaries of an environmental resource with
   those of its respective institutions. Achieving perfect spatial fit has,
   however, proved an elusive task in practice. Beyond the difficulties of
   defining the physical boundaries of water and reordering institutional
   arrangements to reflect these, improving spatial fit for water can
   create new spatial misfits with other policy sectors upon which
   sustainable water management is dependent. The paper explores the way
   spatial fit is conceptualized, institutionalized, and practised, using
   the EU Water Framework Directive and its implementation in one sub-basin
   of the Rhine as an exemplar. The paper develops from the analysis a more
   differentiated and context-sensitive understanding of the concept of
   spatial fit of practical value to policy makers.},

Title = {A Socio-Ecological System Analysis of Multilevel Water Governance in
   Nicaragua},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Nicaragua enacted its Water Law in 2007, with the Dublin Principles for
   sustainable water management and integrated water resources management
   as its guiding framework. Implementation of the law remains a challenge,
   but significant efforts have been made to roll out this new water
   resources framework, to improve water management by enhancing a
   multilevel water governance system. To analyze multilevel water
   governance in Nicaragua and diagnose stakeholders' roles and compliance
   with the law, we applied a socio-ecological system framework and several
   methods of analysis to process data collected from 52 in-depth
   semistructured interviews conducted with key stakeholders in the water
   sector. We found that the major variables affecting multilevel water
   governance were social interests, administrative capacity, and
   political, economic, and legal arrangements. The results suggest that
   there is centralization at the national level, a tendency toward
   noncollective choice rules, little investment in water resources, and a
   lack of knowledge concerning conflict resolution mechanisms. For
   multilevel water governance, a lack of funds is the main social,
   economic, and political constraint, affecting interactions and outcomes.
   Nevertheless, there is great potential to improve water resource
   management in Nicaragua by enacting the self-funding schemes established
   in the law. Moreover, government institutions, users, and various
   networks are willing to participate and take action to implement the
   law.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {61},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Three decades of economy growth and urbanization has brought China into
   the rim of water crisis. Transition to sustainability has gained
   consensus and put into practice at all administrative levels. However,
   due to locking mechanisms such as sunken investments, vested interests,
   and economic structure, such transition would not prove to be easy. Here
   we adopt the Multi-Level Perspective framework to analyze a county level
   water regime shift in Yiwu of Zhejiang province, which is representative
   for its economic success and severity of water problem in China. The
   transition is described as the interactions between water regime
   subsystems including society, economy, administration, infrastructure,
   and natural water cycling process, as well as the influence from the
   landscape level such as politics. Figures show that the water system is
   making a turnaround to the better side, while the government plays a key
   role in pushing and managing the transition. This study allows us to
   have a glimpse of the whole water regime transition currently happening
   in China, as well as being used for reference in other parts of the
   developing world, for the promoting of sustainable water resource
   management. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Bridging science and traditional knowledge to assess cumulative impacts
   of stressors on ecosystem health},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},

Abstract = {Cumulative environmental impacts driven by anthropogenic stressors lead
   to disproportionate effects on indigenous communities that are reliant
   on land and water resources. Understanding and counteracting these
   effects requires knowledge from multiple sources. Yet the combined use
   of Traditional Knowledge (TK) and Scientific Knowledge (SK) has both
   technical and philosophical hurdles to overcome, and suffers from
   inherently imbalanced power dynamics that can disfavour the very
   communities it intends to benefit. In this article, we present a
   `two-eyed seeing' approach for co-producing and blending knowledge about
   ecosystem health by using an adapted Bayesian Belief Network for the
   Slave River and Delta region in Canada's Northwest Territories. We
   highlight how bridging TM and SK with a combination of field data,
   interview transcripts, existing models, and expert judgement can address
   key questions about ecosystem health when considerable uncertainty
   exists. SK indicators (e.g., bird counts, mercury in fish, water depth)
   were graded as moderate, whereas TM indicators (e.g., bird usage, fish
   aesthetics, changes to water flow) were graded as being poor in
   comparison to the past. SK indicators were predominantly spatial (i.e.,
   comparing to other locations) while the TK indicators were predominantly
   temporal (i.e., comparing across time). After being populated by 16
   experts (local harvesters, Elders, governmental representatives, and
   scientists) using both TK and SK, the model output reported low
   probabilities that the social-ecological system is healthy as it used to
   be. We argue that it is novel and important to bridge TM and SK to
   address the challenges of environmental change such as the cumulative
   impacts of multiple stressors on ecosystems and the services they
   provide. This study presents a critical social-ecological tool for
   widening the evidence-base to a more holistic understanding of the
   system dynamics of multiple environmental stressors in ecosystems and
   for developing more effective knowledge-inclusive partnerships between
   indigenous communities, researchers and policy decision-makers. This
   represents new transformational empirical insights into how wider
   knowledge discourses can contribute to more effective adaptive
   co-management governance practices and solutions for the resilience and
   sustainability of ecosystems in Northern Canada and other parts of the
   world with strong indigenous land tenure. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {This study investigates the historical development of the southwest
   coastal region of Bangladesh through the lens of human-delta
   co-evolutionary system. The change process of social and
   hydro-ecological systems is described based on the
   drivers-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework. The multiple
   physical and socio-economic drivers such as climatic change, upstream
   development, geologic process, land use change-affected river flow,
   salinity, water logging and cyclones are creating adverse impacts on
   ecology (e.g. mangrove forest) and society (e.g. population migration).
   Existing management practices such as the Coastal Embankment project
   (CEP) also created adverse impacts on social-ecological system. In
   addition to the geology of this region that plays the major role in the
   delta development process, human interventions such as large coastal
   development projects have intervened the land formation processes. The
   trends and impacts of these changes along the coast unfold the necessity
   of integrated management approach such as Integrated Water Resources
   Management (IWRM) and Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM).
   Comprehensive understanding of social and hydro-ecological system in
   southwest coastal region through DPSIR approach presented in this study
   can provide effective solution for implementing ongoing management
   strategies.},

Title = {Agricultural intensification and risk in water-constrained hard-rock
   regions: a social-ecological systems study of horticulture cultivation
   in western India},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Developing countries frequently find their poverty reduction initiatives
   to be at odds with promotion of sustainable practices. In India too,
   agricultural intensification through horticulture cultivation is an
   important government strategy to raise farm incomes but its mechanisms
   and implications have not been critically analyzed. Our objective is to
   characterize this intensification and explore conditions under which its
   goals may be achieved while ensuring equity in access to ecological
   services and resilience of the social-ecological system (SES). Our focal
   SES is the water-constrained farm system of western India that overlays
   shallow hard-rock aquifers common to the Indian peninsula. We document
   farm decisions and coping strategies of 121 farmers over two consecutive
   years: a drought year and a good rainfall year. We find that farmers are
   driven to high-value horticulture to remain economically viable in the
   face of increasing social-ecological vulnerability due to factors such
   as monsoon variability, high groundwater development, and uncertainty in
   irrigation access. Through systems modeling, we uncover the feedback
   loops that propagate risk. Risk in access to water, in part due to
   monsoon dry spells, starts a cycle of expensive investments often
   requiring large loans to assure access and a simultaneous move to
   horticulture in response to the elevated cost of water. This mitigates
   risk for the farmer in the short run but, in the absence of regulation
   and complete information about the common groundwater pool, leads to
   competitive investments, driving the regime to greater uncertainty
   levels for the entire community. This vicious cycle of investment and
   intensification escalates risk, leading to frequent crop failure, farmer
   indebtedness, and the tragedy of the commons. Government interventions
   further catalyze this. We propose alternate leverage points to enhance
   social comprehension of risk and facilitate collective action so as to
   negotiate room for human needs while remaining within biophysical
   boundaries.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Integrated assessment and its inherent platform, integrated modelling,
   present an opportunity to synthesize diverse knowledge, data, methods
   and perspectives into an overarching framework to address complex
   environmental problems. However to be successful for assessment or
   decision making purposes, all salient dimensions of integrated modelling
   must be addressed with respect to its purpose and context. The key
   dimensions include: issues of concern; management options and governance
   arrangements; stakeholders; natural systems; human systems; spatial
   scales; temporal scales; disciplines; methods, models, tools and data;
   and sources and types of uncertainty. This paper aims to shed light on
   these ten dimensions, and how integration of the dimensions fits in the
   four main phases in the integrated assessment process: scoping, problem
   framing and formulation, assessing options, and communicating findings.
   We provide examples of participatory processes and modelling tools that
   can be used to achieve integration. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The biophysical phenomenon of terrestrial moisture recycling connects
   distant regions via the atmospheric branch of the water cycle. This
   process, whereby the land surface mediates evaporation to the atmosphere
   and the precipitation that falls downwind, is increasingly
   well-understood. However, recent studies highlight a need to consider an
   important and often missing dimension - the social. Here, we explore the
   social dynamics of three case study countries with strong terrestrial
   moisture recycling: Mongolia, Niger, and Bolivia. We first use the
   WAM-2layers moisture tracking scheme and ERA-Interim climate reanalysis,
   to calculate the evaporation sources for each country's precipitation,
   a.k.a. the precipitationshed. Second, we examine the social aspects of
   source and sink regions, using economic, food security, and land-use
   data. Third, we perform a literature review of relevant economic links,
   land-use policies, and land-use change for each country and its
   evaporation sources. The moisture-recycling analysis reveals that
   Mongolia, Niger, and Bolivia recycle 13, 9, and 18\% of their own
   moisture, respectively. Our analysis of social aspects suggests
   considerable heterogeneity in the social characteristics within each
   country relative to the societies in its corresponding evaporation
   sources. We synthesize our case studies and develop a set of three
   system archetypes that capture the core features of the
   moisturerecycling social-ecological systems (MRSESs): isolated,
   regional, and tele-coupled systems. Our key results are as follows: (a)
   geophysical tele-connections of atmospheric moisture are complemented by
   social tele-couplings forming feedback loops, and consequently, complex
   adaptive systems; (b) the heterogeneity of the social dynamics among our
   case studies renders broad generalization difficult and highlights the
   need for nuanced individual analysis; and, (c) there does not appear to
   be a single desirable or undesirable MRSES, with each archetype
   associated with benefits and disadvantages. This exploration of the
   social dimensions of moisture recycling is part of an extension of the
   emerging discipline of socio-hydrology and a suggestion for further
   exploration of new disciplines such as socio-meteorology or
   socio-climatology, within which the Earth system is considered as a
   coevolutionary social-ecological system.},

Title = {Adaptive Governance of Water Resources Shared with Indigenous Peoples:
   The Role of Law},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Adaptive governance is an emergent phenomenon resulting from the
   interaction of locally driven collaborative efforts with a hierarchy of
   governmental regulation and management and is thought to be capable of
   navigating social-ecological change as society responds to the effects
   of climate change. The assertion of Native American water rights on
   highly developed water systems in North America has triggered governance
   innovations that resemble certain aspects of adaptive governance, and
   have emerged to accommodate the need for Indigenous water development
   and restoration of cultural and ecological resources. Similar
   innovations are observed in the assertion of Indigenous voices in
   Australia. This presents an opportunity to analyze the emergence of
   adaptive processes within complex legal systems. We explore the role of
   law in locally driven innovation in this context, concluding that any
   system of governance that requires greater flexibility will only be
   viewed as legitimate, and thus succeed, if attention is given not only
   to adaptive capacity, but also to aspects of good governance. Through
   examples of the assertion of Indigenous rights, we illustrate critical
   links between adaptive capacity in water management, good governance,
   and law.},

Abstract = {Nature-Based Solutions for Integrated Water Resources Management
   (NbS-IWRM) involve natural, or nature-mimicking, processes used to
   improve water availability in quantity and quality sustainably, reduce
   the risks of water-related disasters, enhance adaptation to climate
   change and increase both biodiversity and the social-ecological system's
   resilience. United Nations and the European Commission promote their
   research as a cornerstone in the changeover to the Ecological
   Transition. In the Sierra Nevada range (Spain) and the Andean
   Cordillera, there is a paradigmatic and ancestral example of NbS-IWRM
   known as ``careo channels{''} and ``amunas{''}, respectively. They
   recharge slope aquifers in mountain areas and consist of an extensive
   network of channels that infiltrate the runoff water generated during
   the snow-thawing and rainy season into the upper parts of the slopes.
   The passage of water through the aquifers in the slope is used to
   regulate the water resources of the mountain areas and thus ensure the
   duration of water availability for the downstream local population and
   generate multiple ecosystem services. This form of water management is
   known as Water Sowing and Harvesting (WS\&H). As shown in this work, it
   is a living example of a resilience and climate change adaptation tool
   that can be qualified as a nature-based solution.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},

Pages = {501-517},
Abstract = {Humans live in complicated social-ecological systems within which we
   interact with our surrounding environment. This interaction is of
   concern to various disciplines, which focus on various system elements
   (factors), many of which are mutually interacting. Assessments of
   vulnerability to climate change assist us in realizing the magnitude of
   the impact of various climate change factors, allowing us to determine
   and adopt appropriate adaptation measures. Nevertheless, previous
   impact-driven vulnerability assessments are either disciplinary or
   multidisciplinary and cannot easily account for the interaction between
   different disciplines. This paper proposes an interdisciplinary
   vulnerability assessment method (IVAM) to develop a framework by which
   interdisciplinary vulnerabilities can be understood. In addition, IVAM
   processes can promote the emergence of an interdisciplinary system,
   which could be used to identify the scope of interdisciplinary influence
   of a particular policy, along with the critical elements (factors) and
   government stakeholders of such policies. This research seeks to further
   the policy goals of the national government of Taiwan vis-a-vis climate
   change, covering the joint cooperation of experts from fields including
   environmental disaster management, public health, food security,
   ecology, and water resource management. The specific advantage of IVAM,
   however, is that this universal model is not limited to any of these
   specific disciplines.},

Title = {Investigating criteria for valuation of forage resources by local
   agro-pastoralists in West Africa: using quantitative ethnoecological
   approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},
Month = {OCT 23},
Abstract = {BackgroundThis paper provides an insightful quantitative ethnoecological
   analysis and affirms that agro-pastoralists have a multiplicity of
   criteria for valuating their natural forage resources. Rural households
   in West Africa are not only confronted with water resource scarcity but
   also have to cope with limited forage resources to feed livestock in
   both wet and dry seasons based on local knowledge. Local agro-pastoral
   social-ecological systems (SESs) in the study areas stem from the daily
   utilization of available forage resources by dominant domestic livestock
   (cattle, goats, and sheep) over the years. However, there is very little
   systematic knowledge documentation on forage-related valuation criteria
   in this part of the world. Hence, this study aimed at examining (1)
   forage resources used for different seasons and livestock types, (2)
   explicit forage-related valuation criteria and associated salience, and
   (3) effects of socio-demographic and climatic aridity on local valuation
   criteria.MethodsTo address these aims, a total of 526 individual
   ethnoecological interviews (encompassing Dagbani, Gurunsi, and Mossi
   ethnic groups) were conducted in 16 villages coupled with vegetation
   sampling of 144 plots in Ghana and Burkina Faso. Rigorous model
   selection, generalized linear mixed-effects models, cognitive salience
   indices, and descriptive statistics were applied.ResultsThe results
   revealed that majority (73\%) of the agro-pastoralists regarded
   herbaceous forage plants to be very palatable for livestock consumption
   in the rainy season and for cattle while woody vegetation and
   crop-related forage plants were rather perceived to be more important in
   the dry season and for goats and sheep. The findings also indicated that
   climatic aridity significantly influenced the number of forage-related
   valuation criteria cited by agro-pastoralists for different seasonal and
   livestock types (p<0.001). It was also found out that agro-pastoralists
   did not only judge forage plants based on their availability but also on
   other criteria such as palatability, stimulation of milk production, and
   healthy growth of livestock.ConclusionLocal agro-pastoralists' knowledge
   on natural forage resources and their valuation criteria is geared
   towards sustainable domestic livestock production. This study is thus
   interesting and crucially important for fellow scientists,
   policy-makers, and other stakeholders in the agricultural production
   sector in local farming landscapes within West Africa and beyond.},

   federal irrigation projects subject to ESA Section 7 prohibitions on
   federal agency actions likely to jeopardize listed species or adversely
   modify critical habitat. Scholarship on Section 7 characterizes the
   process as unwaveringly rigid, the legal ``hammer{''} forcing federal
   agencies to consider endangered species' needs when proposing operations
   and management plans for federally funded irrigation. In this paper, we
   identify barriers to an integrated approach to Section 7 implementation
   and characterize a set of strategies for overcoming its rigidity that
   may have broader applicability. We draw on lessons derived from the
   Klamath Basin along the Oregon-California border, where cross-scale
   processes and venues involving interagency collaboration among leaders
   in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries
   Service, and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation supported efforts to replace
   an ecologically and socially fragmented Upper Basin/Lower Basin approach
   to ESA implementation fraught with conflict. The result was the nation's
   first joint biological opinion (BiOp), which effectively
   institutionalized an adaptive, flexible, integrated approach to water
   sharing among competing interests. Keys to success included existing
   collaborative capacity related to shifting stakeholder networks, trust,
   and relationships and a shift in local agency culture facilitated by
   empathic leadership leading to a greater sense of shared responsibility
   for Section 7 compliance. A collaborative hydrologic modeling process
   enhanced participatory capacity, facilitated transformative social and
   technical learning, and cultivated greater understanding of the
   social-ecological system among key stakeholders. The 2013 joint BiOp
   exemplifies both governmental capacity for flexibility and evolution
   within the constraints of formal law and the potential for greater
   integration among federal agencies and between federal agencies and
   stakeholders involved in ESA implementation.},

Title = {Resilience assessment of blue and green water resources for staple crop
   production in China},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {288},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Blue water (irrigation water) and green water (soil moisture), as
   natural bases in crop production, are vulnerable to natural and
   socioeconomic disturbances. However, quantitative resilience assessments
   of blue and green water for crop production are still lacking. Here we
   constructed a social-ecological based general water resilience
   assessment framework that distinguishes blue and green water for crop
   production in four dimensions, including resistance, absorptive
   capacity, adaptive capacity and transformative capacity. The framework
   was applied to quantify the spatiotemporal characteristics of water
   resource resilience for three staple crops (rice, wheat, and maize) at
   provincial level in mainland China over 2000-2017. Results indicate that
   water resilience related to crop production of China as a whole was at
   the lower-middle level over the study period. The green water resilience
   had higher initial performance, while the blue water resilience had a
   faster growth rate (>50\%). The performance of adaptive and
   transformative capacity was 8.9 similar to 153.7\% better than
   resistance and absorptive capacity. There were significant
   heterogeneities in the water resilience score among crops and in time
   and space. Wheat had the highest resilience of green water, while its
   blue water resilience was the lowest among the three crops. The water
   resilience for crop production varied by up to 2.4-fold across
   provinces. Synergies and trade-offs among the four dimensions of water
   resilience were further evaluated. The current study provides an
   effective approach for assessing the state and progress of resilience of
   regional water resources for crop production.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {166},
Pages = {287-292},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Just after its once-a-decade leadership transition, China faces the
   cumulative consequences of the 30-year drive to grow its economy with
   scant attention paid to mounting ecological and social costs. A survey
   of six main stressors in China - ecosystem degradation, food security,
   energy, water, urbanization and climate change - reveals that domestic
   environmental policies are inadequate and need to be reformed. China's
   ecosystems remain subject to widespread degradation and food insecurity
   is increasing. There are growing conflicts over water quality and
   quantity, and energy demand is rising rapidly. Urbanization is set to
   power future growth in China, yet sustainable urban planning cannot
   proceed without fundamental environmental and social policy reforms.
   Climate change is already negatively impacting China and is projected to
   grow in strength. China's new leaders must act soon to recalibrate
   environmental policies across all these sectors. In addition, they must
   address the lack of interdisciplinary problem-framing and gaps between
   central government policy and local level implementation. While many
   sectoral solutions are already in progress, over the next decade and
   beyond, institutional reform across the country's social-ecological
   systems will be key to solving China's environmental problems. (C) 2013

Journal = {ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {130},
Pages = {258-269},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {While a large number of descriptive studies have delineated the
   interlinkages between water, food and energy resources in the last
   decade, there is still need for systematic conceptualization of resource
   nexus interconnections. This paper proposes a theory of relational
   analysis of the nexus based on the analytical concept of nexus networks.
   A taxonomy of nexus interconnections, detailing sequential and
   hierarchical connections, is characterized between and amongst the
   technosphere and biosphere. We illustrate the use of a novel diagnostic
   tool with regard to its ability to integrate macro-, meso- and
   microscale drivers of nexus problems. We apply this framework to
   problems generated by intensive crop production for exportation in an
   arid landscape (driven by external markets) and sustainable management
   of water resources (driven by public policies) in a southern Spanish
   region. We elucidate interconnected causal mechanisms for groundwater
   overexploitation and profile different social-ecological patterns on a
   spatially-explicit basis. The proposed approach is capable of accounting
   for the water-energy-food resource nexus in an integrated and mull-level
   fashion, addressing the tensions generated by both multi-functionality
   and resource entanglement in complex social-ecological systems.},

Title = {Defining Pathways towards African Ecological Futures},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Africa has experienced unprecedented growth across a range of
   development indices for decades. However, this growth is often at the
   expense of Africa's biodiversity and ecosystems, jeopardizing the
   livelihoods of millions of people depending on the goods and services
   provided by nature, with broader consequences for achieving the United
   Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Encouragingly, Africa can still
   take a more sustainable path. Here, we synthesize the key learnings from
   the African Ecological Futures project. We report results from a
   participatory scenario planning process around four collectively-owned
   scenarios and narratives for the evolution of Africa's ecological
   resource base over the next 50 years. These scenarios provided a lens to
   review pressures on the natural environment, through the drivers,
   pressures, state, impacts, and responses (DPSIR) framework. Based on the
   outcomes from each of these steps, we discuss opportunities to reorient
   Africa's development trajectories towards a sustainable path. These
   opportunities fall under the broad categories of ``effective natural
   resource governance{''}, ``strategic planning capabilities{''},
   ``investment safeguards and frameworks{''}, and ``new partnership
   models{''}. Underpinning all these opportunities are ``data, management
   information, and decision support frameworks{''}. This work can help
   inform collaborative action by a broad set of actors with an interest in
   ensuring a sustainable ecological future for Africa.},

Abstract = {There are growing accounts of innovative, often collaborative
   institutional approaches to water management that seem to respond better
   to new challenges in supply and water quality management. While some
   describe these new institutional designs as a ``third way{''}, as
   opposed to traditional state-centered or market-based modes, we find
   that the most salient features of it to characterize even those
   effective state or market designs. The fundamental ingredient, which is
   patterned relationships, is one that arises when social networks are
   built around the formal (state or market) institutions. The necessary
   plane of description is not on the dimension of structure (state,
   market, or otherwise) but in the nature and workings of these relational
   networks. We describe necessary features of these networks. We
   illustrate these points with a case study: the Environmental Water
   Account (EWA), a novel market-based program for negotiating water
   allocations around the San Francisco Bay-Delta (California, U.S.A.). We
   point out how this institution worked precisely because it was not
   merely a market-based program but, rather, built in features of an
   effective social network. In this way, we found a capacity of the EWA to
   adapt to the dynamic nature of water resources and needs, along with the
   uncertainties inherent in a complex social-ecological system.},

Abstract = {The river basin sustainability depends on both the coordinated
   development of socio-ecological systems and resilience to water
   resources. However, the lack of integrating them on spatial and temporal
   scales compromises our capacity to develop precise interventions towards
   sustainable river basins. We developed an approach by integrating water
   security and social -ecological coupling to assess the river basin
   sustainability. We divided it into four categories including highly
   sustainable (secure and coordinated), insecure, uncoordinated, and low
   sustainable (insecure and uncoordinated). The middle reach of Heihe
   River (MHR) was taken as the study area with the sub -basin as the
   spatial analysis unit from 2000 to 2020. The results showed that there
   was heterogeneity and agglomeration in spatial distribution. 23.8 \%,
   38.8 \%, and 11\% of the sub -basins mainly clustered in the north and
   central areas were found in the state of water insecure and SES
   uncoordinated, or both respectively. The unsustainable areas (five sub
   -basins) and lose -lose areas (two sub -basins) should be the priority
   areas for management interventions. Our approach can provide an
   important reference for assessing and improving the river basin
   sustainability.},

Title = {Interdisciplinary Hazards: Methodological Insights from a Multi-Sectoral
   Study of Drought in the UK},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This article discusses systems-based interdisciplinary research that
   seeks to understand interactions between natural and social dimensions
   of hazards. The discussion in this paper is motivated by two objectives.
   First, to present a novel methodology-Systems-Interactions Maps-for an
   integrated systems-based assessment of the linked social and natural
   causes, pathways, and consequences of climate related hazards, such as
   drought in the UK. Second, the article seeks to contribute to discussion
   of an under-explored topic: the actual process of developing and
   applying conceptual frameworks in interdisciplinary research groups,
   here for the purposes of mapping relationships between successive
   historical drought episodes. The findings based on data from the 1976
   and 1995 droughts in the UK show that identified drivers, responses, and
   impacts can differ between natural and social science disciplines; that
   there is a degree of independence of social from natural dimensions of a
   hazard; and that the relative emphasis on social or natural drivers of a
   drought is shaped by the institutional and governance structure of the
   water sector.},

Abstract = {Study region: This study explores the connectivity of upland farmers and
   downstream fishers through interlinkages of water, energy and food
   within the Dampalit sub-watershed of Laguna Lake, Philippines.
   Study focus: The aim of the study is to yield policy relevant results to
   improve the status of the water resources and food products and to
   reduce possible user conflicts. Surveying 176 households mainly in the
   mid-and downstream areas elements and interlinkages of the local
   Water-Energy-Food Nexus (WEF-Nexus) were identified by the five capitals
   of the sustainable livelihood approach through a socio-ecological
   network analysis.
   New hydrological insights for the region: Besides the innovative
   methodology, this research adds to the underserved local perspective in
   the WEF-Nexus research. The survey shows different livelihood profiles
   for the two groups and a lack of direct social links between the min the
   WEF-Nexus context. Also indirect links through consumption of the other
   group's food products could not be identified. However, a large fraction
   of the population share the use of char coal for cooking, the Makiling
   groundwater for drinking and various household purposes and the Central
   Market in Los Banos for their food supply. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Title = {Promoting Health and Well-Being by Managing for Social-Ecological
   Resilience: the Potential of Integrating Ecohealth and Water Resources
   Management Approaches},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {In coupled social-ecological systems, the same driving forces can result
   in combined social and environmental health inequities, hazards, and
   impacts. Policies that decrease social inequities and improve social
   cohesion, however, also have the potential to improve health outcomes
   and to minimize and offset the drivers of ecosystem change. Actions that
   address both biophysical and social environments have the potential to
   create a ``double dividend{''} that improves human health, while also
   promoting sustainable development. One promising approach to managing
   the complex, reciprocal interactions among ecosystems, society, and
   health is the integration of the ecohealth approach (which holds that
   human health and well-being are both dependent on ecosystems and are
   important outcomes of ecosystem management) with watershed-based water
   resources management. Using key management concepts such as resilience,
   such approaches can help reduce vulnerability to natural hazards,
   maintain ecological flows of water and the provision of other ecological
   services, and promote long-term sustainability of coupled human and
   natural systems. Priorities for understanding and realizing health
   benefits of watershed management include (i) addressing poverty and
   reducing inequities, (ii) promoting resilience (for health) in
   watersheds, and (iii) applying watersheds as a context for intersectoral
   management tools and policy integration. Examples of work linking health
   and watershed management demonstrate that not only is appreciation of
   complex systems important, but an effective approach is participatory
   and transdisciplinary and gives attention to equity and historical
   context.},

   Collaboration in Urban Waterways Management},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Urban waterways are an important part of urban ecosystems, and
   well-managed urban waterways can support diverse benefits to communities
   and nature. The literature suggests that collaborative engagement is a
   pathway to unlocking broader benefits. There is, however, an
   intention-implementation gap, limiting the adoption of community
   collaboration in urban waterways governance. This paper reports on two
   case studies based on interviews and analysed with the aim of better
   understanding the factors that cause this dilemma. The case studies are
   in Melbourne, Australia, and are examples of where such community
   participation practices have been attempted. Our analysis includes
   twenty-three semi-structured interviews from these two cases. Data were
   analysed using the Values-Rules-Knowledge framework, a heuristic to help
   decision-makers analyse how social systems shape decision contexts. The
   results from the case study highlight three key factors that hinder
   effective community involvement. Bureaucratic processes act as de facto
   gatekeepers, reinforcing existing power dynamics. Inclusivity is
   difficult to define and achieve, highlighting the limited availability
   of appropriate tools. Finally, implementing participatory practices is
   resource intensive in terms of time, staff skills, and funding, leading
   to inadequate resourcing. Overcoming these challenges requires a
   comprehensive change in bureaucratic procedures, choice of engagement
   methods, and improved resource management.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes conflict and collaboration and their relation to
   normative structures based on a case study of the history and external
   interventions of the Pillaro North Canal Irrigation System in the
   Ecuadorian Highlands. It does so by using Ostrom's framework for
   analyzing the sustainability of socioecological systems together with an
   analysis of the normative structures that define the governance systems
   through which the interactions in irrigation systems are mediated. I
   argue that the external interventions by the state and NGOs imposed a
   new governance system that undermined the existing normative structures
   and related organizations, leading to internal conflicts. The case study
   suggests that a reformulation of irrigation policies and state
   intervention methodologies in user managed supra-community irrigation
   systems in the Andes could lead to higher levels of cooperation.},

   study of Lake Urmia basin},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {294},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The complexities of water issues, in which human factors directly affect
   the qualitative and quantitative indicators of water resources in a
   variable, extensive, and undefined manner, make social interactions
   necessary for the water resources sustainable development. In this
   situation, local government admins (local divisions of the Water
   Institutions and Ministry of Agriculture) (LGA) can play a fundamental
   role in attracting the participation of independent farmers in
   sustainable agriculture and preserving water resources by modifying
   support policies. In this study, an agent-based simulation model of
   social interactions and economic interests of farmers is presented along
   with different scenarios of support policies as well as random
   supervision and training by LGA agents to evaluate its impact on the
   independent decision making of farmers in the form of a complex adaptive
   system. Questionnaires and expert interviews were used to determine the
   data and scenarios. Farmers' adaptation for development technology in
   irrigation management (DTIM), simulated output of WP, field application
   efficiency (FAE), and their adaptation speed are influenced by input
   factors such as assumed cost of sustainable water supply (SWS), mean
   government expenditure (subsidy count), and the level of supervision and
   training by LGA. The results showed that the assumed cost of SWS and
   government supervision and training are the most influential indicators
   of the farmer agent's propensity to DTIM with F-value=4375.59 and
   F-value=1055.10, respectively. The results confirm that appropriate
   policies in strengthening LGA supervision and training and increasing
   farmers' awareness of the importance of long-term water resource
   sustainability can help achieve more adaptability.},

Abstract = {Water resources management is a nontrivial process requiring a holistic
   understanding of the factors driving the dynamics of human-water
   systems. Policy-induced or autonomous behavioral changes in human
   systems may affect water and land management, which may affect water
   systems and feedback to human systems, further impacting water and land
   management. Currently, hydro-economic models lack the ability to
   describe such dynamics either because they do not account for the
   multifactor/multioutput nature of these systems and/or are not designed
   to operate at a river basin scale. This paper presents a flexible and
   replicable methodological framework for integrating a microeconomic
   multifactor/multioutput Positive Multi-Attribute Utility Programming
   (PMAUP) model with an eco-hydrologic model, the Soil and Water
   Assessment Tool (SWAT). The connection between the models occurs in a
   sequential modular approach through a common spatial unit, the
   ``hydrologic-economic representative units{''} (HERUs), derived from the
   boundaries of decision-making entities and hydrologic responsive units.
   The resulting SWAT-PMAUP model aims to provide the means for exploring
   the dynamics between the behavior of socio-economic agents and their
   connection with the water system through water and land management. The
   integrated model is illustrated by simulating the impacts of irrigation
   restriction policies on the Rio Mundo subbasin in south-eastern Spain.
   The results suggest that agents' adaptation strategies in response to
   the irrigation restrictions have broad economic impacts and subsequent
   consequences on surface and groundwater hydrology. We suggest that the
   integrated modeling framework can be a valuable tool to support
   decision-making in water resources management across a wide range of
   scales.},

Title = {Integrated and Adaptive Management of Water Resources: Tensions,
   Legacies, and the Next Best Thing},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Integrated water resources management (IWRM) and adaptive management
   (AM) are two institutional and management paradigms designed to address
   shortcomings within water systems governance; the limits of hierarchical
   water institutional arrangements in the case of IWRM and the challenge
   of making water management decisions under uncertainty in the case of
   AM. Recently, there has been a trend to merge these paradigms to address
   the growing complexity of stressors shaping water management such as
   globalization and climate change. However, because many of these joint
   approaches have received little empirical attention, questions remain
   about how they might work, or not, in practice. Here, we explore a few
   of these issues using empirical research carried out in Brazil. We focus
   on highlighting the potentially negative interactions, tensions, and
   trade-offs between different institutions/mechanisms perceived as
   desirable as research and practice attempt to make water systems
   management simultaneously integrated and adaptive. Our examples pertain
   mainly to the use of techno-scientific knowledge in water management and
   governance in Brazil's IWRM model and how it relates to participation,
   democracy, deliberation, diversity, and adaptability. We show that a
   legacy of technical and hierarchical management has shaped the
   integration of management, and subsequently, the degree to which
   management might also be adaptive. Although integrated systems may be
   more legitimate and accountable than top-down command and control ones,
   the mechanisms of IWRM may be at odds with the flexible, experimental,
   and self-organizing nature of AM.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the effectiveness of three WUAs in the arid and
   semi-arid regions of northwest China, drawing upon empirical evidence
   collected through mixed methodologies. Results show significant
   discrepancies between understanding, motives and experiences regarding
   WUAs among different water stakeholders. These discrepancies are
   affected by a complex interaction of a variety of factors, including
   geographical locations, socio-economic and political contexts, personal
   experiences, knowledge gaps, incentives and value systems rather than
   ordinary socio-demographic variables. It has also shown that in a
   traditionally clientelistic society such as China social networks and
   the pattern of relations between different levels (either cooperative or
   exploitative) can be more important in participatory irrigation
   management than the existence of formal institutions or regulation.
   Furthermore, the roles of social networks on water governance are not
   necessarily positive, including collective exploitation, corruption
   especially rent-seeking and collusion. It concludes that for WUAs to be
   effective, they have to be context specific better understanding and
   strategic uses of social networks with shared water motives and goals
   among different stakeholders.},

Abstract = {Climate variability and change are directly challenging the viability
   and sustainability of social-ecological systems. This is particularly
   true for water resources. Effective water governance is at the heart of
   alleviating water challenges and is thus considered crucial for building
   adaptive capacity to cope with future uncertainty and impacts from
   climate change. Despite advances in the conceptualisation of adaptive
   capacity, there are few empirical examples that look systematically
   across cases to identify how to implement measures and actions that
   build and mobilise adaptive capacity. This paper contributes to the
   understanding of adaptive capacity to climate stress by analysing the
   bridges and barriers to adaptation across water governance and
   management regimes in the case of the Canton Valais, Switzerland and the
   state of Georgia, USA. We find that while there is no single way to
   build and mobilise adaptive capacity across different scales of
   governance, the analysis points to a set of common bridges and barriers
   for building adaptive capacity to a variety of climatic events. Common
   bridges include trust and actor relationships, regional collaboration,
   leadership, and regulatory and legislative aspects. Common barriers
   include political, regulatory and legislative, and perception and
   cognitive aspects.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to identify drivers and barriers to the achievement of
   EU water policy objectives in the agricultural sector by adopting an
   institutional perspective on water quality management at the landscape
   level. We apply a conceptual framework combining Integrated Landscape
   Management (ILM) and Institutional Design Principles (IDP) perspectives
   to analyze cooperation initiatives involving water suppliers and
   agricultural stakeholders to protect drinking water catchments from
   agricultural diffuse pollution. Three cases representing different forms
   of cooperation in rural landscapes in France were investigated on the
   basis of primary data collected at the local, water-basin and national
   levels. The results show that the success of multi-stakeholder
   collective action depends on both local factors such as characteristics
   of the water resource and stakeholders (knowledge, resources, trust and
   social capital) and on factors linked to the EU and national water and
   agricultural policy frameworks. In addition to the identification of
   drivers of and constraints on the implementation of EU water policy in
   agricultural landscapes, the analysis highlights the conceptual added
   value in combining the IDP and ILM approaches to understand policy
   implementation processes at the landscape level.},

Abstract = {Water resources and water-related ecosystem services are vital to
   social-ecological systems, yet in many parts of the world water as a
   finite resource is revealed by its unsustainable and inequitable use.
   Increased threats to water security and supply of ecosystem services
   arise due to increasing and contested demand and declining supply due to
   climate change and other stressors. Trade-off decisions need to be made
   between competing sectors of food production, hydropower generation and
   environmental needs: the water-food-energy-environment nexus. New
   approaches are needed to address how water resources and ecosystem
   service benefits are shared among competing interests. One approach
   involves changes to decision contexts, shaped by the values, rules and
   knowledge which decision makers draw upon when considering options. By
   changing decision contexts, new opportunities become available. Here, we
   describe Nexus Webs; a knowledge framework designed to promote
   collaborative exploration of synergies and trade-offs and enable changes
   in decision contexts for water use. As part of the process of shifting
   this framework from concept to operation, we apply Nexus Webs to
   contrasting water use scenarios in the Pangani Basin (Tanzania and
   Kenya), where water is over-allocated and highly contested. Under each
   scenario, we detail linkages between different water uses and their
   effects on assets (ecosystems, biodiversity and built infrastructure),
   the effects on assets for the supply of ecosystem services and how these
   affect livelihoods and wellbeing. We outline how Nexus Webs can be
   developed and used to change the decision context to consider options
   for more socially inclusive and equitable use of water resources.},

Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},

Volume = {13},

Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Black carbon and dust deposition advanced the end of the snow season by
   17 days on average over the last 40 years in the French Alps and the
   Pyrenees. The warming-induced snow cover decline was partly offset by
   decreases in black carbon deposition observed since the 1980s.
   By darkening the snow surface, mineral dust and black carbon (BC)
   deposition enhances snowmelt and triggers numerous feedbacks.
   Assessments of their long-term impact at the regional scale are still
   largely missing despite the environmental and socio-economic
   implications of snow cover changes. Here we show, using numerical
   simulations, that dust and BC deposition advanced snowmelt by 17 +/- 6
   days on average in the French Alps and the Pyrenees over the 1979-2018
   period. BC and dust also advanced by 10-15 days the peak melt water
   runoff, a substantial effect on the timing of water resources
   availability. We also demonstrate that the decrease in BC deposition
   since the 1980s moderates the impact of current warming on snow cover
   decline. Hence, accounting for changes in light-absorbing particles
   deposition is required to improve the accuracy of snow cover reanalyses
   and climate projections, that are crucial for better understanding the
   past and future evolution of mountain social-ecological systems.},

Title = {Understanding social-ecological vulnerability with Q-methodology: a case

Abstract = {A broad range of participatory methods can be employed to understand the
   vulnerability of social-ecological systems threatened by various drivers
   of change including climate change and land-use change. Understanding
   this vulnerability is critical for managing natural resources,
   particularly water resources that flow across jurisdictional boundaries,
   and support conflicting uses. This paper demonstrates Q-methodology, a
   promising participatory method infrequently applied in the vulnerability
   context, with a case study investigation of the vulnerability of
   stakeholders reliant on water-based ecosystem services derived from the
   Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming, USA. The approach identified four
   distinct viewpoints regarding vulnerability, including an environmental
   perspective, agricultural perspective, Native American perspective, and
   recreation perspective. The distinct viewpoints highlighted disparate
   levels of importance related to 34 water benefits, such as commercial
   irrigation, oil and natural gas extraction, river-based fishing, and
   cultural and spiritual use. A diverse range of drivers of change
   threatening important water benefits were also identified, including
   pollution, too much management intervention, and development of
   recreation opportunities. The potential benefits of Q-methodology for
   vulnerability assessment include a rank-ordering exercise that elicits
   preferences for tradeoffs, and statistical derivation of a small number
   of perspectives about the topic.},

Title = {Sensitivity of emergent sociohydrologic dynamics to internal system
   properties and external sociopolitical factors: Implications for water
   management},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {52},
Number = {6},
Pages = {4944-4966},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {It is increasingly acknowledged that effective management of water
   resources requires a holistic understanding of the coevolving dynamics
   inherent in the coupled human-hydrology system. One of the fundamental
   information gaps concerns the sensitivity of coupled system feedbacks to
   various endogenous system properties and exogenous societal contexts.
   This paper takes a previously calibrated sociohydrology model and
   applies an idealized implementation, in order to: (i) explore the
   sensitivity of emergent dynamics resulting from bidirectional feedbacks
   to assumptions regarding (a) internal system properties that control the
   internal dynamics of the coupled system and (b) the external
   sociopolitical context; and (ii) interpret the results within the
   context of water resource management decision making. The analysis
   investigates feedback behavior in three ways, (a) via a global
   sensitivity analysis on key parameters and assessment of relevant model
   outputs, (b) through a comparative analysis based on hypothetical
   placement of the catchment along various points on the international
   sociopolitical gradient, and (c) by assessing the effects of various
   direct management intervention scenarios. Results indicate the presence
   of optimum windows that might offer the greatest positive impact per
   unit of management effort. Results further advocate management tools
   that encourage an adaptive learning, community-based approach with
   respect to water management, which are found to enhance centralized
   policy measures. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to use a
   place-based sociohydrology model to make abstractions as to the dynamics
   of bidirectional feedback behavior, and provide insights as to the
   efficacy of water management tools under different circumstances.},

Title = {Interactions between Climate Change and Infrastructure Projects in
   Changing Water Resources: An Ethnobiological Perspective from the
   Daasanach, Kenya},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {41},

Pages = {331-348},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The fast and widespread environmental changes that have intensified in
   the last decades are bringing disproportionate impacts to Indigenous
   Peoples and Local Communities. Changes that affect water resources are
   particularly relevant for subsistence-based peoples, many of whom
   already suffer from constraints regarding reliable access to safe water.
   Particularly in areas where water is scarce, climate change is expected
   to amplify existing stresses in water availability, which are also
   exacerbated by multiple socioeconomic drivers. In this paper, we look
   into the local perceptions of environmental change expressed by the
   Daasanach people of northern Kenya, where the impacts of climate change
   overlap with those brought by large infrastructure projects recently
   established in the Omo River. We show that the Daasanach have rich and
   detailed understanding of changes in their environment, especially in
   relation to water resources. Daasanach understand observations of change
   in different elements of the social-ecological system as an outcome of
   complex interactions between climatic and non-climatic drivers of
   change. Our findings highlight the perceived synergistic effects of
   climate change and infrastructure projects in water resources, driving
   multiple and cascading impacts on biophysical elements and local
   livelihoods. Our results also demonstrate the potential of Local
   Ecological Knowledge in enhancing the understanding of complex
   social-ecological issues, such as the impacts of environmental change in
   local communities. To minimize and mitigate the social-ecological
   impacts of development projects, it is essential to consider potential
   synergies between climatic and socioeconomic factors and to ensure
   inclusive governance rooted in local understandings of environmental
   change.},

Title = {Size and stochasticity in irrigated social-ecological systems},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAR 7},
Abstract = {This paper presents a systematic study of the relation between the size
   of irrigation systems and the management of uncertainty. We specifically
   focus on studying, through a stylized theoretical model, how
   stochasticity in water availability and taxation interacts with the
   stochastic behavior of the population within irrigation systems. Our
   results indicate the existence of two key population thresholds for the
   sustainability of any irrigation system: N-c{*} or the critical
   population size required to keep the irrigation system operative, and
   N{*} or the population threshold at which the incentive to work inside
   the irrigation system equals the incentives to work elsewhere. Crossing
   N-c{*} irretrievably leads to system collapse. N{*} is the population
   level with a sub-optimal per capita payoff towards which irrigation
   systems tend to gravitate. When subjected to strong stochasticity in
   water availability or taxation, irrigation systems might suffer sharp
   population drops and irreversibly disintegrate into a system collapse,
   via a mechanism we dub `collapse trap'. Our conceptual study establishes
   the basis for further work aiming at appraising the dynamics between
   size and stochasticity in irrigation systems, whose understanding is key
   for devising mitigation and adaptation measures to ensure their
   sustainability in the face of increasing and inevitable uncertainty.},

Title = {Facilitation Model for Supporting Integrative Water Resource Management},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {13},
Pages = {4913-4931},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this paper, the Soft Systems Methodology foundations was integrated
   to a water resources management model to construct a facilitation
   process to support integrative water resources management. The
   facilitation model aims to achieve agreements over conflicts, by
   promoting engagement of actors to construct a common and holistic
   understanding about the problematic situation through an interactive,
   participative, clear, and transparent process. The facilitation model is
   divided into two phases: (i) Preparing Logistics and (ii) Work meeting.
   The first phase starts when a conflict emerges, then, the facilitator
   should prepare the logistics necessary to proceed with the examination
   of the problem, including the selection of volunteers who will compose
   the work group. The second phase is intended to the application of an
   interactive and participatory modeling approach organized into five
   steps: 1 - Expressing the problematic situation; 2 - Constructing a
   multi-sectoral representation; 3 - Examining the multi-sectoral
   representation; 4 - Building a conceptual model; and 5 - Exploring
   actions. To illustrate its application, we applied these steps to
   structure a real complex problematic situation that exists in an area of
   the watershed of the Paraiba do Norte River, in Northeastern Brazil. To
   construct a multi-sectoral representation of the problem, perspectives
   of different actors who are involved in the problem were considered. We
   conclude that the model is a powerful tool for the analysis of complex
   problems, for which there is no consensus regarding alternatives to
   solve/mitigate it and/or there is a high level of uncertainties involved
   in the decision-making process.},

Abstract = {Natural resources management in general, and water resources management
   in particular, are currently undergoing a major paradigm shift.
   Management practices have largely been developed and implemented by
   experts using technical means based on designing systems that can be
   predicted and controlled. In recent years, stakeholder involvement has
   gained increasing importance. Collaborative governance is considered to
   be more appropriate for integrated and adaptive management regimes
   needed to cope with the complexity of social-ecological systems. The
   paper presents a concept for social learning and collaborative
   governance developed in the European project HarmoniCOP ( Harmonizing
   COllaborative Planning). The concept is rooted in the more interpretive
   strands of the social sciences emphasizing the context dependence of
   knowledge. The role of frames and boundary management in processes of
   learning at different levels and time scales is investigated. The
   foundation of social learning as investigated in the HarmoniCOP project
   is multiparty collaboration processes that are perceived to be the
   nuclei of learning processes. Such processes take place in networks or
   ``communities of practice{''} and are influenced by the governance
   structure in which they are embedded. Requirements for social learning
   include institutional settings that guarantee some degree of stability
   and certainty without being rigid and inflexible. Our analyses, which
   are based on conceptual considerations and empirical insights, suggest
   that the development of such institutional settings involves continued
   processes of social learning. In these processes, stakeholders at
   different scales are connected in flexible networks that allow them to
   develop the capacity and trust they need to collaborate in a wide range
   of formal and informal relationships ranging from formal legal
   structures and contracts to informal, voluntary agreements.},

Abstract = {The watershed has long captured political and scientific imaginations
   and served as a primary socio-spatial unit of water governance and
   ecosystem restoration. However, uncritically deploying watersheds for
   collaborative environmental governance in indigenous territories may
   inappropriately frame socio-cultural, political-economic, and ecological
   processes, and overlook questions related to power and scale. We analyse
   how members of the Karuk Tribe's Department of Natural Resources have
   leveraged and critiqued collaborative watershed governance initiatives
   to push for `ecocultural revitalisation' - the linked processes of
   ecosystem repair and cultural revitalisation - in Karuk Aboriginal
   Territory in the Klamath River Basin. We argue for decentring watersheds
   in relation to other socio-spatial formations that are generated through
   indigenous-led processes and grounded in indigenous knowledge and
   values. We explore two scalar frameworks - firesheds and foodsheds -
   that are emerging as alternatives to the watershed for collaborative
   natural resources management, and consider their implications for Karuk
   ecocultural revitalisation. We attempt to bring watersheds, firesheds,
   and foodsheds together through an ecocultural approach to scale in which
   water is one among many cultural and natural resources that are
   interconnected and managed across multiple socio-spatial formations and
   temporal ranges. We emphasise `decolonising scale' to foreground
   indigenous knowledge and to support indigenous sovereignty and
   self-determination.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {To gain insights on long-term social-ecological resilience, we examined
   adaptive responses of small-scale societies to dryland-related hazards
   in different regions and chronological periods, spanning from the
   mid-Holocene to the present. Based on evidence from Africa (Sahara and
   Sahel), Asia (south margin of the Thar desert), and Europe (South
   Spain), we discuss key traits and coping practices of small-scale
   societies that are potentially relevant for building resilience. The
   selected case studies illustrate four main coping mechanisms: mobility
   and migration, storage, commoning, and collective action driven by
   religious beliefs. Ultimately, the study of resilience in the context of
   drylands emphasizes the importance of adaptive traits and practices that
   are distinctive of small-scale societies: a strong social-ecological
   coupling, a solid body of traditional ecological knowledge, and a high
   degree of internal cohesion and self-organization.},

Title = {Facilitating Transitional Processes in Rigid Institutional Regimes for
   Water Management and Wetland Conservation: Experience from the
   Guadalquivir Estuary},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Traditional policies for water resources management and wetland
   conservation are often based on command-and-control approaches. The
   latter tend to drive the human-wetland-water system into pathological
   states, characterized by more vulnerable ecosystems and rigid
   institutions for governance. The overcoming of these states may rest in
   the development of flexible and adaptive institutional regimes that rely
   on adaptive governance and management. Because past factors might
   constrain the implementation of more flexible adaptive approaches to
   management, it is important to understand the historical mechanisms
   underlying the genesis of institutional rigidity. We first present the
   results of a historical analysis of Do ana, which can be characterized
   as a pathological water socio-ecosystem governed through rigid
   institutional regimes for water resources management and wetland
   conservation. In a second step, we analyze the advances achieved during
   a recent, large-scale restoration program for the Donana wetlands, which
   adhered explicitly to the tenets of adaptive management. Our analysis
   indicated that the historical persistence of command-and-control
   approaches has been a path-dependent process that led to the emergence
   of a rigid institutional regime and caused it to enter a rigidity trap.
   However, the achievements of the restoration program suggest that a more
   flexible and adaptive regime could be developed through the introduction
   of adaptive management at the operational levels, using specifically
   tailored action research programs. To conclude, we speculate that the
   research strategy outlined could be extended to comply with, or
   complement, the requirements of the EU's Water Framework Directive in
   other European water socio-ecosystems.},

Title = {Losing Aguacate: <i>What If Water Costs Kill Avocado Farming in San
   Diego County?</i>},
Journal = {CASE STUDIES IN THE ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {San Diego County is categorized as urban, yet it was one of only three
   counties in the United States with over 5,000 farm operations in 2017.
   While continuing to expand its urban area, the county lost farmland at
   the rate of 3.8\% every year between 2002 and 2017. By several measures,
   avocado production is the county's most important crop, and avocado
   groves account for about 30\% of all crops planted there. Avocado
   acreage is also declining rapidly in the county, at about 3\% each year.
   To understand the dynamics influencing the decrease in avocado acreage,
   we explored the issue with avocado growers in San Diego County at the
   height of a drought in 2016. Water-resource related issues-especially
   the cost of water-were identified as the most important issues facing
   avocado growers, but other socioeconomic and environmental factors
   driving change were also identified. Drought conditions have continued
   in the years since, and this study highlights the ongoing challenges
   facing farmers in arid regions and potential broader cultural, economic,
   and aesthetic changes influenced by their decisions. It reflects upon
   the question of what happens if these factors continue to eat away at
   avocado farming in the county. After reading this case study, readers
   will gain insights into key drivers of land-use decisions among farmers
   on the urban fringe, including environmental and climactic factors, as
   well as implications for regional cultural values and larger economic
   and social trends.},

   Planning: A Systematic Literature Review},

Abstract = {Groundwater is one of the main resources for social-ecological systems.
   As part of the total water cycle and deeply connected with land use,
   groundwater management faces many challenges, especially in coastal
   areas. Landscape Scale Planning is an emerging approach for land use
   planning providing a framework for management based on evidence, given
   that landscapes have physical and information flows. Landscape Scale
   Planning embraces the following three dimensions: (i) the spatial
   dimension centres on the recognition of distinct landscape units; (ii)
   the temporal dimension entails past, current and future uses of a
   landscape; and (iii) the modification dimension involves the
   anthropogenic alterations that affected and will affect the landscape
   and its features along the spatial and temporal dimensions. Through a
   systematic literature review of 28 selected publications, this paper
   explores how groundwater management can be improved through a Landscape
   Scale Planning approach. The results show that Landscape Scale Planning
   can be applied as an integrative framework for groundwater management.
   Landscape units based on, but not limited to, geology, topography,
   cultural and socio-economic aspects can aid groundwater management to
   consider the differing spatial and temporal characteristics of the
   aquifer. Landscape Scale Planning can also favour the inclusion of land
   use change dynamics in groundwater management processes. To this end,
   the paper proposes guidelines for applying Landscape Scale Planning to
   inform groundwater management and consider land use changes.},

Abstract = {This chapter synthesizes the research needs presented in the book and
   proposes actions for addressing them. It highlights the socioeconomic
   and biophysical characteristics, development, production and consumption
   patterns, challenges and threats and management approaches that were
   discussed in the preceding chapters and discusses the priorities for
   future Lake Tana basin research that were raised. The analysis shows
   that the basin has many unique features, and great potential for
   sustainable development, especially in water resources. The lake and
   basin provide multiple benefits to the local community, the region and
   downstream riparian countries. Many of the problematic trends in the
   region result from an imbalance between resource production and
   consumption patterns, and limited or poorly implemented conservation
   measures. The many and complex challenges and threats in the basin are
   caused, in part, by the lack of an integrated basin plan and poor
   collaborative mechanisms to share data and find sustainable solutions.
   The available data and information about the basin is limited. It is not
   well-organized, accessible, or used well for the basin's resource
   management. The identification of major research gaps and priorities for
   future research highlighted in this book, as well as the systems
   framework for integration and collaboration, provide a basis for further
   research and policy decisions to promote sustainability in the region.},

Title = {Screening regional management options for their impact on climate
   resilience: an approach and case study in the Venen-Vechtstreek wetlands
   in the Netherlands},
Journal = {SPRINGERPLUS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUN 17},
Abstract = {Freshwater systems provide various resources and services. These are
   often vulnerable to climate change and other pressures. Therefore,
   enhancing resilience to climate change is important for their long term
   viability. This paper explores how management options can be evaluated
   on their resilience implications. The approach included five steps: (1)
   characterizing the system, (2) characterizing the impacts of climate
   change and other disturbances, (3) inventorying management options, (4)
   assessing the impacts of these on climate resilience, and (5) follow-up
   analysis. For the resilience assessment, we used a set of `resilience
   principles': homeostasis, omnivory, high flux, flatness, buffering, and
   redundancy. We applied the approach in a case study in a Dutch wetlands
   region. Many options in the region's management plan contribute to
   resilience, however, the plan underutilised several principles,
   particularly flatness, but also redundancy and omnivory for agriculture,
   and high flux for nature. Co-benefits was identified as an important
   additional criterion to obtain support for adaptation from local
   stakeholders, such as farmers. The approach provided a relatively quick
   and participatory way to screen options. It allowed us to consider
   multiple impacts and sectors, multiple dimensions of resilience, and
   stakeholder perspectives. The results can be used to identify gaps or
   pitfalls, and set priorities for follow-up analyses.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {28},

Pages = {212-222},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Small-scale irrigation systems are important for agricultural
   productivity in dryland agroecosystems, particularly in areas where
   there is significant intra- and interannual changes in rainfall
   patterns. Institutional analysis of common-pool resources has
   demonstrated the principles that tend to result in sustained water
   governance systems. However, previous work did not fully articulate the
   nested nature of institutions and how polycentric arrangements can play
   a role in both the formation and the ongoing maintenance of these
   governance systems. To better understand collective action across water
   user groups and decision-makers at multiple governance levels, we
   undertake a multilevel analysis of Kenya's polycentric approach to water
   governance, in place since reforms were initiated in 2002. Survey and
   interview data indicate that in the postreform period, water users in
   Kenya's Upper Ewaso Ng'iro basin engaged in behaviors associated with
   collective action, including reduced water use by upstream users to
   address downstream users' needs. We examine the factors that promote
   collective action in the region, asking whether features associated with
   polycentric governance have helped to promote collective action. We find
   that the presence of multiple decision centers with overlapping
   authority over water governance functions creates necessarybut not
   sufficientconditions for collective action to occur. Regulations and
   formal conflict resolution mechanisms provide incentives for water users
   to cooperate, while shared membership in regional Water Resource Users
   Associations facilitates informal opportunities for users to share
   information and build trust over time.},

Title = {The unfolding water drama in the Anthropocene: towards a

Abstract = {The human influence on the global hydrological cycle is now the dominant
   force behind changes in water resources across the world and in
   regulating the resilience of the Earth system. The rise in human
   pressures on global freshwater resources is in par with other
   anthropogenic changes in the Earth system (from climate to ecosystem
   change), which has prompted science to suggest that humanity has entered
   a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. This paper focuses on the
   critical role of water for resilience of social-ecological systems
   across scales, by avoiding major regime shifts away from stable
   environmental conditions, and in safeguarding life-support systems for
   human wellbeing. It highlights the dramatic increase of water crowding:
   near-future challenges for global water security and expansion of food
   production in competition with carbon sequestration and biofuel
   production. It addresses the human alterations of rainfall stability,
   due to both land-use changes and climate change, the ongoing overuse of
   blue water, reflected in river depletion, expanding river basin closure,
   groundwater overexploitation and water pollution risks. The rising water
   turbulence in the Anthropocene changes the water research and policy
   agenda, from a water-resource efficiency to a water resilience focus.
   This includes integrated land and water stewardship to sustain
   wetness-dependent ecological functions at the landscape scale and a
   stronger emphasis on green water management for ecosystem services. A
   new paradigm of water governance emerges, encouraging land-use practices
   that explicitly take account of the multifunctional roles of water, with
   adequate attention to planetary freshwater boundaries and cross-scale
   interactions. (c) 2014 The Authors. Ecohydrology published by John Wiley

Abstract = {Improved stormwater management for the protection of water resources
   requires bottom-up stewardship from landowners, including adoption of
   Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI). We use a statewide survey of
   Vermont paired with a cross-scale and spatial analysis to evaluate the
   influence of interacting spatial, social, and physical factors on
   residential intention to adopt GSI across a complex social-ecological
   landscape. Specifically, we focus on how three GSI practices, ({''}rain
   garden (bio retention),{''} ``infiltration trenches,{''} and ``actively
   divert roof runoff to a rain barrel/lawn/garden instead of the
   street/sewer{''}) vary with barriers to adoption, and household
   attributes across stormwater contexts from the household to watershed
   scale. Private landowners, who may be motivated more by on-site and
   neighborhood stormwater problems, may gravitate toward practices like
   infiltration trenches compared with practices (e.g., rain gardens)
   perceived to serve stormwater function over larger areas. Diversion of
   roof runoff was found to be more likely to be a part of a larger
   assembly of green behaviors. Improved stormwater management outcomes at
   the watershed, town, neighborhood, and household levels depend on
   adaptive approaches and adjusting strategies along the rural-urban
   gradient, across the biophysical landscape, and according to varying
   norms and institutional arrangements.},

Title = {Assessment of flood management systems' flexibility with application to
   the Sacramento River basin, California, USA},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Pages = {271-284},
Abstract = {Water resources managers and researchers have concluded that increasing
   system flexibility will provide flood management systems advantages in
   meeting objectives under uncertain future hydrologic conditions.
   However, despite the frequent use of the term flexibility, demonstration
   of the concept to analysis and design of flood management systems has
   yet to be conducted. Building upon previous studies of flexibility in
   the fields of information technology and social-ecological systems,
   among others, we outline an approach to investigate how structural and
   non-structural flood management actions relate to system flexibility. We
   assess flexibility using metrics that describe flexibility by five
   characteristics: slack, redundancy, connectivity, adjustability, and
   compatibility/cooperation. We apply this flexibility assessment to four
   proposed flood management strategies, each with a unique suite of
   management actions, for the Sacramento River basin in California, USA.
   The foci of benefits differ between the four different flood management
   strategies, with varying emphasis on protecting urban communities, rural
   and agricultural improvements, and ecosystem restoration. The suite of
   proposed structural and non-structural actions has the potential to
   increase all five flexibility characteristics, though only a selection
   of actions are included in each of the four management strategies. The
   flexibility assessment reveals a disproportionate emphasis in all
   strategies on increasing slack in the current system as well as a
   concentration of expenditures towards structural versus non-structural
   components. Only two of the assessed strategies improve all five
   flexibility characteristics, and these two strategies also include the
   greatest number of actions that provide flexibility benefits. We do not
   find a clear link between these more flexible strategies and their time
   and cost-effectiveness in terms of reduction in damages. The outlined
   method provides a useful tool for comparing the flexibility of potential
   management strategies, and further application can provide more insight
   into broader thinking on flood management under uncertainty.},

Title = {More Than a Service: Values of Rivers, Wetlands and Floodplains Are
   Informed by Both Function and Feeling},

Abstract = {How people value rivers, wetlands and floodplains influences their
   attitudes, beliefs and behaviours towards these ecosystems, and can
   shape policy and management interventions. Better understanding why
   people value rivers, wetlands and floodplains and their key ecosystem
   components, such as vegetation, helps to determine what factors underpin
   the social legitimacy required for effective management of these
   systems. This study sought to ascertain perspectives on the value of
   non-woody vegetation in river-floodplain systems via an online survey.
   The survey found that participants valued non-woody vegetation for their
   provision of a range of ecosystem functions and services, with strong
   emphasis on ecological aspects such as regulation functions, habitat
   provision and biodiversity. However, the inclusion of a question framed
   to focus on stories or narratives resulted in a different emphasis.
   Responses indicated that non-woody vegetation, and rivers, wetlands and
   floodplains were valued for the way they made people feel through lived
   experiences such as recreational activities, personal interactions with
   nature, educational and research experiences. This highlights the
   important role of storytelling in navigating complex natural resource
   management challenges and ascertaining a deeper understanding of values
   that moves beyond provision of function to feeling. Improved
   understanding of the diverse ways people value and interact with
   river-floodplain systems will help develop narratives and forms of
   engagement that foster shared understanding, empathy and collaboration.
   Appreciation of plural values such as the provision of functions and
   services along with the role of emotional connections and lived
   experience will likely increase lasting engagement of the general public
   with management to protect and restore river-floodplain systems.},

Title = {Identifying user needs for weather and climate services to enhance
   resilience to climate shocks in sub-Saharan Africa},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},

Abstract = {The vulnerability of social-ecological systems in sub-Saharan Africa
   (SSA) to climate variability and change means that there is an urgent
   need to better integrate weather and climate information into societal
   decision-making processes. Long-term climate adaptation in these regions
   has received increasing attention, with recent initiatives aiming to
   increase resilience to climate change at timescales of years to decades.
   Less focus has been given to weather and short-term climate information.
   However, users are principally interested in shorter timescales (hours
   to seasons) where actions can immediately reduce the impacts of severe
   weather events. Focusing on the priority sectors of agriculture and food
   security, water and disaster management, this paper uses a systematic
   literature review approach to analyse 61 empirical case studies drawn
   from academic literature and projects across SSA. We identify the main
   users of climate services and outline current practices and reported
   benefits. Barriers that impede the delivery and uptake of climate
   services are identified and potential strategies for overcoming them
   outlined based on the reporting of successful practices. Our findings
   show that greater capacity building of personnel working for National
   Meteorological and Hydrological Services and Agricultural Extension
   staff and reinforcing and sustaining collaboration between different
   stakeholders (climate scientists, hydrologists, extension workers,
   farmers and other user groups), are essential factors for improving the
   uptake and utility of weather and climate services to enhance resilience
   to climate shocks in SSA.},

Abstract = {Linked social-ecological systems in which surprise and crisis are
   interspersed with periods of stability and predictability are inherently
   difficult to manage. This condition, coupled with the legacies of past
   management actions, typically leaves policy and decision makers few
   options other than to incrementally adapt and reinforce the current
   trajectory of the system. Decision making becomes increasingly reactive
   and incremental as the system moves from one crisis to another.
   Eventually the system loses its capacity to cope with perturbations and
   surprise. Using a combination of dynamical-systems modeling and
   historical analysis, we studied a process of this kind as it developed
   in the Goulburn Broken Catchment in southeastern Australia over the past
   150 years. Using the model to simulate trajectories of the
   biohydrological system, we correlate the state of the physical system to
   historical events and management action. We show how sequential
   management decisions have eroded the resilience of the system (its
   ability to cope with shocks and surprises) and reduced options for
   future change. Using the model in a forward-looking mode, we explore
   future management options and their implications for the resilience of
   the system.},

Title = {Enacting resilience for adaptive water governance: a case study of
   irrigation modernization in an Australian catchment},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Adaptive governance relies on the collaboration of a diverse set of
   stakeholders in multiple institutions and organizations at different
   times and places. In the context of unprecedented water policy and
   management reform in Australia over the past decade, we add to insights
   from resilience scholarship, which identifies adaptive governance as
   critical to improving complex social- ecological systems, such as water
   management. We present empirical research with agricultural industry
   stakeholders who are responding to a major change initiative to renew or
   modernize the largest irrigation system in Australia's Murray Darling
   Basin and who ask: `` What can a resilience assessment intervention
   contribute to adaptive water governance in this context?{''} Using
   resilience approaches and connecting these with insights from science
   and technology studies (STS), we found that a particular resilience
   assessment intervention supported dairy industry stakeholders to manage
   the complexity, uncertainty, and diversity of an irrigation
   modernization governance challenge. It did so by explicitly accounting
   for, representing, and aligning different water governing practices
   through the use of resilience concepts, a particular resilience
   assessment tool, and a participatory process for engaging social actors.
   Possibilities for adaptive governance emerged from the intervention in
   the form of new joint strategic actions and new understandings,
   alliances, and roles between people and institutions for addressing
   irrigation modernization.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {223},
Pages = {731-742},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Catchments are complex social-ecological systems involving multiple, and
   often competing, interests. Water governance and management regimes are
   increasingly embracing pluralistic, participatory, and holistic norms as
   a means to engage with issues of complexity, uncertainty, and
   value-conflicts. Integrated, participatory approaches are theoretically
   linked to improved learning amongst stakeholders across sectors and
   decision-making that is grounded in shared knowledge, experiences and
   scientific evidence. However, few studies have empirically examined the
   impacts of an integrated approach to learning and knowledge practices
   related to water resources. Here, a Swedish sub-catchment that has
   adopted such an approach in association with implementation of the
   European Water Framework Directive (WFD) is examined. Interview-based
   analyses show that WFD implementation has both helped and hindered
   learning and knowledge practices surrounding both water planning and
   spatial planning. Whilst communities of practice have developed in the
   study area, a number of important challenges remain. These include the
   rigid goal-orientation of the WFD, the fragmentation of knowledge caused
   by an over-reliance on external consultants, as well as a lack of
   resources to synthesise information from multiple sources. Present
   results raise questions regarding the efficacy of the WFD to
   sufficiently enable the development of learning and knowledge practices
   capable of handling the complexity, uncertainties and value-conflicts
   facing catchments in Sweden and elsewhere.},

Title = {Integrating the social, hydrological and ecological dimensions of

Abstract = {Degradation of freshwater ecosystems and the services they provide is a
   primary cause of increasing water insecurity, raising the need for
   integrated solutions to freshwater management. While methods for
   characterizing the multifaceted challenges of managing freshwater
   ecosystems abound, they tend to emphasize either social or ecological
   dimensions and fall short of being truly integrative. This paper
   suggests that management for sustainability of freshwater systems needs
   to consider the linkages between human water uses, freshwater ecosystems
   and governance. We present a conceptualization of freshwater resources
   as part of an integrated social-ecological system and propose a set of
   corresponding indicators to monitor freshwater ecosystem health and to
   highlight priorities for management. We demonstrate an application of
   this new framework - the Freshwater Health Index (FHI) - in the
   Dongjiang River Basin in southern China, where stakeholders are
   addressing multiple and conflicting freshwater demands. By combining
   empirical and modeled datasets with surveys to gauge stakeholders'
   preferences and elicit expert information about governance mechanisms,
   the FHI helps stakeholders understand the status of freshwater
   ecosystems in their basin, how ecosystems are being manipulated to
   enhance or decrease water-related services, and howwell the existing
   water resource management regime is equipped to govern these dynamics
   over time. This framework helps to operationalize a truly integrated
   approach to water resource management by recognizing the interplay
   between governance, stakeholders, freshwater ecosystems and the services
   they provide. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Modeling the impact of social network measures on institutional adaptive
   capacity needed for sustainable governance of water resources},
Journal = {NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {33},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Given the hydrological, social, and economic complexity of water
   resources, planning for evaluation of such resources is extremely
   challenging. The vulnerability and limitations of water resources in one
   hand, and the growing demand on the other hand necessitates integrated
   planning for resource protection. Accordingly, applying Smart partial
   least squares software for structural equation modeling using the
   partial least square path modeling, the impact of social network
   measures upon the adaptive capacity of organizational stakeholders faced
   with water scarcity in industries of Kerman Province was scrutinized in
   the present study. To investigate the structural position of actors
   (organizational stakeholders) within the social network, relevant data
   was extracted and thereafter used to estimate the dependent variables of
   research (dimensions of adaptation). It was found out that there is
   significant correlation between the measures of stakeholders' network
   and the adaptive capacity. Closeness centrality (access to information
   sources related to water) was found to have the strongest effect on fair
   governance and leadership, necessary for higher adaptive capacity. On
   the contrary, betweenness centrality (revealing intermediary actors
   capable of consensus building) was found to have a negative effect on
   the adaptive capacity. In other words, better access to the flow of
   information related to water resources enhances the adaptive capacity of
   stakeholders but the presence of actors of high betweenness centrality,
   who are reluctant to an adaptive governance system, decreases adaptive
   capacity. Recommendations for Resource Managers: Establishment of a
   polycentric governance system that requires power sharing, coordination,
   and collaboration of all involved actors and stakeholders. Considering
   water rights in exploiting water resources. Instructing and educating
   executive managers of water industry projects for increasing adaptive
   capacity against water scarcity. Creating integrated watershed
   management. Development of social network analysis knowledge for
   analyzing the relationships of stakeholders and the governance network
   of natural resources and environment.},

Abstract = {In the Arctic and Subarctic, the contribution of Indigenous knowledge to
   understanding environmental change has been established over the last
   several decades. This paper explores the role of Indigenous knowledge of
   water in understanding hydrologic change within complex
   social-ecological systems. Observations of hydrology in the Yukon River
   Basin, contributed by 20 community experts from Ruby Village, Alaska, in
   semi-structured interviews, are compared with findings from scientific
   literature to illustrate the commonalities and differences. Research
   findings reveal the contribution of Indigenous knowledge to
   understandings of hydrologic change in the Yukon River and its
   tributaries, which includes insights regarding alterations in sediment
   and river ice regimes. Recommendations for future research that
   incorporates Indigenous knowledge of water to gain insight into
   hydrologic changes in the watershed include combining multiple case
   studies that are distributed geographically. Our findings suggest 1)
   that using participatory research approaches to research will help
   ensure that it benefits the communities whose livelihoods are affected
   by hydrologic changes, and 2) that a multidisciplinary approach that
   combines qualitative and quantitative methods from the social and
   biophysical sciences would be most effective to help us understand and
   respond to hydrologic changes.},

Abstract = {The Columbia River Basin is a complex social-ecological system, spanning
   political, legal, socio-economic, geographic, and biophysical
   boundaries. Outreach to others in social networks develops fundamental
   communications needed for sustainable collaborations in adaptive
   management. However, operationalizing and comparing measures of social
   processes and outcome success in biophysical indicators remains
   challenging for resource managers. Using survey-based research, we
   examined the interactions for water resource governance of five Columbia
   River reservoir basins in the northwestern US and Canada: Lakes Chelan,
   Roosevelt, Pend Oreille, Koocanusa, and clq'etkw (Flathead). Respondents
   included: water resource professionals working for Tribes/First Nations,
   federal, state, or provincial departments in water quality and/or
   fisheries, and people who engage in the networks on behalf of area
   businesses, government offices, public services, non-profit
   organizations, and other entities. Perceived social process metrics in
   these governance networks included the levels of collaboration and
   inclusiveness, common goals, common strategies, identifying issues,
   implementing action, and the adequacy of available scientific data. We
   evaluated social measures relative to participant-reported changes in
   physical lake health indicators. Qualitative data-enhanced understanding
   of basin-specific differences. Correlations of social by ecological
   measures varied widely between basins. Even moderate to strong
   functionality parameters did not scale well from individual to
   cross-basin levels, as many correlations vanished with data aggregated.
   However, data analysis at the basin scale revealed important variability
   across the region in scope and governance functionality. Process
   indicators such as identifying issues and implementing action yielded
   stronger relationships for 10-year horizons than for 2 years, reflecting
   the lag-time in resource action.},

Title = {A Livelihood Resilience Measurement Framework for Dam-Induced
   Displacement and Resettlement},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The concepts of resilience and livelihood resilience are growing in
   prominence with water resource development that aims to measure and
   build resilience to specific disturbances and shocks. However, practical
   frameworks to measure livelihood resilience are needed, not just a
   theoretical framework. In this paper, we introduce the livelihood
   resilience measurement (LRM) framework, which draws on Hooke's law; use
   the state vector method to calculate livelihood resilience scores; and
   test the effectiveness of the method by correlation analysis. We
   illustrate the framework by using it to measure livelihood resilience in
   Henan Province, China, and assess the strategies that build livelihood
   resilience. The advantages and limitations of the framework are explored
   and discussed by drawing on empirical examples. Besides illustrating how
   to apply the LRM framework in a practical case, we discuss how to
   communicate with stakeholders to identify and strengthen the factors
   that build resilience. In this study, land ownership, housing and
   property value, and emergency cost are the most significant of these
   factors. Thus, the LRM framework has the potential to help
   reservoir-affected families protect their livelihood capital and to help
   governments improve social welfare. It can thus serve as a tool for
   monitoring and improving the effectiveness of policies and practices
   aimed at building livelihood resilience.},

Abstract = {Ecosystems around the world generate a wide range of services. Often,
   there are trade-offs in ecosystem service provision. Managing such

   action situations where actors subtract from a flow of ESS. We
   classified ESSs in order to identify focal action situations and link
   them to ESS governance types which are likely to strengthen sustainable
   ecosystem management. The classification is applied to six forest cases
   in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
   Our results confirm that ecosystem management, which more strongly
   supports the provision of public goods and common pool resources, is
   often under strong pressure to be transformed into systems that mainly
   provide private goods. This can be partly explained by incentive
   constellations in the action situations of public goods and common pool
   resources. Therefore, governance has to be adapted to specific ESSs. ESS
   governance needs to identify institutions which best fit to different
   ESSs and to harmonize them for all the ESSs provided by the system. Our
   approach helps to understand why institutions fail or succeed in
   maintaining ESSs.},

Title = {Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the dimensions of farmers'
   adaptive capacity in the face of water scarcity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {199},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Previous studies have shown that enhancing adaptive capacity can reduce
   vulnerability of farmers to water scarcity and improve their resiliency
   against environmental changes in the Social-Ecological Systems (SES).
   The present study aims to evaluate, measure, and compare the dimensions
   of farmers' adaptive capacity in rural areas in west of Iran facing
   escalating water scarcity in the recent years. Since that adaptive
   capacity is a key factor in community resilience, the relationship
   between considered adaptive capacity dimensions with increasing
   resilience of the study area was also investigated. Furthermore, the
   influence and dependency of each item of the dimensions of adaptive
   capacity has been measured by the Cross Impact Analysis (CIA) method.
   For this purpose, 175 farmers in 6 villages in Borujerd County, Lorestan
   province, Iran were selected for examining the content, structure, and
   important dimensions of their adaptive capacity. Adopting the survey
   methodology, this study used the whole network approach to identify the
   agricultural water users in the ecologic boundaries of the selected
   villages. The t-values for the most important dimensions with highest
   effects on the adaptive capacity of the rural communities in the study
   area including ``water governance{''}, ``innovation{''} and
   ``information, and awareness{''} were 5.56, 5.49 and 4.15, respectively
   confirming the Structural Equations Modeling (SEM) and Friedman
   statistical test results. The t-values less than 1.96 for ``Local
   networks{''}, ``trust in government{''}, ``financial sources and
   infrastructures{''}, as well as ``adaptive management{''} showed
   insignificance of these dimensions in the adaptive capacity of farmers
   in the study area. Based on the results of the adaptive capacity
   analysis, suggestions for enhancing resilience of the farmer communities
   against water scarcity were provided.},

Title = {Disentangling Puzzles of Spatial Scales and Participation in
   Environmental Governance-The Case of Governance Re-scaling Through the
   European Water Framework Directive},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {58},
Number = {6},
Pages = {998-1014},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article attempts to shed new light on prevailing puzzles of spatial
   scales in multi-level, participatory governance as regards the
   democratic legitimacy and environmental effectiveness of governance
   systems. We focus on the governance re-scaling by the European Water
   Framework Directive, which introduced new governance scales (mandated
   river basin management) and demands consultation of citizens and
   encourages `active involvement' of stakeholders. This allows to examine
   whether and how re-scaling through deliberate governance interventions
   impacts on democratic legitimacy and effective environmental policy
   delivery. To guide the enquiry, this article organizes existing-partly
   contradictory-claims on the relation of scale, democratic legitimacy,
   and environmental effectiveness into three clusters of mechanisms,
   integrating insights from multi-level governance, social-ecological
   systems, and public participation. We empirically examine Water
   Framework Directive implementation in a comparative case study of
   multi-level systems in the light of the suggested mechanisms. We compare
   two planning areas in Germany: North Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony.
   Findings suggest that the Water Framework Directive did have some impact
   on institutionalizing hydrological scales and participation. Local
   participation appears generally both more effective and legitimate than
   on higher levels, pointing to the need for yet more tailored multi-level
   governance approaches, depending on whether environmental knowledge or
   advocacy is sought. We find mixed results regarding the potential of
   participation to bridge spatial `misfits' between ecological and
   administrative scales of governance, depending on the historical
   institutionalization of governance on ecological scales. Polycentricity,
   finally, appeared somewhat favorable in effectiveness terms with some
   distinct differences regarding polycentricity in planning vs.
   polycentricity in implementation.},

Title = {Understanding the governance of sustainability pathways: hydraulic
   megaprojects, social-ecological traps, and power in networks of action
   situations},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {303-321},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {To enable sustainability pathways, we need to understand how
   social-ecological systems (SES) respond to different governance
   configurations, considering their historical, institutional, political,
   and power conditions. We advance a robust methodological approach for
   the integrated analysis of those conditions in SES traps. Our
   advancement consists of a novel combination of the networks of action
   situations approach with an agency-based polycentric power typology and
   the concept of discursive power. We test the approach by building on
   previous research on the Donana estuary-delta SES (Guadalquivir
   estuary), which is characterized by a rigidity trap in the context of
   ecosystem and water governance. Specifically, we focus on a recent
   hydraulic megaproject involving deep dredging in the Guadalquivir
   estuary, finally canceled due to its broad negative socioeconomic and
   environmental repercussions. According to our analysis, certain
   governance, institutional, and informational mechanisms currently
   prevent further SES degradation in Donana. However, key governance
   actors are caught in a lasting coordination failure prone to mutual
   defection strategies owing to power dynamics and
   discursive-institutional inertia. Although seemingly stable due to
   counteractive mechanisms among actors, this situation is at continuous
   risk of being unbalanced by powerful actors promoting large SES
   interventions such as deep dredging. Such interventions bear the
   systemic risk of strong suppression of SES functions, and a regime shift
   to a lock-in trap. This overall undesirable situation might be escaped
   through transformative policy designs that take into account meso-level
   mechanisms, such as discursive power and its role in
   non-decision-making, pragmatic inaction, and inefficient investment and
   infrastructure.},

Title = {The evolving role of government in the adaptive governance of freshwater
   social-ecological systems in the western US},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {77},
Pages = {40-48},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The role of government within the western United States is shifting, as
   government command and control policies inadequately address freshwater
   management complexity. As growing human and environmental needs
   intensify water resource governance challenges, government is
   increasingly combining existing regulatory structures with collaborative
   exchange mechanisms, such as Investments in Watershed Services (IWS). We
   explored the changing role of government through IWS in the west, a
   region that holds one of the highest concentrations of IWS globally.
   Through a survey, we collected and analysed information on the influence
   of government in IWS. All 48 identified IWS contained some form of
   government presence: as program participants, regulation drivers, or
   land managers, and in both voluntary and regulatory contexts. Government
   influence on IWS varies across water issue (in-stream flow, water
   quality, and source water protection), and level of government (local,
   state and federal). Our work demonstrates how the government is
   expanding its roles and responsibilities, moving beyond historic command
   and control roles to support and facilitate new mechanisms. Although
   most government presence in early IWS was regulatory, local, state and
   federal governments are increasingly participating directly in IWS.
   State government have expanded regulatory structures for instream flow,
   and federal and local government are collaborating in source water
   protection. We found that government is reactionary, pragmatic, and
   incremental in their responses to water management. Our work provides
   the first government-specific analysis of IWS in the western US, and
   provides insights into the evolving role of government in adaptive
   governance of freshwater resources.},

Title = {Effective livelihood adaptation to climate change disturbance: Scale

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Natural resource-dependent societies in developing countries are facing
   increased pressures linked to global climate change. While
   social-ecological systems evolve to accommodate variability, there is
   growing evidence that changes in drought, storm and flood extremes are
   increasing exposure of currently vulnerable populations. In many
   countries in Africa, these pressures are compounded by disruption to
   institutions and variability in livelihoods and income. The interactions
   of both rapid and slow onset livelihood disturbance contribute to
   enduring poverty and slow processes of rural livelihood renewal across a
   complex landscape. We explore cross-scale dynamics in coping and
   adaptation response, drawing on qualitative data from a case study in
   Mozambique. The research characterises the engagements across multiple
   institutional scales and the types of agents involved, providing insight
   into emergent conditions for adaptation to climate change in rural
   economies, The analysis explores local responses to climate shocks, food
   security and poverty reduction, through informal institutions, forms of
   livelihood diversification and collective land-use systems that allow
   reciprocity, flexibility and the ability to buffer shocks. However, the
   analysis shows that agricultural initiatives have helped to facilitate
   effective livelihood renewal, through the reorganisation of social
   institutions and opportunities for communication, innovation and
   micro-credit. Although there are challenges to mainstreaming adaptation
   at different scales, this research shows why it is critical to assess
   how policies can protect conditions for emergence of livelihood
   transformation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Towards a systems approach for river basin management-Lessons from
   Australia's largest river},

Abstract = {Globally, large river systems have been extensively modified and are
   increasingly managed for a range of purposes including ecosystem
   services and ecological values. Key to managing rivers effectively are
   developing approaches that deal with uncertainty, are adaptive in
   nature, and can incorporate multiple stakeholders with dynamic
   feedbacks. Australia's largest river system, the Murray-Darling Basin
   (MDB), has been extensively developed for shipping passage, irrigation,
   hydroelectric development, and water supply. Water development in the
   MDB over the last century resulted in overallocation of water resources
   and large-scale environmental degradation throughout the Basin. Under
   the pressure of a significant drought, there was insufficient water to
   supply critical human, environmental, and agricultural needs. In
   response, a massive programme of water reform was enacted that resulted
   in considerable institutional, social, and economic change. The
   underlying policy was required to be enacted in an absence of certainty
   around the scientific basis, with an adaptive management focus to
   incorporate new knowledge. The resulting institutional arrangements were
   challenged by a need to generate new governance arrangements within the
   constraints of existing state and national structures. The ongoing
   reform and management of the MDB continues to challenge all parties to
   achieve optimization for multiple outcomes, and to communicate that
   effectively. As large-scale water reform gains pace globally, the MDB
   provides a window of insight into the types of systems that may emerge
   and the challenges in working within them. Most particularly, it
   illustrates the need for much more sophisticated systems thinking that
   runs counter to the much more linear approaches often adopted in
   government.},

Title = {Thinking outside the ``water box{''} in the Detroit River Area of
   Concern},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {46},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1726-1739},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Despite sustained attention to water resource issues in the Great Lakes
   and around the world, many water problems remain unresolved because
   their sources or causes are external to the water sector. Water
   governance often is based on water-centric problem framings that do not
   take sufficient account of the role of external actors, institutions,
   and drivers. Recognition of this problem is growing, but identifying
   external connections and addressing the critical ones is challenging for
   water managers. Using a flexible diagnostic process, we explore external
   factors that are relevant in the context of the Detroit River Area of
   Concern (AOC) between Canada and the United States. We used a two-case
   multiple case study research design, triangulating data gathered from 28
   key informant interviews, review of 58 documents, and personal
   observations. We find that the AOC program is intentionally
   narrowly-focused to achieve its objectives, and that a water-centric
   perspective may in fact be needed for delisting the Detroit River as an
   AOC. However, there are broader issues beyond those considered in the
   AOC process that affect the river, including climate change, invasive
   species, population and land use change, shifting public perceptions,
   and an unstable institutional environment. To address these external
   challenges, practitioners should consider engaging more proactively with
   the topic of ``life after delisting{''}, and connecting more strongly
   with existing initiatives and networks in the area with the help of
   ``boundary spanners.{''} Strengthening binational ties within the AOC,
   and clarifying the role of AOCs in the large governance environment are
   also important. (C) 2020 International Association for Great Lakes

Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2020},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The governance of the commons depends on collective action by resource
   users, which may be influenced by land use dynamics and changes in
   livelihood. We examine the case of China that has experienced massive
   outmigration of its rural population and significant changes to its land
   use policy. We contribute to the literature by examining the interaction
   effects of farmland use rights trading and rural labor out migration on
   collective action for the governance of the irrigation commons, which
   has the potential to open up a new line of theoretical and empirical
   inquiry. Using the socio-ecological system framework, we run ordered
   probit regression based on data from a survey of 125 villages in 18
   provinces in China. We find that a moderate degree of farmland use
   rights trading has a positive effect on collective action for the
   governance of the irrigation commons and can slow down and mitigate the
   negative effect of rural labor outmigration. We conclude with
   implications for land use policy and governance of the commons.},

   approach: observations and lessons from 11 case studies of river basin
   organizations},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {One of the prescriptions for adaptive comanagement of social-ecological
   systems is to follow a bioregional approach. In water resources
   management, experience has been gained with a bioregional approach by
   the foundation of river basin organizations (RBOs). Here, we summarize
   the results of a research project involving 27 colleagues who have
   undertaken an analysis of the global discussion on RBOs and the
   foundation of RBOs in Canada, USA, Great Britain, Germany, Portugal,
   South Africa, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Mongolia, Thailand, and Australia.
   Drawing on Ostrom's institutional analysis and development framework, we
   first present a fine-grained analysis of the institutional architecture
   of these RBOs, which enables us to distinguish between autonomous,
   coordinating, partnership, and agency type RBOs. Second, we unravel the
   main controversies over this architecture by focusing on the key actors
   involved in either promoting or hindering RBO formation, globally and at
   the national level. Third, we summarize how the performance of RBOs can
   be evaluated in terms of coordination, accountability, legitimacy, and
   environmental effectiveness. Finally, we discuss the relationship
   between institutional design and performance. The main findings are: (1)
   the foundation of RBOs is not a neutral process but rather a highly
   political one, (2) the foundation of RBOs creates complex accountability
   relationships, and (3) institutional interplay, the capacity to generate
   financial resources, and a minimum degree of institutional stability are
   crucial to the successes of RBOs in realizing coordination and
   environmental effectiveness.},

Title = {Complexity, Modeling, and Natural Resource Management},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {This paper contends that natural resource management (NRM) issues are,
   by their very nature, complex and that both scientists and managers in
   this broad field will benefit from a theoretical understanding of
   complex systems. It starts off by presenting the core features of a view
   of complexity that not only deals with the limits to our understanding,
   but also points toward a responsible and motivating position. Everything
   we do involves explicit or implicit modeling, and as we can never have
   comprehensive access to any complex system, we need to be aware both of
   what we leave out as we model and of the implications of the choice of
   our modeling framework. One vantage point is never sufficient, as
   complexity necessarily implies that multiple (independent)
   conceptualizations are needed to engage the system adequately. We use
   two South African cases as examples of complex systems-restricting the
   case narratives mainly to the biophysical domain associated with NRM
   issues-that make the point that even the behavior of the biophysical
   subsystems themselves are already complex. From the insights into
   complex systems discussed in the first part of the paper and the lessons
   emerging from the way these cases have been dealt with in reality, we
   extract five interrelated generic principles for practicing science and
   management in complex NRM environments. These principles are then
   further elucidated using four further South African case
   studies-organized as two contrasting pairs-and now focusing on the more
   difficult organizational and social side, comparing the human
   organizational endeavors in managing such systems.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem services enhance well-being and the livelihoods of

   systems; however, their contributions to ecosystem services are rarely
   measured. We analysed the outcomes of civic ecology interventions
   undertaken in Durban, South Africa, as part of the Wise Wayz Water Care
   programme (the case study). Using mixed methods (household and
   beneficiary (community members implementing interventions) surveys,
   interviews, field observations, and workshops), we identified ecosystem
   service use and values, as well as the benefits of six interventions
   (solid waste management and removal from aquatic and terrestrial areas,
   recycling, invasive alien plant control, river water quality monitoring,
   vegetable production, and community engagement). Ecosystem services were
   widely used for agriculture, subsistence, and cultural uses. River water
   was used for crop irrigation, livestock, and recreation. Respondents
   noted numerous improvements to natural habitats: decrease in invasive
   alien plants, less pollution, improved condition of wetlands, and
   increased production of diverse vegetables. Improved habitats were
   linked to enhanced ecosystem services: clean water, agricultural
   production, harvesting of wood, and increased cultural and spiritual
   activities. Key social benefits were increased social cohesion,
   education, and new business opportunities. We highlight that local
   communities can leverage natural capital for well-being and encourage
   policy support of civic ecology initiatives.},

Title = {Evolution of the societal value of water resources for economic
   development versus environmental sustainability in Australia from 1843
   to 2011},

Abstract = {Societal values are generally seen as leading to changes in human
   decisions and behavior, but have not been addressed adequately in
   current water management, which is blind to changes in the social
   drivers for, or societal responses to, management decisions. This paper
   describes the evolution of the societal value of water resources in
   Australia over a period of 169 years. These values were classified into
   two groups: those supporting economic development versus those
   supporting environmental sustainability. The Sydney Morning Herald
   newspaper was used as the main data source to track the changes in the
   societal value of water resources. Content analysis was used to create a
   description of the evolution of these societal values. Mathematical
   regression analysis, in combination of transition theory, was used to
   determine the stages of transition of the societal value, and the
   co-evolved social-ecological framework was used to explain how the
   evolution of societal values interacted with water management policies
   and practices, and droughts. Key findings included that the transition
   of the societal value of water resources fitted the sigmoid curve - a
   conceptual S curve for the transition of social systems. Also, the
   transition of the societal value of water resources in Australia went
   through three stages: (1) pre-development (1900s-1962), when the
   societal value of water resources was dominated by economic development;
   (2) take-off (1963-1980), when the societal value of water resources
   reflected the increasing awareness of the environment due to the
   outbreak of pollution events; (3) acceleration (1981-2011), when the
   environment-oriented societal value of water resources combined with the
   Millennium Drought to trigger a package of policy initiatives and
   management practices focused on sustainable water resource use. The
   approach developed in this study, provides a roadmap for the development
   of new disciplines across social and natural science. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {Thresholds of hydrologic flow regime of a river and investigation of
   climate change impact-the case of the Lower Brahmaputra river Basin},
Journal = {CLIMATIC CHANGE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {120},
Number = {1-2},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The sustainability of social-ecological systems depends on river flows
   being maintained within a range to which those systems are adapted. In
   order to determine the extent of this natural range of variation, we
   assess ecological flow thresholds and the occurrence of potentially
   damaging flood events to society in the context of the Lower Brahmaputra
   river basin. The ecological flow threshold was calculated using
   twenty-two `Range of Variability (RVA)' parameters, considering the
   range between +/- 1 standard deviation from the mean of the natural
   flow. Damaging flood events were calculated using flood frequency
   analysis of Annual Maxima series and using the flood classification of
   Bangladesh. The climate change impacts on future river flow were
   calculated by using a weighted ensemble analysis of twelve global
   circulation models (GCMs) outputs driving a large-scale hydrologic
   model. The simulated climate change induced altered flow regime of the
   Lower Brahmaputra River Basin was then investigated and compared with
   the calculated threshold flows. The results demonstrate that various
   parameters including the monthly mean of low flow (January, February and
   March) and high flow (June, July and August) periods, the 7-day average
   minimum flow, and the yearly maximum flow will exceed the threshold
   conditions by 1956-1995 under the business-as-usual A1B and A2 future
   scenarios. The results have a number of policy level implications for
   government agencies of the Lower Brahmaputra River Basin, specifically
   for Bangladesh. The calculated thresholds may be used as a good basis
   for negotiations with other riparian countries of the basin. The
   methodological approach presented in this study can be applied to other
   river basins and provide a useful basis for transboundary water
   resources management.},

Title = {Opportunities and challenges for water-dependent protected area
   management arising from water management reform in the Murray-Darling
   Basin: a case study from the Macquarie Marshes in Australia},
Journal = {AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2016},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {1. In dryland environments, freshwater ecosystems often suffer extensive
   degradation through habitat modification and water regime changes. The
   Macquarie Marshes are located in the Murray-Darling Basin in
   south-eastern Australia. They are an example of an ecosystem that has
   experienced significant degradation in recent decades owing to upstream
   water diversions. Recent reforms of water management in the
   Murray-Darling Basin have attempted to balance environmental needs
   against consumptive uses of water.
   2. This paper examines the role a protected area has played in
   conserving the Macquarie Marshes freshwater ecosystem and discusses how
   Murray-Darling Basin water reform, together with social expectations of
   public land managers, have had impacts on the management of the
   Macquarie Marshes Nature Reserve.
   3. Protected areas may limit adverse impacts on habitat associated with
   local-scale agricultural production but struggle without formal water
   management arrangements to protect water-dependent ecosystems from
   threats operating at a catchment scale. Protected area managers balance
   demands from stakeholders to address local issues, such as fire
   management and geomorphic changes, against contributing to the
   achievement of environmental goals in a water planning system that
   operates at the catchment scale.
   4. European settlement and water resource development has marginalized
   local Aboriginal people from any role in land and water management
   activities. The water reforms have given them more opportunities for
   involvement in decision-making processes, but opportunities for
   increased access to water for cultural and spiritual purposes remain
   limited. Protected areas offer a means of providing greater access for
   Aboriginal people to their ancestral lands.
   5. The strategies and processes developed to maintain and enhance the
   Macquarie Marshes exemplify the evolution in understanding of freshwater
   ecosystem protection in Australia, and are relevant globally to water
   resource management in complex social-ecological systems. Copyright (C)

Title = {Institutional Performance of Collective Irrigation Systems: A Fuzzy Set
   Qualitative Comparative Analysis in the Nile Delta of Egypt},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Egypt, akin to many countries in the global South, has striven to
   promote collective management to overcome the challenges of irrigation
   management since the 1990s. Establishing shared pumping stations (SPSs)
   has been one of the cornerstones helping farmers better manage water for
   irrigation. Operating SPSs successfully poses collective action
   problems, for which there is no single set of solutions. This paper
   utilizes fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to identify
   which conditions or configurations are sufficient or necessary for
   well-operated SPSs. The study draws on empirical data gathered through
   semi-structured interviews from 45 cases, located in Kafr El-Sheikh
   Governorate in Egypt's Nile Delta. Results show that three different
   paths are sufficient to ensure well-operated SPSs. These are: (1) the
   condition of effective rules related to allocation, monitoring, and
   sanctions; (2) the configuration of small group size of SPSs and large
   irrigated sizes of SPSs; or (3) the configuration of adequate water
   supply and appropriate location of the SPS command area. The paper
   concludes that neither group size nor resource size alone explains the
   outcome of collective action, while a combination of both factors does.
   Similarly, an adequate water supply is essential to enhance users'
   engagement in collective actions only when resource location
   characteristics do not provide alternative water sources for irrigation.},

Title = {Freshwater Ecosystem Services in Mining Regions: Modelling Options for
   Policy Development Support},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The ecosystem services (ES) approach offers an integrated perspective of
   social-ecological systems, suitable for holistic assessments of mining
   impacts. Yet for ES models to be policy-relevant, methodological
   consensus in mining contexts is needed. We review articles assessing ES
   in mining areas focusing on freshwater components and policy support
   potential. Twenty-six articles were analysed concerning (i)
   methodological complexity (data types, number of parameters, processes
   and ecosystem-human integration level) and (ii) potential applicability
   for policy development (communication of uncertainties, scenario
   simulation, stakeholder participation and management recommendations).
   Articles illustrate mining impacts on ES through valuation exercises
   mostly. However, the lack of ground-and surface-water measurements, as
   well as insufficient representation of the connectivity among soil,
   water and humans, leave room for improvements. Inclusion of
   mining-specific environmental stressors models, increasing resolution of
   topographies, determination of baseline ES patterns and inclusion of
   multi-stakeholder perspectives are advantageous for policy support. We
   argue that achieving more holistic assessments exhorts practitioners to
   aim for high social-ecological connectivity using mechanistic models
   where possible and using inductive methods only where necessary. Due to
   data constraints, cause-effect networks might be the most feasible and
   best solution. Thus, a policy-oriented framework is proposed, in which
   data science is directed to environmental modelling for analysis of
   mining impacts on water ES.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {39},
Pages = {145-155},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Row crop production in the United States (US) Midwest is responsible for
   a myriad of water pollution issues in the Mississippi River Basin and
   the Gulf of Mexico. US federal and state governments have spent billions
   of dollars since the 1930's to understand and develop biological and
   geophysical practices that will reduce the negative impacts of
   agriculture on these landscapes and water bodies. However, significantly
   fewer resources have been applied to understanding the human factor
   within this social-ecological system. Recently the social psychological
   framework known as farmer identity as been used to better understand how
   farmers view themselves as they perform their role as farmer. To
   empirically test this concept in the US state of Iowa, a farmer identity
   question was developed and data were collected as part of an annual
   survey of Iowa farmers. Four farmer identities (Productivist,
   Conservationist, Civic-minded, and Naturalist) are identified using
   principal components analysis and tested for their ability to predict
   support for farm policy scenarios related to soil and water resource
   protection. Results show that Productivist, Conservationist, and
   Naturalist identities were likely to be activated by soil and water
   policies; and the Civic-minded identity was not activated by soil and
   water policies in general but was significantly against more money for
   conservation because it might mean more regulation. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {In the Anthropocene, human activities have created unprecedented changes
   and nonlinear relationships between humans and nature. These changes can
   be much faster and more intense in arid and semiarid areas that have
   been affected by intense human activities. Iran has climates from very
   humid to very dry, but arid and semiarid climates cover the country's
   largest area. Many of these arid areas have undergone severe changes in
   their surface and groundwater ecosystems in recent years, which have
   caused severe damage to humans and the environment in the area and
   surrounding areas. Therefore, in this study, using the theory of regime
   shifts, the time series of the Zayandeh-Rud River Basin in the center of
   Iran were analyzed. First, the data of the desired time series in the
   period of 1986-2018 was arranged seasonally. Then, using the sequential
   t-test method, regime shifts in these time series were identified, and
   then, causal loop diagrams of these shifts and their drivers and
   feedbacks were interpreted. The results showed that in the time series
   of quantity and quality of surface water and groundwater level in the
   studied stations and aquifers, regime shifts can be identified. Regime
   shifts were also identified in the time series of agricultural land
   area. These shifts have occurred with the increase in human activities
   since the early 1950s in the metropolis of Isfahan, the increase in
   agricultural and industrial exploitation, and consequently, the increase
   in population. When this reinforcing feedback loop becomes dominant, the
   Zayandeh-Rud River system has shifted from a regime of rich water
   resources to a regime of poor water resources. However, by recognizing
   and systematically analyzing these shifts, the Zayandeh-Rud River system
   can be directed toward a sustainable system through structural reform,
   negotiation, and redefining goals.},

Title = {Applying the Concept of Fit to Water Governance Reforms in South Africa},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The call for a spatial fit between institutional arrangements and the
   resource they manage is reflected in such water management paradigms as
   river basin management and in a number of international agreements (e.
   g., the European Union Water Framework Directive). Consequently, a
   number of countries are currently introducing river basin management,
   which, besides management along hydrological boundaries, has recently
   come to include such aspects of governance as stakeholder participation
   and policy integration. Beginning with a discussion of the goals and
   limitations of river basin management, this paper describes how the
   concept has been implemented in South Africa-a country that has been
   lauded for its state-of-the-art water legislation, but whose water
   administration is currently struggling to implement it. The example
   begins by showing the limitations of focusing on the dimension of
   spatial fit: a perfect spatial fit in basin management is almost
   impossible owing to the nature of the resource and to social and
   economic requirements. There are trade-offs between the identification
   of hydrological boundaries (which sometimes proves difficult) and
   ``boundaries{''} of social organization, such as a feasible size for
   effective management, meaningful stakeholder participation, and
   financial viability. Furthermore, the improved spatial fit of the
   institutional arrangement and water resource boundaries causes problems
   of interplay by increasing the need for coordination and cooperation
   among water management organizations at different levels and on
   different scales. The example then considers the relevance of other
   dimensions of water management. It shows that, besides the focus on
   spatial fit, there is a need to recognize major defining features or
   boundaries to the problem other than hydrological boundaries, such as
   those imposed by water service infrastructure (functional fit) and
   impacts of climate change (dynamic fit), and a need to acknowledge the
   political and economic dimensions of water management.},

Title = {Analysis of social-ecological dynamics driving conflict in linked
   surface-groundwater systems},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Conflict over water resources emerges from complex interactions among
   biophysical, social, and economic processes operating at multiple
   scales. Competing use of linked surface-groundwater (LSGW) resources is
   an excellent yet relatively unexplored example of such conflict. Dynamic
   circumstances surrounding the contested installation of a high capacity
   municipal well in southeastern Wisconsin were examined through the
   theoretical lens of adaptive governance using document analysis and
   open-ended key stakeholder interviews. A framework analysis method
   extracted 16 controlling variables from the qualitative data. These
   controlling variables were placed on a threshold matrix at their
   appropriate geospatial scale (Property, Watershed, State) and process
   domain (Biophysical, Economic, Social), which revealed several
   social-ecological feedbacks not currently addressed by management
   authorities. Three dynamic feedback loops were identified that explain
   the emergence and resolution of LSGW conflict in the case study area.
   Conflict emerged when processes driving new development in southeastern
   Wisconsin threatened to impact a highly valued groundwater dependent
   lake. Lake groups engaged in collective learning, utilized information
   networks, and displayed leadership to address the issue. However, lack
   of participatory avenues for dispute resolution at the scale of
   occurrence drove lake groups to challenge the regulatory authority of
   the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR). Through
   order-based legitimacy, legal resolution affected governance of LSGW
   resources across the state, but did little to address the underlying
   stakeholder values driving conflict. We conclude this system will
   continue to be subjected to ``legal back and forth,{''} recurrent
   conflict, and uncertainty for both environmental and developmental
   interests until a more participatory process is developed with
   regulatory authorities to resolve conflicts over LSGW.},

Title = {Entanglements of agrobiodiversity-food amid cascading migration, coca
   conflicts, and water development (Bolivia, 1990-2013)},
Journal = {GEOFORUM},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {128},

Abstract = {This study examines agrobiodiversity production and consumption among
   indigenous people and smallholders engaged with cascading migration,
   coca, and water resource changes. Addressing the questions if and how
   agrobiodiversity is viable amid intensifying extra-local influences, it
   combines the theorization of a pathway that has emerged via
   infrastructure entanglements and the extended case study of local
   utilization practices. The theoretical orientation integrates key
   elements of political ecology and social-ecological systems. We
   undertook surveys, interviews, and ethnographic participant observation
   in 10 communities and villages of Cochabamba, Bolivia, between 1990 and
   2013. Results show how agrobiodiversity was utilized at moderate-high
   levels in the land and water systems, foods, and other uses of
   indigenous peasants and smallholder farmers in the 1990-2013 period even
   as certain minor crops were significantly reduced. Moreover, the results
   reveal how agrobiodiversity and agrobiodiverse foods have functioned in
   production and consumption amid the infrastructure entanglements of
   migration, roads, and irrigation. Embeddedness as both quotidian
   resource capacities and contingent sociocultural symbols was hinged to
   agrarian change in these accelerated entanglements. Mobilities of both
   meaning and people in recent infrastructure entanglement is
   characteristic of the unfolding utilization of agrobiodiversity and
   agrobiodiverse foods. Social power in the complex contours of
   accelerated entanglement have furnished meanings ranging from the
   resistance politics of indigenous people and smallholders to the
   purposeful agendas of more powerful groups. The conclusion highlights
   how dynamic agrobiodiversity utilization has emerged via the pathway of
   indigenous people and smallholders who are engaged in cascading,
   extra-local entanglements.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {``Action situations{''}-events, venues, or physically interdependent
   instances of decision-making-have become a central unit of analysis in
   the social-environmental sciences, particularly among scholars
   interested in bridging the social with the biophysical or ecological
   side of interdependent decisions. A growing body of empirical studies in
   social-ecological systems research has recently used case and
   comparative studies to analyse multiple interdependent action
   situations, structured into networks. In this article, we take stock of
   this body of empirical research, synthesize the diverse approaches that
   scholars have taken to assess ``networks of action situations{''}, and
   identify fruitful paths forward. We conduct a systematic review of the
   empirical literature in the field, reviewing and summarizing the key
   characteristics of the empirical studies, including network features,
   topologies, methods, and data sources used in each case. We summarize
   and discuss the conceptualizations, methods, diagnostic procedures, and
   conclusions used in this body of work in a narrative framework
   synthesis. The review indicates that an increasingly coherent approach
   is taking shape, but a systematic, protocol-driven, or formalized
   approach is only partly emerging. We derive future research needs that
   could help accumulate knowledge from empirical research.},

Title = {Farmers' livelihood adaptation to environmental change in an arid

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {411-423},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Adaption to global environmental change is a focus of sustainability
   research. Farmers face multiple environmental and social pressures due
   to global environmental change. Effective livelihood changes must be
   taken to decrease asset losses and to adapt to current or future
   environmental challenges. However, there are few studies that
   systematically understand and assess farmers' livelihood adaptation. We
   developed an integrated analytical framework for livelihood adaptation
   and explored the relationships between adaptive capacity, adaptation
   outcomes, and farmers' adaptation strategies. We applied this framework
   to a case study of the Minqin Oasis in China and assessed the livelihood
   adaptation of farmers facing environmental change and water scarcity.
   Household surveys and semi-structured interviews were used for data
   collection. We found that (1) farmers' livelihood adaptation choices
   were limited due to current govemment policies and their own resources
   and (2) livelihood adaptive capacity (such as land, water resources, and
   social networks) and policy reform (water resource fees, and cultivated
   land compression) had a key impact on farmers' adaptation. The factors
   representing a poor livelihood strategy and adaptation outcomes of the
   farmer include the following: (1) a low level of livelihood awareness
   among farmers (such as passive fanners), (2) a lack of livelihood
   assets, (3) government focus on environmental recovery, and (4) a
   weakened role of the market. To improve the adaptation of farmers'
   livelihoods to environmental change, these measures must balance the
   relationship between environmental restoration and farmers' livelihoods,
   consider a variety of key forces, and guide farmers to adopt effective
   strategies. This study facilitates the development of livelihood
   adaptation analysis methods for global change studies. Case-based
   research results can be used to improve local decision-making and can
   provide an assessment reference method for farmer adaptation to regional
   and global environmental change.},

Abstract = {A sustainable supply of ecosystem services (ESs) is key to achieving
   sustainable development goals (SDGs). The ESs concept is based on
   socio-ecological complexity integrated with local decision demands. It
   helps prevent both regional ecological degradation and conflicts
   associated with large-scale land-use/coverage-change (LUCC). In this
   study, an integrated assessment method was developed to analyze
   spatiotemporal changes in the supply capacities of ESs and assess their
   implications on the SDGs. Therefore, land-system dynamics in Gansu
   Province, northwest China were elucidated based on LUCC maps (1992-2015)
   using several assessment tools. The LUCC analysis indicated rapid
   expansion of grassland and cultivated land in Gannan and Qingyang
   cities, respectively, which was attributed to conversion of forests and
   bare land. The supply capacity of ESs indicated a monotonous increasing
   trend (cultural service > supporting service > provisioning service >
   regulating service) which was associated with positive changes in
   multiple ESs. However, the decrease in specific services likely caused
   unexpected losses which potentially offset profits from the current
   management of the socio-ecological system. Frequency of linkages with
   the SDGs indicated the following order: regulating service >
   provisioning service > cultural service > supporting service. Further,
   flood prevention, carbon sequestration, and nutrient retention were the
   most frequent ESs. Additionally, the top 25\% frequency of occurrence of
   ESs that occurred in SDGs comprised SDG15 (40), SDG11 (18), and SDG2
   (17), indicating that key policy implications in Gansu province should
   emphasize sustainable management of forest ecosystems, cities, and
   cropping systems under limited water resources. Therefore, this study
   provides an integrated assessment of the effects of changing land-system
   dynamics on the potential provision of ESs and their subsequent impacts
   on the SDGs in typical semi-arid and arid regions.},

Title = {A systems thinking approach for eliciting mental models from visual
   boundary objects in hydropolitical contexts: a case study from the
   Pilcomayo River Basin},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Transboundary collaborations related to international freshwater are
   critical for ensuring equitable, efficient, and sustainable shared
   access to our planet's most fundamental resources. Visual artifacts,
   such as knowledge maps, functioning as boundary objects, are used in
   hydropolitical contexts to convey understandings and facilitate
   discussion across scales about challenges and opportunities from
   multiple perspectives. Such focal points for discussion are valuable in
   creating shared, socially negotiated priorities and integrating diverse
   and often disparate cultural perspectives that naturally exist in the
   context of international transboundary water resources. Visual boundary
   objects can also represent the collective mental models of the actor
   countries and transboundary institutions and encompass their
   perspectives on the complex hydro-social cycles within specific
   ``problem-shed{''} regions of the shared resources. To investigate and
   synthesize these multiple concepts, we developed a novel method of
   eliciting mental models from visual boundary objects in
   social-ecological contexts by combining content analysis with
   theoretical frameworks for boundary objects and systems thinking Using
   this method, we analyzed visual boundary objects represented in publicly
   available documents formally related to decision making in the Pilcomayo
   River Basin in South America. The Pilcomayo River Basin is a unique case
   for investigating decision making in international collaboration among
   represented states, given the unique social and biophysical challenges
   that have plagued the region for over a century. Using our framework, we
   were able to develop insight into the collective mental models of
   stakeholders, organizations, and decision-making institutions, related
   to priorities, vulnerabilities, and adaptation strategies among the
   various socioeconomic, cultural, political, and biophysical drivers for
   different regions and scales of the basin.},

Abstract = {In this paper we will present a case study in Iran which explains the
   reasons for inaction by a society that is highly dependent on rapidly
   depleting groundwater resources. To obtain a better understanding of
   social inaction when faced with groundwater depletion, we investigated
   the changing role of society in groundwater systems and the movement
   away from collective action. A qualitative inquiry was used in this
   study, based mainly on an analysis of multiple interviews conducted with
   groundwater users, complemented by documentary analysis. Results are
   presented in different sections. First, a brief description of
   groundwater management in Rafsanjan is presented as typical of
   groundwater management in Iran. Then we present the chronology of the
   emergence of chaos in groundwater management in Rafsanjan. Finally, we
   provide the water users' dominant frame of reference for the resolution
   of the critical water resource situation. Results indicate that the two
   main factors contributing to changes in groundwater drawdown are
   technological transitions and national policy reforms. However, findings
   suggest that the incorporation of factors related to political ecology -
   such as power relations, equity, and corruption - are important elements
   to consider in relation to the collective self-regulation of groundwater
   social-ecological systems. This paper does not provide a feasibility
   study for implementing a specific model of community-based management in
   Rafsanjan Plain, neither does it present an action plan towards
   self-regulation. It does, however, provide a more realistic viewpoint on
   the potential for pursuing a community-based management approach by
   helping to identify key challenges that would have to be considered.},

Abstract = {This study takes an historical approach in order to establish how the
   form and function of the social-ecological system that represents the
   Bangladesh south-western coastal zone has changed over recent decades.
   Time series data for a range of ecosystem services and drivers are
   analysed to define the range of trends, the presence of change points,
   slow and fast variables and the significant drivers of change. Since the
   1980s, increasing gross domestic product and per capita income mirror
   rising levels of food and inland fish production. As a result, the size
   of population below the poverty line has reduced by similar to 17 \%. In
   contrast, non-food ecosystem services such as water availability, water
   quality and land stability have deteriorated. Conversion of rice fields
   to shrimp farms is almost certainly a factor in increasing soil and
   surface water salinity. Most of the services experienced statistically
   significant change points between 1975 and 1980, and among the services,
   water availability, shrimp farming and maintenance of biodiversity
   appear to have passed tipping points. An environmental Kuznets curve
   analysis suggests that the point at which growing economic wealth feeds
   back into effective environmental protection has not yet been reached
   for water resources. Trends in indicators of ecosystem services and
   human well-being point to widespread non-stationary dynamics governed by
   slowly changing variables with an increased likelihood of systemic
   threshold changes/tipping points in the near future. The results will
   feed into simulation models and strategies that can define alternative
   and sustainable paths for land management.},

Title = {Impact of hydropower development on rural livelihood: An agent-based
   exploration},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {275},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Decisions on capital intensive hydrological infrastructure, including
   dams and canal-fed irrigation schemes, may have non-trivial effects on
   the behaviour and, ultimately, the well-being of local communities. We
   propose an interdisciplinary agent-based model to deepen the
   understanding of the impact of hydropower infrastructure investment on
   the water-energy-food nexus of local rural communities, focusing on food
   security in the context of a moderately sized hydropower and irrigation
   development in a developing country. The paper explicitly formalises the
   decision processes and the interactions between rural villages,
   districts and national governments in hierarchical and peer-to-peer
   networks. The findings capture the consequences of the arising
   competition for water and land between new dam construction and local
   agricultural production. Results demonstrate that these dynamics can be
   further exacerbated by demographic pressures and climate change, leading
   to unsustainable consumption levels. However, these effects could be
   mitigated by prevention-oriented governmental policies such as
   investments in best practices and technological innovation, or by
   updating diet preferences, such increasing the consumption of food
   commodities with more efficient production. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Social-ecological interactions in the Draa River Basin, southern
   Morocco: Towards nature conservation and human well-being using the
   IPBES framework},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {769},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Water is essential to human societies and a prerequisite for flourishing
   nature, especially in arid regions. Yet, climate change and
   socio-economic developments are expected to exacerbate current and
   future stresses on water resources, demanding innovative approaches to
   balance water needs for society and nature conservation.
   In this study, we use the IPBES conceptual framework to combine
   ecological and socio-economic insights and analyse the connections
   between people and nature in the water scarce Draa River Basin, southern
   Morocco. We study the diversity of desert benthic macroinvertebrates as
   one component of nature using DNA barcoding and their potential to serve
   as bioindicators of human impact by relating species occurrences to
   environmental parameters. Furthermore, based on 87 interviews with
   farmers and key institutional stakeholders, we investigate how farmers
   perceive water related changes and how water is managed in the basin.
   Regarding benthic macroinvertebrates, 41 families were identified, 475
   DNA barcodes generated and assigned to 118 putative species (Barcode
   Index Numbers) of which 60 were first records. This indicates a lack of
   reference sequences for known, but also a potentially high number of
   undescribed species. Environmental parameters, which are partly
   influenced by human activities, such as aquatic stages, salinity and
   intermittency, were the most important variables explaining invertebrate
   richness and community composition in generalized linear models. We
   further describe farmers perceptions of decreasing water quality and
   quantity. Farmers generally believe that they are able to cope with
   water related changes, although perceptions are regionally
   differentiated with farmers downstream being less optimistic. With
   growing concerns, water policies currently locus on increasing water
   supply and less on reducing water demands.
   Based on these findings, the usefulness of the IPBES framework for
   understanding social-ecological system dynamics is reflected, and
   recommendations for future freshwater management and research are
   derived. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The impact of adaptive management on community resilience in arid rural
   areas facing environmental change: An integrated analytical framework},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {150},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Environmental variability poses a major risk to rural communities and
   farmers, particularly in dryland regions. Effective adaptive strategies
   must be implemented to promote the transformation, adaptation, and
   sustainable development of rural areas located in arid regions
   worldwide. The adaptive management of rural transformation can influence
   community resilience by changing the elemental structures of
   social-ecological systems. However, few studies have reported an
   assessment framework between system resilience and adaptive management.
   We developed an integrated analytical framework to fully estimate the
   impact of adaptation strategy implementation on different levels of
   community resilience, considering the differences between spatial
   geographic units and measuring changes in different temporal scales. We
   applied this framework to a case study of China's Minqin Oasis,
   assessing the community resilience of rural areas facing environmental
   change. We found that (1) rural community resilience in Minqin Oasis has
   obvious spatial and temporal evolution characteristics, with the overall
   rural community resilience showing a decreasing trend over the past 30
   years, while the spatial distribution of community resilience tended to
   be balanced for the period 2011-2017; (2) the main obstacles to the
   improvement of rural community resilience include wind and sand control,
   ecological water resources, economic levels, and the adjustment of the
   agricultural economic structure; and (3) Adaptation strategies based on
   the priority of ecological restoration and government-led mandatory
   policy are not conducive to the improvement of community resilience.
   This study provides a clear framework for linking adaptive management
   and community resilience assessment in the context of climate change or
   environmental risk. It also offers an effective means for policymakers
   to direct strategic resources to the geographic spaces where they are
   most required. Case-based research results provide an evaluation
   reference for the adaptive management of arid rural areas in the face of
   environmental change worldwide.},

Title = {Profiling resilience and adaptation in mega deltas: A comparative
   assessment of the Mekong, Yellow, Yangtze, and Rhine deltas},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {198},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {River deltas and estuaries are disproportionally-significant coastal
   landforms that are inhabited by nearly 600 M people globally. In recent
   history, rapid socio-economic development has dramatically changed many
   of the World's mega deltas, which have typically undergone agricultural
   intensification and expansion, land-use change, urbanization, water
   resources engineering and exploitation of natural resources. As a
   result, mega deltas have evolved into complex and potentially vulnerable
   socio-ecological systems with unique threats and coping capabilities.
   The goal of this research was to establish a holistic understanding of
   threats, resilience, and adaptation for four mega deltas of variable
   geography and levels of socio-economic development, namely the Mekong,
   Yellow River, Yangtze, and Rhine deltas. Compiling this kind of
   information is critical for managing and developing these complex
   coastal areas sustainably but is typically hindered by a lack of
   consistent quantitative data across the ecological, social and economic
   sectors. To overcome this limitation, we adopted a qualitative approach,
   where delta characteristics across all sectors were assessed through
   systematic expert surveys. This approach enabled us to generate a
   comparative assessment of threats, resilience, and
   resilience-strengthening adaptation across the four deltas. Our
   assessment provides novel insights into the various components that
   dominate the overall risk situation in each delta and, for the first
   time, illustrates how each of these components differ across the four
   mega deltas. As such, our findings can guide a more detailed, sector
   specific, risk assessment or assist in better targeting the
   implementation of risk mitigation and adaptation strategies.},

Title = {Socio-Hydrological Approach for Water Resource Management and Human
   Well-Being in Pinglin District, Taiwan},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Despite being a limited resource, pollution, poor management, and other
   drivers like climate change make available water unsuitable and
   insufficient for human consumption and ecosystem maintenance. Therefore,
   a transdisciplinary approach is needed for managing this precious
   resource. The overall aim of this paper is to address water inequalities
   and improve human well-being using an integrated approach of key
   informant interviews, hydrological modeling, and the payment of
   ecosystem services (PES) scheme in Pinglin District, Taiwan. This site
   is an upstream area of Feicui Reservoir, which protects the downstream
   tap water supply. Key informant interviews were conducted to identify
   the gaps in and challenges to water resource management. This was
   followed by a scenario-based hydrological simulation using a Water
   Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) tool to project future water quality by
   the year 2050 (using biochemical oxygen demand and total coliform
   content as key indicator parameters) and to trace the factors
   responsible for water pollution. Survey analysis of key informant
   interviews depicts that this area is facing several challenges, such as
   lack of water infrastructure, agricultural subsidy, construction
   restrictions, etc., which cumulatively cause water scarcity in the
   upstream regions. On the other hand, hydrological simulation results
   show that population decline and climate change under an RCP 8.5
   scenario will have an enormous negative impact on water quality. The
   concentrations of BOD and E. coli in river water will expand by 110.1\%
   and 117.3\%, respectively, by 2050 compared to 2018. Finally, the
   results of the study suggest that the PES scheme can play a positive
   role in enabling integrated water resource management. For example
   construction of a small-scale wastewater treatment plant in the upstream
   area will reduce the total E. coli concentration by up to 90\%. While
   the initial cost of construction will be taken care of by the
   government, the operation and management cost of this infrastructure
   will be covered by people living downstream, who need to pay only \$0.10
   per year per person. The obtained results should be vital for both the
   stakeholders and decision-makers in this region.},

Title = {Flexible water allocations and rotational delivery combined adapt
   irrigation systems to drought},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Self-governing irrigation systems are integral to global food security
   and face serious problems under climate change. This is particularly
   true in areas expected to become more arid such as the Southwestern
   United States, where restrictive water rights are strictly enforced.
   Adaptations to these dual climatic and legal challenges include
   user-selected rules. In particular, during water shortage self-governing
   irrigation systems often change water allocations between members and
   rotate water delivery. However, it is unclear how these rules interact
   with each other as configurations and with contextual factors, such as
   the degree of water scarcity. It is also unclear how these rules
   influence outcomes between irrigators closer to the water source and
   those farther from it. How might different configurations of rules
   interact with water availability to produce outcomes along an irrigation
   system's canal network? This study addresses this question by exploiting
   a natural experiment in water distribution and allocation rules during
   shortage among a stratified sample of 60 snowmelt dependent irrigation
   systems in the San Luis Valley of Colorado during a four-year drought
   period from 2011-2014. A key finding is that the combination of
   rotational delivery and flexible water allocations produces the most
   equal crop growth between irrigators at the head and tail of the
   irrigation system at all levels of water availability. The marginal
   productivity of water at the head and tail end of irrigation systems at
   all levels of water availability is also equalized under this
   configuration. These results suggest a greater likelihood of ongoing
   collective action, important for climate change adaptation. However,
   rotation with flexible allocations is outperformed by other
   configurations depending on context. These findings highlight the
   configurational relationships between rules, further illustrate
   interactions between rules and physical context, and caution against
   panaceas in water resource management and climate change adaptation.},

Title = {Water, resilience and the law: From general concepts and governance
   design principles to actionable mechanisms},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {43},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {98-110},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Climate change has significant ramifications for water law and
   governance, yet, there is strong evidence that legal regulations have
   often failed to protect environments or promote sustainable development.
   Scholars have increasingly suggested that the preservation and
   restoration paradigms of legislation and regulation are no longer
   adequate for climate change related challenges in complex and
   cross-scale social-ecological systems. This is namely due to past
   assumptions of stationarity, uniformitarianism and the perception of
   ecosystem change as predictable and reversible. This paper reviews the
   literature on law and resilience and then presents and discusses a set
   of practical examples of legal mechanisms from the water resources
   management sector, identified according to a set of guiding principles
   from the literature on adaptive capacity, adaptive governance as well as
   adaptive and integrated water resources management. It then assesses the
   aptness of these different measures according to scientific evidence of
   increased uncertainty and changing ecological baselines. A review of the
   best practice examples demonstrates that there are a number of best
   practice examples attempting to integrate adaptive elements of
   flexibility, iterativity, connectivity and subsidiarity into a variety
   of legislative mechanisms, suggesting that there is not as significant a
   tension between resilience and the law as many scholars have suggested.
   However, while many of the mechanisms may indeed be suitable for
   addressing challenges relating to current levels of change and
   uncertainty, analysis across a broader range of uncertainty highlights
   challenges relating to more irreversible changes associated with greater
   levels of warming. Furthermore the paper identifies a set of
   pre-requisites that are fundamental to the successful implementation of
   such mechanisms, namely monitoring and data sharing, financial and
   technical capacity, particularly in nations that are most at risk with
   the least data infrastructure. The article aims to contribute to both
   theory and practice, enabling policy makers to translate resilience
   based terminology and adaptive governance principles into clear
   instructions for incorporating uncertainty into legislation and policy
   design. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   systems or forestry traditionally uses case studies providing us with a
   rich, in-depth perspective on many single systems. This comes with a
   disadvantage - lacking comparability as differences between studies
   exist in variables examined, their operationalization or methods used.
   Thus, studies often disagree on important drivers for ecological
   success. However, due to design differences the reasons behind different
   results often remain unknown. One reason might be the impact of method
   choice. Hence, this article tests the influence of methods on model
   results. We use a high-quality data set, the Nepal Irrigation
   Institutions and Systems database (NIIS), developed at the Ostrom
   Workshop. It contains 263 cases, each record having information on
   around 600 variables. Multiple machine learning methods - random forests
   (RF), gradient boosting (GBM), shallow neural networks (SNN) and deep
   neural networks (DNN) - are compared with a standard statistical
   approach (multivariate linear regressions (MLR)). We try to answer the
   question whether these methods differ in estimating the relevance for
   success of such well-known concepts like participation of users,
   resource size, relations with other groups, and social capital among
   others. The results indicate that both agreements and substantial
   differences exist across methods which casts doubt on the robustness of
   previous results. Hence, we advise more caution in interpreting existing
   results. We see this research as a step towards increasing the
   robustness of results and improving both generalisability and
   reproducibility of natural resource management research.},

Title = {Toward adaptive water governance: the role of systemic feedbacks for
   learning and adaptation in the eastern transboundary rivers of South
   Africa},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {This paper contributes to scholarship on adaptive water governance
   (AWG), following policy reforms in South Africa, through a focus on
   systemic feedbacks for learning and adaptation as critical aspects of
   AWG. We draw insights from three innovative and evolving water
   governance experiments. In 1998 South Africa adopted integrated water
   resources management (IWRM) as a transformative approach for achieving
   an equitable, sustainable, and decentralized stakeholder-centered water
   resources governance: all hallmarks of an enabling environment for a
   two-decade history of AWG, although not named as such. Progress in AWG
   is explored by using a longitudinal, evaluative exploration of three
   cases in two transboundary basins in South Africa, with a focus on the
   unfolding enabling environment for achieving sustainability and equity.
   Building on previous work, we present and discuss a range of enablers
   that are shown to function systemically to support feedbacks and build
   adaptive capacity and resilience in complex and uncertain river systems.
   In the Crocodile Basin, meta-governance arrangements that created an
   enabling space for collaborative experimentation and learning proved
   critical as feedbacks were progressively strengthened and embedded
   through evolving social and institutional arrangements. The enabling
   environment also supported a networked, blended system of
   stakeholder-and state-led platforms that have co-evolved through
   experimentation and learning. Despite progress, long-term persistence of
   action-learning feedbacks appears less certain in the Olifants Basin
   cases. We suggest that enabling meta-governance arrangements that offer
   an institutional home within which to embed learning is critical. The
   need to explore alternative networked governance arrangements and to
   explicitly manage for feedbacks that enhance learning at multiple scales
   is emphasized. We conclude with recommendations for future work on AWG,
   including reconciling differences between AWG and IWRM that originally
   framed South African reforms.},

Abstract = {Suspended infrastructure of megaprojects marks Latin American
   landscapes. However, little research has attended to the
   social-environmental and political-ecological processes of such
   infrastructure. Moreover, while social conflict often accompanies
   infrastructure development, our research emphasizes citizen contestation
   of the suspension and dynamic spatial unevenness as a claim on the state
   to complete the project. This study examines Colombia's largest
   suspended irrigation infrastructure, the Tolima Triangle Irrigation
   District, through a combined political ecology and social-ecological
   systems framework. Results of integrated analysis show how the
   suspension drives differentiation in resource use and the social
   responses of individuals and communities to deepening disparities. In
   turn, public contestation of suspended infrastructure drives future
   prospects for the Tolima megaproject. Data is drawn from field research
   conducted for one year in 2018-2019. Mixed methods included
   semi-structured interviews, environmental assessment techniques,
   household surveys, and ethnographic participant observation. The
   research demonstrates that suspended infrastructure is neither a
   politically neutral, merely passive backdrop nor void of transformation
   but rather is comprised of contested processes rooted in the expanding
   social-environmental and political-ecological unevenness of development.
   Our findings contribute to the research on infrastructure suspension and
   development, and they are set within a broader body of scholarship on
   irrigation and political ecology of Latin American countries.},

Title = {Balancing socioeconomic development with ecological conservation towards
   rural sustainability: a case study in semiarid rural China},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Despite the dramatic progress in poverty reduction, China's vast rural
   areas of backwardness, environmental degradation and low labour
   productivity are a long-standing challenge to achieve common prosperity
   and sustainable development. Finding a balance between ecological
   conservation and socioeconomic development is a solution. However,
   previous studies have largely neglected the concept. Here, we proposed a
   framework that integrates the ecological environment and socioeconomic
   wellbeing via farm management and the use of ecosystem services (ES) to
   assess rural sustainability and explore a suitable balance and pathways
   from the perspective of the human dimension. Taking Yan'he Township in
   China's Loess Plateau as an example, a clustering analysis was performed
   to group farm households based on their behaviour in cropping, land
   rental, and off-farm work. A composite index was built to assess rural
   sustainability at the farm household level, while a structural equation
   model was performed to estimate the effect of land-use practices on
   rural sustainability and explore adequate farm management and policy
   interventions. The results show that households with different farm
   management and land-use strategies had divergent agricultural
   performance, use of ES, and environmental and wellbeing outcomes.
   Increasing legume cropping with conservation approaches (e.g., rotation)
   and extended irrigation while encouraging migrant work with ensured
   equal urban-rural social welfare and property rights may contribute to
   balancing socioeconomic development with ecological conservation. The
   findings indicate that both interventionist policies and independent
   market support are vital for individual and community capacity building
   and public infrastructure development to stimulate agricultural
   adaptation and rural transformation towards sustainability.},

Title = {Sustaining the Commons: The Coercive to Cooperative, Resilient, and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {82},
Number = {4},
Pages = {327-349},
Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: States need guidance to adopt
   comprehensive water planning legislation that can affect urban planning
   and built form. Current state legislation, however, may not yet
   incorporate emerging water resource paradigms that promote sustainable
   water management at the state and substate levels. Planners can improve
   existing state legislation, but need guidance on incorporating the
   latest thinking on resilience, adaptive capacity, and sustainable
   commons management. I identify the 26 states with comprehensive water
   planning legislation, and analyze that legislation using a new
   assessment tool that builds on the coercive versus cooperative metric
   (CvCA). I determine where each state's water planning legislation falls
   on a coercive versus cooperative spectrum, and the extent to which each
   state's legislation incorporates sustainable commons management (SCM)
   and social-ecological resilience (SER) mechanisms and attributes. Most
   of the 26 states with comprehensive water planning legislation balance
   coercive and cooperative approaches to achieve state and substate water
   plans, although research suggests that planning is most effective when
   legislation is more cooperative. Moreover, most have not codified SCM
   and SER mechanisms into state water planning legislation, suggesting
   that the plans that follow may lack the adaptive capacity to increase
   the resilience of the water system. Research limitations include the
   single data source and potential interpretive coding bias.Takeaway for
   practice: Planners can advocate for new or improved state water
   legislation that incorporates integral adaptive and resiliency concepts,
   encouraging states to include the fundamental features of the
   social-ecological system that lead to better water management.},

Title = {Biocultural values of groundwater dependent ecosystems in Kona, Hawai'i},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) are increasingly recognized as
   important conservation targets with linked ecological and social value.
   However, the social uses and values of GDEs have received relatively
   little research attention in the peer-reviewed literature, precluding
   their greater inclusion in policy and management decisions. To help fill
   this gap, we provide a case study from Kona, Hawai'i, where multiple
   types of GDEs are abundant, to illustrate the diversity of social uses
   and values of GDEs. To explore these uses and values, we combined a
   literature review, archival analysis, and key-informant interviews with
   resource managers and lineal descendants connected to three prominent
   GDEs: Indigenous aquaculture systems, anchialine pools, and nearshore
   ecosystems. Interviews focused on current and historical uses and values
   of GDEs, contemporary management challenges and strategies, and desired
   visions for the future. Interviewees expressed a range of uses and
   values associated with GDEs, which we categorized using a Hawai'i-based
   cultural ecosystem service framework focused on social connections,
   physical and mental health, spirituality, and knowledge. Importantly,
   results suggest that the historical value of these systems directly
   informs current social value, and that restoration efforts are largely
   carried out through biocultural approaches, which emphasize the mutually
   reinforcing restoration of ecology and culture. We found that
   interviewees seek to restore ecosystem functions, cultural practice, and
   connection to place, and in some cases, local food production. Achieving
   these goals requires addressing multiple and interacting threats to
   these systems including invasive species, land-based sources of
   pollution, groundwater pumping, and climate change. Importantly,
   effective and equitable restoration also rests on recognition and
   amplification of Indigenous rights, knowledge, practice, and governance.
   These results provide important lessons for land and water management
   and policy in Hawai'i as well as other islands and coastal areas where
   GDEs have important linked social and ecological value.},

Title = {Evaluating the Management of a Tropical Reservoir: Implications of
   Climate Change for Water Availability},
Journal = {PACIFIC SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {74},
Number = {2},
Pages = {115-135},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Most tropical islands have limited water supply due to the small size of
   their watersheds and aquifers, unique geology, and distribution of
   rainfall; each affecting the reliability of water resources for meeting
   agricultural needs. To improve water supply, reservoirs provide critical
   storage of surface water. However, climate-driven shifts in the
   distribution, intensity, and amount of rainfall will alter runoff that
   feeds reservoirs. Mass-balance modeling was used to evaluate the effects
   of various management constraints on water availability for the Wahiawa
   Reservoir (O'ahu, Hawai'i) as well as the impact of 20\% less dry season
   rainfall and stream flow to assess the effect of projected climate
   change on maintaining: (1) a minimum downstream flow; (2) a minimum
   agricultural supply; (3) a minimum and maximum reservoir level; and (4)
   a combination of minimum downstream flow and minimum agricultural
   supply. Under current climate conditions, maintaining a minimal
   downstream water release could be met with minimal consequences for
   agricultural supply and reservoir level. However, both agricultural
   supply and downstream flow had to be reduced during dry periods to keep
   the reservoir level above a minimum level. Maintaining a minimum
   downstream flow resulted in a 4.2\% reduction in mean agricultural
   supply and 2.2 \% reduction in mean reservoir elevation compared to
   baseline conditions. By contrast, a 20\% reduction in dry season water
   inputs resulted in a 17.8\% reduction in mean agricultural supply in the
   minimum downstream flow scenario compared to current rainfall
   conditions. Furthermore, the number of days the reservoir level dropped
   below the minimum needed for a fishery increased (range 1.15-25x) across
   scenarios compared to baseline. Successful management of surface water
   within a social-ecological system will be challenged by the increasing
   unpredictability of rainfall.},

Title = {Implementing Participatory Water Management: Recent Advances in Theory,
   Practice, and Evaluation},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Many current water planning and management problems are riddled with
   high levels of complexity, uncertainty, and conflict, so-called
   ``messes{''} or ``wicked problems.{''} The realization that there is a
   need to consider a wide variety of values, knowledge, and perspectives
   in a collaborative decision making process has led to a multitude of new
   methods and processes being proposed to aid water planning and
   management, which include participatory forms of modeling, planning, and
   decision aiding processes. However, despite extensive scientific
   discussions, scholars have largely been unable to provide satisfactory
   responses to two pivotal questions: (1) What are the benefits of using
   participatory approaches?; (2) How exactly should these approaches be
   implemented in complex social-ecological settings to realize these
   potential benefits? In the study of developing social-ecological system
   sustainability, the first two questions lead to a third one that extends
   beyond the one-time application of participatory approaches for water
   management: (3) How can participatory approaches be most appropriately
   used to encourage transition to more sustainable ecological, social, and
   political regimes in different cultural and spatial contexts? The answer
   to this question is equally open. This special feature on participatory
   water management attempts to propose responses to these three questions
   by outlining recent advances in theory, practice, and evaluation related
   to the implementation of participatory water management. The feature is
   largely based on an extensive range of case studies that have been
   implemented and analyzed by cross-disciplinary research teams in
   collaboration with practitioners, and in a number of cases in close
   cooperation with policy makers and other interested parties such as
   farmers, fishermen, environmentalists, and the wider public.},

Title = {Trade-offs in adapting to changes in climate, land use, and water
   availability in California},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {. Changes in land use and land cover, water systems, and climate are
   inextricably linked, and their combined stresses have had severe impacts
   in many regions worldwide. Integrated adaptation planning can support
   adaptive capacity by helping institutions manage land and water
   resources at regional to local scales. Linkages between these stressors
   mean that planners are often faced with potential trade-offs, and how to
   couple social and environmental sustainability remains a key question.
   We explore these questions in California's Central Coast, a region that
   is already experiencing serious water shortages, housing shortages,
   rapid expansion of perennial agriculture, and severe droughts that are
   projected to become worse with climate change. Linked models of land use
   change (the Land Use and Carbon + Water Simulator {[}LUCAS-W]), water
   resources (LUCAS-W), and climate (the Basin Characterization Model
   {[}BCM]) produced forecasts of exposure to regional changes at 270-m
   resolution. We worked with regional stakeholders to develop a matrix of
   nine vulnerability measures that assessed key sensitivities to these
   changes. Each vulnerability measure combined one of the three exposure
   projections with spatial datasets representing one of three sensitivity
   communities (agricultural, domestic, or ecological). We assessed how
   five scenarios of land-use and water management strategies under
   consideration by regional planners could provide institutional, top-down
   adaptive capacity, and whether there were trade-offs in sustainable
   development goals for these communities. We found that specific land and
   water management strategies could greatly reduce regional vulnerability,
   particularly programs to cap water extractions to sustainable levels.
   The most dramatic trade-off was between the strategy of water demand
   caps that increased risk of habitat loss and ecosystem preservation that
   increased water vulnerability. However, trade-offs were usually limited
   and spatially localized, suggesting local tailoring of the strategies we
   assessed could reduce them. Trade-offs were more frequent across
   exposure classes (land use vs. water vs. climate changes) rather than
   sensitivity classes (agricultural vs. domestic vs. ecological
   communities), suggesting win-win opportunities for natural resource
   management. Our vulnerability maps can inform prioritization efforts for
   local adaptation planning.},

Abstract = {Land-use change has been associated with changes in the dynamics of
   infectious disease in West Africa. Here we describe the complex
   interactions of land-use change with three diseases (both vector- and
   non-vector-bome) of considerable public health significance in this
   region, namely, malaria and irrigation; epidemic meningitis and land
   degradation; onchocerciasis and deforestation. We highlight the
   confounding effect of climate variability, which acts as a driver of
   both land-use change and human health. We conclude, as have others, that
   the scale of observation always matters, and complex and dynamic
   feedbacks among social-ecological systems are not easily teased apart.
   We suggest that in order to establish the causal chain of interactions
   between land-use change and human health outcomes two approaches are
   necessary. The first is to have a thorough understanding of the
   aetiology of disease and the specific mechanisms by which land-use and
   climate variability affect the transmission of pathogens. This is
   achieved by focused, detailed studies encompassing a wide range of
   potential drivers, which are inevitably small scale and often cover
   short time periods. The second consists of large-scale studies of
   statistical associations between transmission indices or health outcomes
   and environmental variables stratified by known ecological or
   socio-economic confounders, and sufficient in size to overcome local
   biases in results. Such research activities need to be designed to
   inform each other if we are to develop predictive models for monitoring
   these diseases and to develop integrated programs for human health and
   sustainable land use.},

Abstract = {The Ci??naga Grande de Santa Marta is a wetland complex characterized by
   its high productivity and different systems of biodiversity use
   associated with water. The Ci??naga receives fresh water from rivers
   descending from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. Changes in the water
   dynamics of these rivers since the early twentieth century have been
   causing serious social and ecological changes in the region. The
   Aracataca river is one of these rivers that showed a drastic change in
   its water availability. In this research we study the relation between
   cooperation and hydrological dynamics that shapes the water governance
   system in this basin. The study combines quantitative data obtained from
   the hydrological description and qualitative information derived from
   interviews and a role-playing game workshop, which was analyzed from a
   social-ecological perspective. The analysis shows that the historical
   management of water, characterized by conflicts between individual and
   collective interests, power asymmetries, and the heterogeneity between
   actors, has established a problematic scenario. Our analysis at river
   basin scale showed difficulties in water governance regardless of water
   annual variability, thus requiring structural changes that allow the
   development of coordinated processes toward collective action. This
   research identifies elements that can enrich the management discourses
   of the Aracataca river basin and the Ci??naga as a whole, highlighting
   the importance of understanding environmental issues as problems of
   common pool resources.},

Abstract = {This study assesses social vulnerability to hazards by analyzing the
   nature of biophysical hazards, and the characteristics of exposures,
   susceptibilities and adaptive capacities in Kumasi. A mixed method
   approach was used to collect primary data from farms and nearby markets.
   Water, soil, and plant samples were collected and tested for total
   coliforms and cadmium. Primary dataset was also collected from farmers
   and vendors using structured interview guide and from key informants
   through in-depth interviews. The analysis shows that several pressures
   residing within the coupled social-ecological system are threats to the
   health and livelihood of the farmers and vendors. The concentration of
   cadmium and total coliform in irrigation water, soil, and plants
   exceeded the WHO/FAO acceptable standards. Bio-toxins in plants were
   also found to be potentially high. However, the degree of exposure to
   these stressors and the strength of response and adaptive capacities
   were determined to be dependent on position within the urban agriculture
   value chain, type of plant, and socio-demographic characteristics. The
   study concludes that pollution of irrigation water, soil, and plant is
   an issue of environmental concern in the urban agriculture system and
   requires concerted efforts of all stakeholders to address. It is
   recommended that there should be frequent monitoring of the quality of
   irrigation water, soil, and produce from urban farms and markets to
   assess their physical, chemical, and microbial properties and possibly
   initiate remedial measures where necessary. Government policies must
   also focus on building the resilience of urban farmers and vendors to
   reduce their vulnerability to biophysical hazards.},

Abstract = {Managing trade-offs among water uses in a river basin to sustain
   multiple ecosystem services is crucial for adaptation to changing river
   flow regimes. Here we analyze the trade-off between irrigation and
   fisheries in the Amudarya, a semi-arid river basin in Central Asia,
   using an optimal control and an agent-based modeling approach. With the
   optimal control approach (OCA), we identify the economic and ecological
   conditions for water sharing in a regime where a social manager controls
   water withdrawals and fish harvesting. With the agent-based model (ABM),
   we relax some of the assumptions of the OCA to investigate how
   localized, individual agents with varied water use histories adapt their
   water use activities to local resource conditions. Variation in the
   farmers' initial labor allocations to the two activities results in
   regimes with only one activity or both. Global returns and income
   equality are highest in a mixed regime. The mixed regimes also are more
   robust to water variability because fishing activities can compensate
   for decreased agricultural performance in the midstream regions. Thus,
   allowing for multiple uses can improve the coupled social-ecological
   system's performance and its resilience. We also observe a lock-in
   effect similar to the current situation in the Amudarya, where
   agriculture is the dominant water use and transition to a more balanced
   allocation has proven to be extremely difficult. As in the ABM, this can
   to some extent be attributed to the difficulties of achieving sufficient
   revenues from fishing when agricultural activities upstream are high.
   Regulations or incentives are needed to overcome those barriers, and to
   facilitate progress towards integrated water management.},

Abstract = {Our research addresses the gap in scientific research on the fine-grain
   spatial patterns and social-ecological interactions of land use and
   agrobiodiversity. The spatial dimension of agrobiodiversity dynamics
   potentially strengthens the social-ecological resilience and food
   security of smallholders by buffering risk and vulnerability. Our
   research integrates the scientific theories, concepts, and methods of
   spatial externalities, social-ecological interactions, geospatial land
   and global change sciences, and political ecology. We designed a case
   study of the Arbieto-Tarata landscape in the Bolivian Andes that
   comprises a globally significant agrobiodiversity hot spot of Andean
   maize. The Arbieto-Tarata landscape, which contains nearly 8000 fields
   at 2500-2800 masl, is representative of mixed-use smallholder agri-food
   systems amid global changes. Our research predicts spatial spillover and
   edge effects of combined social and environmental factors leading to the
   clustering of same-crop fields. Findings reveal significant levels of
   the predicted clustering between 2006 and 2012. The degree of this
   clustering is found to differ among geographic and environmental
   sub-areas reflecting fine-grain variation of local causal linkages.
   Extra-local causal linkages include high levels of migration, water
   resource shortages, and urbanization. Results show the influences of
   informal and formal coordination in the spatial clustering of same-crop
   fields. This field-level coordination improves the efficiency of
   resource allocations and lowers costs of production. It enables the
   viability of high-agrobiodiversity Andean maize in smallholder land use
   and agri-food systems amid global changes. The article discusses the
   broader policy and scientific implications of these findings including
   scaling up and support of the social-ecological resilience of
   agrobiodiversity globally.},

Title = {Toward the Integrated Framework Analysis of Linkages among
   Agrobiodiversity, Livelihood Diversification, Ecological Systems, and
   Sustainability amid Global Change},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Scientific and policy interest in the biological diversity of
   agriculture (agrobiodiversity) is expanding amid global socioeconomic
   and environmental changes and sustainability interests. The majority of
   global agrobiodiversity is produced in smallholder food-growing. We use
   meta-analyses in an integrated framework to examine the interactions of
   smallholder agrobiodiversity with: (1) livelihood processes, especially
   migration, including impacts on agrobiodiversity as well as the
   interconnected resource systems of soil, water, and uncultivated
   habitats; and (2) plant-soil ecological systems. We hypothesize these
   interactions depend on: (1) scope of livelihood diversification and type
   resource system; and (2) plant residues and above-/belowground component
   ecological specificity. Findings show: (1) livelihood diversification is
   linked to varied environmental factors that range from rampant
   degradation to enhancing sustainability; and (2) significant ecological
   coupling of aboveground and soil agrobiodiversity (AGSOBIO assemblages).
   The environmental impacts of livelihood interactions correspond to
   variation of diversification (migration, on-farm diversification) and
   resource system (i.e., agrobiodiversity per se, soil, water). Our
   findings also reveal mutually dependent interactions of aboveground and
   soil agrobiodiversity. Results identify livelihood
   diversification-induced reduction of environmental resource quality with
   lagged agrobiodiversity declines as a potentially major avenue of global
   change. Our contribution re-frames livelihood interactions to include
   both agrobiodiversity and ecological systems. We discuss this integrated
   social-environmental re-framing through the proposed spatial geographic
   schema of regional agri-food spaces with distinctive matrices of
   livelihood strategies and relations to biodiversity and resources. This
   re-framing can be used to integrate livelihood, agrobiodiversity, and
   ecological analysis and to guide policy and scientific approaches for
   sustainability in agriculture and food-growing.},

Title = {Social-ecological vulnerability to climate change in the Nepali Himalaya},
Journal = {APPLIED GEOGRAPHY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {74-86},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The climate sensitive social-ecological systems of the Nepali Himalaya
   are increasingly exposed to the impacts of rapid climate change. As a
   result, the changing climate is negatively impacting upon livelihoods of
   the region. Effective adaptation responses could reduce the negative
   impacts Of change, and assessments of vulnerability of local
   social-ecosystems are helping to initiate that process. However,
   insufficient research has assessed climate change-induced vulnerability
   of Nepali Himalayan social-ecosystems at different scales. This study
   measures the vulnerability of social-ecosystems at the household level
   and within three village clusters of the Kaligandaki Basin in the
   Central Himalaya, Nepal. The clusters represent different ecological
   zones: Meghauli in the hot and wet tropical Tarai; Lumle in the cool,
   wet temperate Middle-Mountains; and Upper-Mustang in the cold and dry
   Trans-Himalaya. Data on the exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity
   of the social-ecosystems were collected through face-to-face interviews
   with 360 households. Exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity
   sub-indices were calculated and integrated to develop the vulnerability
   indices. The social-ecosystems reveal significant levels of exposure to
   climate change and are sensitive to change and extreme weather events,
   but limited capacities to adapt across all spatial scales result in very
   high social-ecological vulnerability. Yet, there is variation in the
   levels of vulnerability across the households, primarily because of
   different non-climatic factors such as the livelihood assets that a
   household commands. Given that many Nepali households have very limited
   adaptive capacities, the country requires an adaptation policy to
   address the needs of the most vulnerable households through a `poor
   people first' approach, before adaptation planning and investment is
   extended gradually to reduce the vulnerability of social-ecosystems
   across the country. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Integrating Institutions with Local Contexts in Community-Based
   Irrigation Governance: A Qualitative Systematic Review of Variables,
   Combinations, and Effects},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Pages = {320-337},
Abstract = {The literature on common-pool resources (CPRs) has mostly focused on
   institutional conditions for successful governance of the commons.
   However, many scholars have emphasized that the explanatory power of
   institutional variables per se is limited and that institutions should
   not be isolated from the context in which they operate. Consequently,
   the success of CPR governance requires a more nuanced understanding of
   specific combinations of institutions in a specific social-ecological
   context. Using community based irrigation systems as an example, this
   paper examines how combinations of institutions and contexts affect
   irrigation governance based on a qualitative systematic review of 83
   English language peer-reviewed articles published since 1990. The review
   firstly summarizes the basic characteristics, main research subjects,
   and development trends in the literature on community-based irrigation
   governance. Then, revealing the specific effects of major combinations
   of institutional variables and contextual variables on the performance
   of irrigation governance, the review suggests that (a) the congruence of
   institutional arrangements with attributes of actors (e.g., group size,
   group heterogeneity, and social capital), (b) the specific combination
   of institutions and contexts of resource system and related ecosystems
   (e.g., hydrology, soil, and agriculture), and (c) the market incentives
   (e.g., irrigation systems' spatial proximity to markets) associating
   with formal governance organizations, are important for improving
   irrigation governance performance. The main findings not only reveal
   existing gaps in understanding how institutions and contexts interact in
   community-based irrigation governance, but also indicate potential
   pathways to theoretical construction in complex CPR systems by further
   exploring the relationships between institutions and the contexts in
   which they operate.},

Title = {Institutions of farmer participation and environmental sustainability: a
   multi-level analysis from irrigation management in Harran Plain, Turkey},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {73-91},
Abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between farmer participation and
   environmental sustainability from an institutional perspective in the
   context of Harran Plain, one of the newest and largest irrigated areas
   in Turkey. Harran Plain undergoes social, economic and institutional
   change due to the expansion of large-scale irrigation and the
   establishment of irrigation associations. These changes, however,
   trigger an environmental change in the form of waterlogging and soil
   salinisation. The concepts of `institutional scale' and `institutional
   alignment' are applied to critically analyse the narratives regarding
   the causes of excessive water use, which is a collective action problem
   playing a significant role in increased waterlogging and soil salinity
   in Harran Plain. Empirical findings demonstrate that a low degree of
   institutional alignment among the rules at different levels constitutes
   an obstacle against taking actions to prevent excessive water use. Major
   issues are identified as the lack of water rights at plot and district
   levels; the exclusion of farmers from the planning of irrigation
   seasons; the inefficient monitoring of irrigation frequencies and fee
   collections, and the lack of mechanisms to monitor the operations of
   irrigation associations. The application of institutional scale and
   institutional alignment also contribute to the understanding of
   social-ecological systems by facilitating the systematic analysis of
   institutions and the identification of areas for institutional change.},

Title = {Socio-hydrology: an interplay of design and self-organization in a
   multilevel world},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The emerging field of socio-hydrology is a special case of
   social-ecological systems research that focuses on coupled human-water
   systems, exploring how the hydrologic cycle and human cultural traits
   coevolve and how such coevolutions lead to phenomena of relevance to
   water security and sustainability. As such, most problems tackled by
   socio-hydrology involve some aspects of engineering design, such as
   large-scale water infrastructure, and self-organization in a broad
   context, such as cultural change at the population level and the
   hydrologic shift at the river basin or aquifer level. However, within
   the field of socio-hydrology, it has been difficult to find general
   theories that assist our understanding of the dynamics emerging from the
   interplay between design and self-organization, hindering generalization
   of phenomena between cases. We address this gap by developing insights
   on how the theoretical frameworks of robustness-fragility trade-off and
   cultural multilevel selection can inform our understanding in this
   regard. We apply the two theories to two cases in the Ganges Brahmaputra
   Delta in Bangladesh and the Kissimmee River Basin in Florida,
   illustrating how the two theories may provide general insights into
   causal mechanisms shaping the socio-hydrological phenomena observed in
   the two cases. Specifically, we use the two theories to address (1) the
   transference of system fragility across different domains due to design
   choices and (2) the multilevel social processes in the nested
   organizational hierarchy that lead to the formation or collapse of
   shared cultural traits. We show that these two theories, separately or
   taken together, can provide richer theoretical grounding for
   understanding socio-hydrological phenomena.},

Title = {Design and quality criteria for archetype analysis},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A key challenge in addressing the global degradation of natural
   resources and the environment is to effectively transfer successful
   strategies across heterogeneous contexts. Archetype analysis is a
   particularly salient approach in this regard that helps researchers to
   understand and compare patterns of (un)sustainability in heterogeneous
   cases. Archetype analysis avoids traps of overgeneralization and
   ideography by identifying reappearing but nonuniversal patterns that
   hold for well-defined subsets of cases. It can be applied by researchers
   working in inter- or transdisciplinary settings to study sustainability
   issues from a broad range of theoretical and methodological standpoints.
   However, there is still an urgent need for quality standards to guide
   the design of theoretically rigorous and practically useful archetype
   analyses. To this end, we propose four quality criteria and
   corresponding research strategies to address them: (1) specify the
   domain of validity for each archetype, (2) ensure that archetypes can be
   combined to characterize single cases, (3) explicitly navigate levels of
   abstraction, and (4) obtain a fit between attribute configurations,
   theories, and empirical domains of validity. These criteria are based on
   a stocktaking of current methodological challenges in archetypes
   research, including: to demonstrate the validity of the analysis,
   delineate boundaries of archetypes, and select appropriate attributes to
   define them. We thus contribute to a better common understanding of the
   approach and to the improvement of the research design of future
   archetype analyses.},

Title = {Modeling Soft Institutional Change and the Improvement of Freshwater
   Governance in the Coastal Zone},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The contribution of soft institutional change to improve freshwater
   governance in the coastal zone will be examined. Freshwater management
   seeks to reduce losses due to overexploitation of the common-pool
   resources provided by river catchments and their associated ecosystems.
   Due to the complexity of the governance system, improving the
   performance of one coastal social-ecological system means searching for
   the appropriate ``soft{''} institutional change. In the Pertuis
   Charentais region, increasing scarcity of freshwater in summer threatens
   the health of the coastal ecosystem and the sustainability of human
   activities, which depend on the use of natural resources. The allocation
   of freshwater among competing uses or concerns is a core issue for
   integrated coastal zone management. To address this issue, we have
   constructed an analytical framework that combines the ecosystem services
   approach with the institutional analysis of common-pool resources, and
   have developed an integrated simulation tool based on the system dynamic
   modeling approach. Freshwater scarcity generates three kinds of user
   conflict: (1) conflict between two extractive uses of freshwater
   (irrigation and drinking water), (2) conflicts between extractive uses
   (provisioning services) and other services (support, regulatory, and
   cultural) provided by freshwater, and (3) competition within a given
   activity sector (agriculture or shellfish farming). Participation by
   local managers led to the identification of realistic soft institutional
   changes that might mitigate conflicts and improve the governance system.
   These possible institutional changes were then integrated as fixed
   exogenous parameters in the simulation model. The simulated scenarios
   suggest that innovative collective arrangements involving farmers could
   be an alternative to other more restrictive top-down measures. This
   participatory experiment also illustrates the potential of
   social-ecological modeling for exploring acceptable new institutional
   arrangements.},

Title = {Toward hydro-social modeling: Merging human variables and the social
   sciences with climate-glacier runoff models (Santa River, Peru)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {518},
Number = {A, SI},
Pages = {60-70},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {Glacier shrinkage caused by climate change is likely to trigger
   diminished and less consistent stream flow in glacier-fed watersheds
   worldwide. To understand, model, and adapt to these
   climate-glacier-water changes, it is vital to integrate the analysis of
   both water availability (the domain of hydrologists) and water use (the
   focus for social scientists). Drawn from a case study of the Santa River
   watershed below Peru's glaciated Cordillera Blanca mountain range, this
   paper provides a holistic hydro-social framework that identifies five
   major human variables critical to hydrological modeling because these
   forces have profoundly influenced water use over the last 60 years: (1)
   political agendas and economic development; (2) governance: laws and
   institutions; (3) technology and engineering; (4) land and resource use;
   and (5) societal responses. Notable shifts in Santa River water
   use-including major expansions in hydroelectricity generation,
   large-scale irrigation projects, and other land and resource-use
   practices did not necessarily stem from changing glacier runoff or
   hydrologic shifts, but rather from these human variables. Ultimately,
   then, water usage is not predictable based on water availability alone.
   Glacier runoff conforms to certain expected trends predicted by models
   of progressively reduced glacier storage. However, societal forces
   establish the legal, economic, political, cultural, and social drivers
   that actually shape water usage patterns via human modification of
   watershed dynamics. This hydro-social framework has widespread
   implications for hydrological modeling in glaciated watersheds from the
   Andes and Alps to the Himalaya and Tien Shan, as well as for the
   development of climate change adaptation plans. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {The Promise of Collective Action for Large-Scale Commons Dilemmas:
   Reflections on Common-Pool-Resource Theory},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {47-63},
Abstract = {It has become axiomatic that collective action is core to overcoming
   commons dilemmas. However, the popularity of the commons dilemma framing
   has led to its decoupling from canonical common-pool-resource cases.
   This decoupling is especially problematic for theorizing under what
   conditions collective action would emerge to solve complex, large-scale
   environmental problems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, or
   ocean hypoxia. We argue that there is an over-emphasis on using
   diagnostic tools (e.g., the design principles), which has come at the
   expense of theory building for non-canonical cases. Canonical cases,
   such as fisheries, forests, or irrigation networks, rely on situations
   where salience of social dilemmas arises from joint costs and benefits
   actors face from allocating and sustaining a shared pool of
   livelihood-dependent resources. By expanding the commons definition to
   more generally mean shared needs or benefits, such as ecosystem
   services, the consequences of uses in large-scale CPRs, such as
   pollution, become less obvious. In this paper, we argue that it is
   particularly urgent to generate a revised theory of collective action
   for these types of cases, where environmental bads are core to the
   social dilemma. We contend that Ostrom's design principles represent a
   particular set of solutions to several interconnected and foundational
   aspects of group problem-solving: generating salience, achieving
   widespread participation, and ensuring compliance over time. We argue
   that reconceptualizing how particular institutional arrangements address
   salience, participation, and compliance can expand CPR theory's
   applicability to these large-scale problems and help to clarify the role
   that collective action can play in solving these pressing challenges.},

Title = {Is ecological vulnerability assessment based on the VSD model and
   AHP-Entropy method useful for loessial forest landscape protection and
   adaptative management? A case study of Ziwuling Mountain Region, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Ecological vulnerability assessment is an effective tool to aid
   decision-makers in understanding the impact of natural and anthropogenic
   variables on ecosystems. Yet, we know little about incorporating
   ecological vulner-ability into accurate decision-making for climate
   change adaptation and human activities governance. This study proposes a
   comprehensive framework to link the Vulnerability Scoping Diagram (VSD)
   model, Analytic Hier-archy Process-Entropy method, hot spot and cluster
   analysis into ecological vulnerability assessment and man-agement in the
   Ziwuling Mountain Region (ZMR), a typical loessial forest landscape in
   arid China. There were significant spatial and temporal changes in the
   exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity index in the ZMR from 1990
   to 2017. The exposure and adaptive capacity index increased from 1990 to
   2017. The subareas with a high exposure value were distributed in the
   north and south ZMR, and the subareas with a high adaptive capacity
   value were distributed in the east ZMR. The ecological vulnerability
   declined during the study period, with the smaller value subareas
   allocated in the middle and south ZMR and higher value in the north and
   southwest. Significant spatial clustering patterns on the hot and cold
   spots of ecological vulnerability existed in the ZMR. The clustering
   subareas of hot spots on ecological vulnerability were mainly
   characterized by dry steppe, less precipitation, and less vegetation
   coverage. The subareas of cold spots of ecological vulnerability were
   domi-nated by forestry and forestry-agricultural landscapes. Some
   suggestions and countermeasures were put forward for adaptive management
   and sustainability enhancement. Our results provide integrative methods
   linking the VSD model, AHP-entropy method, hot spot and cluster analysis
   to ecological vulnerability reduction and adaptive management for
   dryland sustainability, especially for the forest social-ecological
   systems in the Chinese Loess Plateau.},

Title = {A dynamic assessment of water scarcity risk in the Lower Brahmaputra
   River Basin: An integrated approach},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {120-131},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Many international river basins are likely to experience increasing
   water scarcity over the coming decades. This water scarcity is not
   rooted only in the limitation of resources, i.e. the shortage in the
   availability of freshwater relative to water demand, but also on social
   factors (e.g. flawed water planning and management approaches,
   institutional incapability to provide water services, unsustainable
   economic policies). Therefore, the assessment of water scarcity risks is
   not limited to the assessment of physical water supply and demand, but
   it requires also consideration of several socio-economic factors. In
   this study, we provide a comprehensive dynamic assessment of water
   scarcity risks for the Lower Brahmaputra river basin, a region where the
   hydrological impact of climate change is expected to be particularly
   strong and population pressure is high. The basin area of Brahmaputra
   River lies among four different countries: China, India, Bangladesh and
   Bhutan. For water scarcity assessment, we propose a novel integration of
   different approaches: (i) the assessment of water scarcity risk,
   considering complex social-ecological system; (ii) the analysis of
   dynamic behaviour of the system; (iii) exploration of participatory
   approach in which limited number of stakeholders identify the most
   relevant issues with reference to water scarcity risks and provide their
   preferences for the aggregation of risk assessment indicators. Results
   show that water scarcity risk is expected to slightly increase and to
   fluctuate remarkably as a function of the hazard signal. Social
   indicators show trends that can at least partially compensate the
   increasing trend of the drought index. The results of this study are
   intended to be used for contributing to planned adaptation of water
   resources systems, in Lower Brahmaputra River Basin. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {Mediterranean land systems: Representing diversity and intensity of
   complex land systems in a dynamic region},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {165},
Pages = {102-116},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In the Mediterranean region, land systems have been shaped gradually
   through centuries. They provide services to a large and growing
   population in a region that is among the most vulnerable to future
   global change. The spatial extent and distribution of Mediterranean land
   systems is, however, unknown. In this paper, we present a new,
   expert-based classification of Mediterranean land systems, representing
   landscapes as integrated social ecological systems. We combined data on
   land cover, management intensity and livestock available on the European
   and global scale in a geographic information system based approach. We
   put special emphasis on agro-silvo-pastoral mosaic systems:
   multifunctional Mediterranean landscapes hosting different human
   activities that are not represented in common land cover maps. By
   analyzing location conditions of the identified land systems, we
   demonstrated the significance of both bio-physical (precipitation, soil)
   and socio-economic (population density, Market influence) factors
   driving the occurrence of these systems. Agro-silvo-pastoral mosaic
   systems were estimated to cover 23.3\% of the Mediterranean ecoregion
   and exhibited to a certain extent similar characteristics as forest and
   cropland systems. A reanalysis using data that are available with global
   coverage indicated that the choice of datasets leads to significant
   uncertainties in the extent and spatial pattern of these systems. The
   resulting land systems typology can be used to prioritize and protect
   landscapes of high cultural and environmental significance.},

Title = {Identifying Farming Strategies Associated With Achieving Global
   Agricultural Sustainability},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 7},
Abstract = {Sustainable agroecosystems provide adequate food while supporting
   environmental and human wellbeing and are a key part of the United
   Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Some strategies to promote
   sustainability include reducing inputs, substituting conventional crops
   with genetically modified (GM) alternatives, and using organic
   production. Here, we leveraged global databases covering 121 countries
   to determine which farming strategies-the amount of inputs per area
   (fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation), GM crops, and percent
   agriculture in organic production-are most correlated with 12
   sustainability metrics recognized by the United Nations Food and
   Agriculture Organization. Using quantile regression, we found that
   countries with higher Human Development Indices (HDI) (including
   education, income, and lifespan), higher-income equality, lower food
   insecurity, and higher cereal yields had the most organic production and
   inputs. However, input-intensive strategies were associated with greater
   agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, countries with more
   GM crops were last on track to meeting the SDG of reduced inequalities.
   Using a longitudinal analysis spanning 2004-2018, we found that
   countries were generally decreasing inputs and increasing their share of
   agriculture in organic production. Also, in disentangling correlation
   vs. causation, we hypothesize that a country's development is more
   likely to drive changes in agricultural strategies than vice versa.
   Altogether, our correlative analyses suggest that countries with greater
   progress toward the SDGs of no poverty, zero hunger, good health and
   wellbeing, quality education, decent work, economic growth, and reduced
   inequalities had the highest production of organic agriculture and, to a
   lesser extent, intensive use of inputs.},

Title = {Multi-Loop Social Learning for Sustainable Land and Water Governance:
   Towards a Research Agenda on the Potential of Virtual Learning Platforms},
Journal = {NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES},

Volume = {69},

Month = {JUN 6},
Abstract = {Managing social-ecological systems and human well being in a sustainable
   way requires knowledge of these systems in their full complexity.
   Multi-loop social learning is recognized as a crucial element to
   sustainable decision-making for land and water resources management
   involving a process of managing change where the central methodological
   concern is with effectively engaging the necessary participation of
   system members in contributing to the collective knowledge of the
   system. Ensuring the inclusion of the community of concern may help to
   ensure robust knowledge, the necessary plurality of views,
   responsibility sharing and trust enhancement. This will also provide
   more dynamic lines of input to problem solving: local and changing forms
   of knowledge, emerging concerns and constraints all feed into an ongoing
   decision-making process. This conceptual paper is focused specifically
   on identifying the key drivers and conditions that facilitate multi-loop
   social learning and the untapped potential of virtual learning platforms
   in this context. The hyper-connectivity that characterizes digitally
   mediated networks opens up significant possibilities for information
   exchange, knowledge creation, feedback, debate, learning and innovation,
   social networking, and so on. This paper provides a thorough literature
   review of the conditions and affordances that are conducive to
   multi-loop social learning in the context of sustainable land and water
   governance. The insights from this review confirm the potential of a
   `learning ecology' or virtual learning platform for knowledge
   co-production, trust building, sense making, critical self-reflection,
   vertical and horizontal collaboration, and conflict resolution, while
   serving as a facilitating platform between different levels of
   governance, and across resource and knowledge systems. To conclude this
   paper, a developmental research agenda is proposed to refine and improve
   understanding of multi-loop social learning processes and their
   effective facilitation through virtual learning platforms. (C) 2014

Title = {Assessing levels, trade-offs and synergies of landscape services in the

Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Pages = {305-327},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Context Evidence-based knowledge is crucial for place-based knowledge
   production and learning towards sustainable landscapes through
   stewardship and integrated spatial planning. Objectives We focus on the
   landscape service concept as a tool, and three fundamental challenges
   for its use: (1) how to monitor benefits provided by different
   landscapes; (2) to demonstrate trade-offs and synergies among benefits
   in a landscape; and (3) to discuss how to incorporate results from
   analyses into landscape stewardship and planning. Methods As a case
   study we chose the Iranian Qazvin province with diverse natural and
   anthropogenic landscapes, and top-down societal steering. Five landscape
   services (water yield, water regulation, pollination, actual net primary
   production (NPPact) and social-cultural connectivity) were assessed and
   compared. Results All landscape services were significantly correlated.
   Major trade-offs and synergies among services were between NPPact and
   water yield and regulation. Trade-off and synergy clusters showed that
   landscape functions depend on both natural and anthropogenic landscape
   patterns and processes. Conclusions Providing transparent data about
   trade-offs and synergies among landscape services can facilitate
   learning about which services are important among landscapes. For each
   of six settings we suggest action plans. We discuss the role of Iranian
   landscape stewardship and planning, and integrative research needs.},

Title = {The Cross-scale Interplay between Social and Biophysical Context and the
   Vulnerability of Irrigation-dependent Societies: Archaeology's Long-term
   Perspective},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {What relationships can be understood between resilience and
   vulnerability in social-ecological systems? In particular, what
   vulnerabilities are exacerbated or ameliorated by different sets of
   social practices associated with water management? These questions have
   been examined primarily through the study of contemporary or recent
   historic cases. Archaeology extends scientific observation beyond all
   social memory and can thus illuminate interactions occurring over
   centuries or millennia. We examined trade-offs of resilience and
   vulnerability in the changing social, technological, and environmental
   contexts of three long-term, pre-Hispanic sequences in the U.S.
   Southwest: the Mimbres area in southwestern New Mexico (AD 650-1450),
   the Zuni area in northern New Mexico (AD 850-1540), and the Hohokam area
   in central Arizona (AD 700-1450). In all three arid landscapes, people
   relied on agricultural systems that depended on physical and social
   infrastructure that diverted adequate water to agricultural soils.
   However, investments in infrastructure varied across the cases, as did
   local environmental conditions. Zuni farming employed a variety of
   small-scale water control strategies, including centuries of reliance on
   small runoff agricultural systems; Mimbres fields were primarily watered
   by small-scale canals feeding floodplain fields; and the Hohokam area
   had the largest canal system in pre-Hispanic North America. The cases
   also vary in their historical trajectories: at Zuni, population and
   resource use remained comparatively stable over centuries, extending
   into the historic period; in the Mimbres and Hohokam areas, there were
   major demographic and environmental transformations. Comparisons across
   these cases thus allow an understanding of factors that promote
   vulnerability and influence resilience in specific contexts.},

Title = {Mesquite management in the Mezquital Valley: A sustainability assessment
   based on the view point of the Hnahnu indigenous community},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The indigenous community of El Alberto (Ixmiquilpan, Mexico), in the
   Mezquital Valley, has applied numerous uses of the mesquite (Prosopis
   laevigata) resources in their daily life for decades. Our objective was
   to understand the relationship between the rural community and this
   leguminous tree, to determine how sustainable their management is. For
   this purpose, we applied the Framework for the Evaluation of Management
   Systems using Indicators (MESMIS, Spanish acronym). Twenty-one
   indicators were identified, and a qualitative index was established to
   assign a sustainability value. The results identified fuelwood,
   fertility, forage and shade as the principal uses of mesquite nowadays.
   The local indigenous community does not promote the propagation of this
   leguminous tree but rather rely on its natural regeneration. However,
   the rate at which they cut down and exploit mesquite is higher than the
   natural regeneration rate, reflecting a low level of sustainable
   management. Strong equity was registered. First, there is a passive
   process associated with the construction of irrigation channels for
   agriculture, which resulted in the deforestation of the mesquite.
   Second, there is evidence of an active process where members of the
   community decide to migrate abandoning their indigenous world view,
   which, consequently, has impacted negatively on the mesquite resource.
   Change processes caused a shift in the community's worldview and led to
   cultural erosion. In conclusion, changes must be made to the community's
   current social ecological system to achieve sustainable management, such
   as building a strong feeling of community identity, evolution of the
   community's uses, customs, quality and lifestyle, and their
   collaboration with the scientific community.},

Title = {Traditional agricultural practices and their contribution to habitat
   quality and carbon storage in arid Northwest Mexico: a social-ecological
   approach in the Rio Sonora sub-watershed},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Along with environmental factors, agricultural activity is one of the
   main drivers of change in riparian landscapes of arid regions. Some
   agricultural practices are considered more sustainability-oriented than
   others. Despite this, their use is not widespread and their effect on
   the provision of ecosystem services is not clearly established. Thus, we
   propose an empirical framework for studying the effects of traditional
   agricultural practices on regulating ecosystem services in priority and
   spatially restricted ecosystems. Through spatial analysis and community
   field work, this study assesses changes in the use of two traditional
   agricultural practices: living fencerows and acequia irrigation systems
   and their effect on biodiversity and ecosystem service: habitat quality
   and carbon storage. Results show that the use of living fencerows
   promotes habitat quality and carbon storage, but their use is restricted
   by functional and socioeconomic factors. Acequia systems promote the
   provision of carbon storage but have a negative influence on habitat
   quality, and their use is changing mainly due to environmental and
   functional factors. The presence of obligate riparian vegetation in
   different configurations maintains the highest values for habitat
   quality and carbon storage, but it doesn't provide the functional
   purpose of fencerows or acequias. We suggest that the expansion of
   voluntary and official conservation areas that promote regeneration of
   riparian vegetation adjacent and around agricultural areas could help
   mitigate floods, provide materials and suitable conditions for the
   maintenance of fencerows and acequias, enhance water and soil quality
   and many other services needed in agriculture. We consider our proposal
   to be useful for future assessments of ecosystem services tradeoffs and
   social-ecological dynamics in other understudied regions with
   predominantly agricultural activity.},

Title = {Reflexive learning in adaptive management: A case study of environmental
   water management in the Murray Darling Basin, Australia},
Journal = {RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {681-694},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Adaptive management is a structured approach for people who must act
   despite uncertainty and complexity about what they are managing and the
   impacts of their actions. It is learning-by-doing through deliberate
   cycles of experimentation, review, and synthesis. However, understanding
   the processes of learning and how they relate to achieving resource
   management goals is in its infancy. Reflexive learning-a process of
   identifying and critically examining assumptions, values, and actions
   that frame knowledge-is critical to the effectiveness of adaptive
   management. It involves adaptive feedbacks between stakeholders as they
   examine assumptions, values, and actions. Adaptive management has been
   applied to environmental flows because it offers a system for making
   decisions about tradeoffs. In the Murray Darling Basin (MDB), Australia,
   adaptive management is applied as a cycle of plan, do, monitor, and
   learn, facilitated by short- and long-term learning among stakeholders.
   An alternative conceptualization of adaptive management as an
   integration of single-, double-, and triple-loop learning across
   multiple levels of governance is presented. This is applied to
   environmental flows in the MDB to map adaptive feedbacks of reflexive
   learning. At the lowest level of governance (Water Resource Planning
   Area), goals are assessed as Thresholds of Potential Concern related to
   flow-ecology responses, which are reviewed every 3-6 years. At the
   second level of governance (Basin-States), Water Management Targets are
   the key goals; reviewed and reframed every 6-10 years. The highest level
   of governance (the MDB) is concerned with policy targets, with review
   and reframing over 8-15 years. Feedbacks that generate reflexive
   learning are complex and require commitment to move through the modes of
   single-, double-, and triple-loop learning. Effective adaptive
   management of environmental water requires practitioners to situate
   themselves within a matrix of information flow across modes of learning,
   levels of governance, and components of a social-ecological system,
   where reflexive learning drives the achievement of management goals.},

Title = {Evolutionary Model Discovery of Human Behavioral Factors Driving
   Decision-Making in Irrigation Experiments},
Journal = {JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR 31},
Abstract = {Small farms are thought to produce around a third of the global crop
   supply. But, in the wake of the climate crisis, their existence is
   increasingly vulnerable to changes in the spatial and temporal
   availability of water. The small-scale irrigation systems which water
   these farms present a social-ecological dilemma: Upstream farms have
   prevailing access to a canal's resources, but all farms along the canal
   must contribute to maintaining the irrigation infrastructure. Thus, it
   is key to assess the social mechanisms which promote resilience in these
   systems and, more widely, in complex social-ecological dilemmas under
   changing conditions. Toward this, we build on previous work in which a
   stylized irrigation dilemma was simulated via a social lab experiment.
   Studies of the data produced from this experiment modeled participants'
   behavior with multiple, theoretically grounded agent-based models
   (ABMs). These models encode causal, human-interpretable hypotheses of
   decision making which generates the real-world behavior observed in the
   experiment. However, the accuracy of these models in fitting the
   experimental data is limited. Using Evolutionary Model Discovery, a
   recent algorithm for inverse generative social science (iGSS), we show
   the ability to automatically generate a wide variety of unique new ABMs
   which fit the experimental data more accurately and robustly than the
   original, manually-constructed ABMs. To do this, we algorithmically
   explore the space of possible behavioral rules for agents choosing how
   to contribute to the maintenance of the irrigation infrastructure. We
   find that, in contrast to the original models, our best-performing
   models typically have an additional element of stochasticity and favor
   factors such as other-regarding preferences and perceived relative
   income. Given that this change in just a small part of the original
   model has yielded such an advance, our results suggest that iGSS methods
   have great potential for continuing to derive more accurate models of
   complex social-ecological dilemmas.},

   the institutional analysis and development framework},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {143},
Pages = {45-59},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {While increasing consensus has grown around the important role of
   monitoring in environmental resource governance, little is known about
   under what conditions people would rather pay private costs to implement
   monitoring and punishment. Using field survey data on communities and
   households from four suburb areas in China, this paper employs
   Institutional Analysis and Development framework to empirically examine
   households' willingness and actual activities on waste disposal
   monitoring. The empirical results show that population density,
   community modernization, and being male significantly increase the
   likelihood of households supervising waste disposal while community size
   and heterogeneity of wealth and ethnicity seriously impede the
   involvement of households in waste disposal supervision. More
   importantly, our estimation results reveal that staffing community with
   full-time cadres for sanitation management suppress the enthusiasm of
   households in conducting waste disposal supervision, but stock of social
   capital and peer monitoring substantially increase the intention to
   supervise waste disposal and the possibility of households engaging in
   waste disposal supervision activities. In addition, social norms,
   household income, and householder age are primary predictors of the
   intention-behavior gap between hypothetical willingness to monitor and
   actual monitoring behavior. Therefore, improving community
   infrastructure and economic condition, reducing external intervention on
   community affairs, and cultivating social capital stock are important
   approaches to enhance public participation in environmental governance.},

Title = {Infrastructure investments for resilience: Opportunities, barriers, and
   a future research agenda from the Orange-Senqu River Basin},
Journal = {CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {35},
Abstract = {Decision makers are under pressure to make strategic water
   infrastructure investments under climatic uncertainty. While governments
   are responding with investments in climate resilient infrastructure, the
   increasingly complex and unpredictable dynamics of the Anthropocene
   demand attention to the broader paradigm of resilience, which asks
   decision makers to situate investments in the dynamics of complex
   social-ecological systems. Doing so requires more explicit consideration
   of irreducible uncertainties beyond climate change and infrastructure
   functions and interdependencies beyond direct water supply. However, the
   path dependence of prevailing predict-and-control approaches limits
   transitions to resilience, and the established practices of different
   actors enable or constrain this transition in different ways. At the
   time of research, a large-scale climate resilient infrastructure project
   involving multiple countries in the OrangeSenqu River Basin was at
   pre-feasibility stage. Our research investigated this transboundary
   decision context to 1) understand how concepts indicative of a
   transition from a predict-and-control to resilience-oriented decision
   paradigm (i.e., uncertainty and multifunctionality) were conceptualized
   and integrated into a complex decision context and 2) explore how a
   group of actors with significant decision-making influence - project
   finance - could enable or constrain this transition. We showed that
   interviewees identified a wide range of uncertainties and efforts to
   explicitly consider them were underway. Still, the impact of these
   efforts was mediated by a continued reliance on established,
   predict-and-control decision approaches. Additionally,
   multifunctionality was primarily considered as direct economic benefits
   to various parties. Our exploratory analysis of the role of project
   finance actors uncovered several opportunities to enable transitions to
   resilience, such as expanding capacities to consider a more
   comprehensive scope of risk and leverage available risk mitigation
   measures. We conclude with a future research agenda, both to further
   investigate how multiple decision paradigms interact in real-world
   decision making and to leverage opportunities for finance actors to
   enable transitions to resilience.},

Title = {Western Ranchers' Perspectives on Enablers and Constraints to Flood
   Irrigation},

Abstract = {Flood irrigation on western rangelands is important for diverse social
   and ecological reasons, providing forage for many agricultural
   operations and maintaining many critical wetlands across the region.
   However, recent debate over the efficiency of flood irrigation and
   resulting transition to other ``more efficient{''} types of irrigation
   has put many of the working wet meadows sustained by flood irrigation at
   risk. As the sustainability of these landscapes is primarily dependent
   on ranchers' management decisions, we sought to gain a deeper
   understanding of factors influencing ranchers who flood irrigate and how
   these factors interrelate. We applied the Community Capitals Framework
   to explore what considerations act as enablers and constraints to
   maintaining flood irrigation and to evaluate the role of each type of
   capital in enabling and constraining the coproduction of working wet
   meadows for ranchers and the environment. Our qualitative analysis of
   facilitated workshop transcripts and observation notes from two study
   areas within the Intermountain West showed that ranchers perceived
   constraining and enabling factors of flood irrigation related to all
   seven types of community capitals: natural, financial, built, cultural,
   human, social, and political. The irrigation methods used by ranchers
   were heavily influenced by environmental components of the landscape
   rather than reflecting a choice among alternative methods. Other
   prominent enablers included a commitment toward maintaining the natural
   history of the landscape and the ranching lifestyle. Primary constraints
   included the impact of public misperception and the ability to pass
   their operation on to the next generation. Ranchers weighed multiple
   considerations simultaneously in a holistic, community-scale approach to
   management decisions and described how diverse enablers and constraints
   interacted to determine the viability of flood irrigation and ranching.
   These results indicate rancher decisions are driven by complex
   social-ecological considerations and demonstrate the importance of each
   capital type to rangeland conservation. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

Title = {Frontiers in paramo water resources research: A multidisciplinary
   assessment},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {892},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Interdisciplinary knowledge is necessary to achieve sustainable
   management of natural resources. However, research is still often
   developed in an exclusively disciplinary manner, hampering the capacity
   to holistically address environ-mental issues. This study focuses on
   paramo, a group of high-elevation ecosystems situated around \& SIM;3000
   to -5000 m a.s.l. in the Andes from western Venezuela and northern
   Colombia through Ecuador down to northern Peru, and in the highlands of
   Panama and Costa Rica in Central America. Paramo is a social-ecological
   system that has been inhabited and shaped by human activity since-10,000
   years BP. This system is highly valued for the water-related ecosystem
   services provided to millions of people because it forms the headwaters
   of major rivers in the Andean -Amazon region, including the Amazon
   River. We present a multidisciplinary assessment of peer-reviewed
   research on the abiotic (physical and chemical), biotic (ecological and
   ecophysiological), and social-political aspects and ele-ments of paramo
   water resources. A total of 147 publications were evaluated through a
   systematic literature review process. We found that thematically 58, 19,
   and 23 \% of the analyzed studies are related to the abiotic, biotic,
   and social-political aspects of paramo water resources, respectively.
   Geographically, most publications were developed in Ecuador (71 \% of
   the synthesized publications). From 2010 onwards, the understanding of
   hydrological processes including precipitation and fog dynamics,
   evapotranspiration, soil water transport, and runoff generation
   improved, particularly for the humid paramo of southern Ecuador.
   Investigations on the chemical quality of water generated by paramo are
   rare, providing little empirical support to the widespread belief that
   paramo environments generate water of high quality. Most ecological
   studies examined the coupling between paramo terrestrial and aquatic
   environ-ments, but few directly assessed in-stream metabolic and
   nutrient cycling processes. Studies focused on the connection between
   ecophysiological and ecohydrological processes influencing paramo water
   balance are still scarce and mainly related to the dominant vegetation
   in the Andean paramo, i.e., tussock grass (pajonal). Social-political
   studies ad-dressed paramo governance and the implementation and
   significance of water funds and payment for hydrological ser-vices.
   Studies directly addressing water use, access, and governance in paramo
   communities remain limited. Importantly, we found only a few
   interdisciplinary studies combining methodologies from at least two
   disciplines of different nature despite their value in supporting
   decision-making. We expect this multidisciplinary synthesis to be-come a
   milestone to foster interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary dialogue
   among individuals and entities involved in and committed to the
   sustainable management of paramo natural resources. Finally, we also
   highlight key frontiers in paramo water resources research, which in our
   view need to be addressed in the coming years/decades to achieve this
   goal.},

Title = {Applying a transdisciplinary process to define a research agenda in a
   smallholder irrigated farming system in South Africa},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {137},
Pages = {39-50},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Defining an agenda is critical to a research process, and a
   transdisciplinary approach is expected to improve relevance of an agenda
   and resultant research outputs. Given the complexity of farming systems,
   farmer differences and the involvement of different stakeholders, as
   well as the expectations of research funders, what contributions can be
   made by different interest groups to the construction of an actionable
   research agenda that produces locally relevant yet original, empirical
   and transferable findings? In a case study of smallholder irrigation in
   South Africa, we analyze how, using a transdisciplinary approach, a
   balance can be struck between the priorities of different stakeholders
   in defining a research agenda. A transdisciplinary approach was
   interpreted to entail full participation of diverse stakeholders and
   integration of different issues as key features. Stakeholder
   participation was mediated through formal platforms: the Learning and
   Practice Alliance (LPA) and the Community of Practice (CoP). Farmers and
   local extension workers participated through the CoP, while other
   stakeholders, including the public and private sector participated
   through the LPA. A five step participatory process aimed at allowing
   stakeholders to fully understand issues, contribute to and validate the
   research agenda was followed, utilizing a combination of methods,
   including field observation, photography and discussion. We observed
   that farmer and researcher participation occurred along two main
   continua, which we define as a `participation matrix' - one continuum
   relating to the contribution of knowledge and information, and the other
   to decision making. The participation matrix can be used as a reference
   framework for guiding the transdisciplinary definition of research
   agendas, to aid in balancing knowledge and priorities including local
   relevance, ownership, originality, and transferability of findings. We
   argue that the transdisciplinary process, mediated through structured
   stakeholder participation, open dialogue and continual validation by all
   stakeholders was time and resource intensive, but enabled each
   stakeholder group to contribute to the process distinctly, resulting in
   a research agenda that integrated different needs and expectations. (C)

Title = {Connecting changes in Euphrates River flow to hydropattern of the
   Western Mesopotamian Marshes},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {768},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {The Mesopotamian Marshlands are the largest wetland system in the Middle
   East. Historically, these marshes served as the floodplains of the
   Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and they are currently connected to these
   rivers via surface water feeder canals. Historically, the Mesopotamian
   marshes received consistent flood pulses during the spring season from
   March to May. In recent decades, however, several large dams have been
   constructed in the Tigris and Euphrates basins for irrigation purposes
   and power generation, severely altering the flow regime. which along
   with other direct anthropogenic activities, has severely degraded the
   marsh ecosystem. This work quantifies changes in the riverine flow
   regime and how they have affected the hydro-pattern of the western
   Mesopotamian marshes (focusing on the western Al-Hammar marsh) and
   describes the role of hydrological drivers that are important for marsh
   restoration. The total area of the Al-Hammar marshes has been reduced
   from an average of 2800 km(2) before 1970 to a minimum of 240 km(2) in
   recent decades, concomitant with reductions in annual average Euphrates
   River flow (at Hit) from 967 to 602 m(3)/s and marked flow regime
   alteration. While climate warming and reduced precipitation were
   observed in the basin, changes in the fundamental precipitation-flow
   relationship implicate infrastructural changes (upstream dams) as the
   primary reason for these changes. This analysis quantified how flow
   variability under historic and contemporary conditions have affected
   wetland area and other hydro-pattern characteristics and suggests that
   at an annual average of least 70 m(3)/s of water deliveries to the
   western Mesopotamian marsh are required to restore 1000 km(2) of wetland
   area. Our hope is that this focus on the river-marsh connection will
   help inform predictive models and scenario analysis for restoration of
   this unique social-ecological system. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Mapping socio-ecological resilience along the seven economic corridors
   of the Belt and Road Initiative},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {309},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a massive development plan in
   terms of scale and scope. It aims at facilitating China's connectivity
   with the rest of the world through trade, investment, and infrastructure
   projects. BRI encompasses seven economic corridors, which cover over 100
   countries. Consequently, the spectrum of their social and ecological
   conditions is diverse and broad. To date, no systematic BRI scale study
   exists to assess the ecological challenges of these economic corridors
   and associate the challenges with the BRI's capacity to cope with them.
   Thus, it is of profound importance to understand the complex
   interactions between human (socialeconomic) and natural (ecological)
   systems, which are essential to design sustainable development policies
   in this vast region. This challenging task requires innovative and
   interdisciplinary research approaches in a policy relevant way. We
   address this gap by presenting a data-driven geospatial analysis on this
   complex entity using the Social-Ecological Systems approach.
   Methodologically, we use resilience analysis, as an equilibrium concept
   of Ecological Vulnerability (EV) and Adaptive Capacity (AC). A
   high-resolution geospatial resilience (the ability to withstand and
   reorganize disruptions when experiencing changes) mapping is made for
   the river basins along the BRI corridors to identify the drivers of
   resilience from 1990 to 2015. The results reveal highly diverse patterns
   of these drivers across the BRI economic corridors. The differences
   among the corridors grew within the study period. The root cause for the
   low resilience along the 21st-C Maritime Silk Road (predominantly the
   African continent) is low adaptive capacity, whereas higher ecological
   vulnerability is the main reason along the
   Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar, China-Pakistan, China-Central-Asia-West
   Asia, and China-Indochina Peninsula economic corridors. Further
   adaptation measures are needed to mitigate the risks related to
   decreased AC levels and increased EV levels. Investments under the
   initiative should better combine adequate physical infrastructure with
   improving institutional (both human talent development and efficient
   governance) and economic capacities to cope with the existing ecological
   vulnerability challenges. Finally, this study highlights that over time,
   AC has shown notable improvements, particularly in Asia, and in contrast
   to a less volatile EV. The equilibrium analysis between AC and EV offers
   a valuable resource for policy and decision-makers to plan and manage
   social-ecological resilience challenges within the seven economic
   corridors of the BRI, and plan adaptation and mitigation strategies.},

Title = {Food security in the face of climate change: Adaptive capacity of
   small-scale social-ecological systems to environmental variability},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {40},
Pages = {82-91},

Abstract = {Improving the adaptive capacity of small-scale irrigation systems to the
   impacts of climate change is crucial for food security in Asia. This
   study analyzes the capacity of small-scale irrigation systems dependent
   on the Asian monsoon to adapt to variability in river discharge caused
   by climate change. Our study is motivated by the Pumpa irrigation
   system, a small-scale irrigation system located in Nepal that is a model
   for this type of system. We developed an agent-based model in which we
   simulated the decisions farmers make about the irrigation strategy to
   use according to available water flow. Given the uncertainty associated
   with how climate change may affect the Asian monsoon, we simulated the
   performance of the system under different projections of climate change
   in the region (increase and decrease in rainfall, reduction and
   expansion of the monsoon season, and changes in the timing of the onset
   of the monsoon). Accordingly to our simulations, farmers might need to
   adapt to rainfall intensification and a late onset in the monsoon
   season. The demands for collective action among farmers (e.g.
   infrastructure repair, meetings, decisions, etc.) might increase
   considerably due to climate change. Although our model suggests that
   investment in new infrastructure might increase the performance of the
   system under some climate change scenarios, the high inequality among
   farmers when water availability is reduced might hinder the efficiency
   of these measures due to a reduction of farmers' willingness to
   cooperate. Our modeling exercise helps to hypothesize about the most
   sensitive climate change scenarios for smallscale irrigation farming in
   Nepal and helps to frame a discussion of some possible solutions and
   fundamental trade-offs in the process of adaptation to improve for food
   and water security under climate change. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

Title = {Assessing impacts of social-ecological diversity on resilience in a
   wetland coupled human and natural system},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Theory posits that resilience of ecosystems increases when there is a
   diversity of agents (e.g., species) and linkages between them. If
   ecosystems are conceptualized as components of coupled human and natural
   systems, then a corollary would be that novel types of human-induced
   diversity may also foster resilience. We explored this hypothesis by
   studying how socially created diversity mediated the impact of a
   historically severe drought on a network of wetlands in the foothills of
   the California Sierra Nevada containing a metapopulation of the
   threatened California Black Rail (Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus).
   We examined how (1) diversity in motivations for land ownership affected
   use of irrigation water and response to drought; (2) differences in
   natural and irrigated water sources affected wetland drying in response
   to drought; and (3) these processes affected the persistence of rails
   and the transmission risk of West Nile virus (WNV), an emerging
   infectious disease that threatens people and rails. Wetlands were mostly
   fed by inefficiencies and leaks from the irrigation system. Wetlands
   with both natural and irrigated water sources were larger, wetter, and
   likelier to persist through drought because these two sources showed
   response diversity by drying at different times. Wetlands with diverse
   water sources also provided the best habitat for the California Black
   Rail, and irrigation appeared responsible for its persistence through
   the drought. Irrigation increased WNV transmission risk by increasing
   the quantity, but not the quality, of wetland habitats for mosquitoes.
   The impacts of social diversity were more ambiguous, with redundancy
   prevalent. However, profit-motivated landowners provided wetlands more
   irrigation during nondrought conditions, whereas other landowner types
   were more likely to continue providing irrigation during drought. Our
   results highlight that conservation in social-ecological systems
   requires assessing not only the value of historic ecological diversity,
   but also how novel types of socially induced diversity may benefit
   ecosystems.},

Title = {Twentieth century temperature and snow cover changes in the French Alps},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Changes in snow cover associated with the warming of the French Alps
   greatly influence social-ecological systems through their impact on
   water resources, mountain ecosystems, economic activities, and glacier
   mass balance. In this study, we investigated trends in snow cover and
   temperature over the twentieth century using climate model and
   reanalysis data. The evolution of temperature, precipitation and snow
   cover in the European Alps has been simulated with the Modele
   Atmospherique Regional (MAR) applied with a 7-km horizontal resolution
   and driven by ERA-20C (1902-2010) and ERA5 (1981-2018) reanalyses data.
   Snow cover duration and snow water equivalent (SWE) simulated with MAR
   are compared to the SAFRAN - SURFEX-ISBA-Crocus - MEPRA meteorological
   and snow cover reanalysis (S2M) data across the French Alps (1958-2018)
   and in situ glacier mass balance measurements. MAR outputs provide a
   realistic distribution of SWE and snow cover duration as a function of
   elevation in the French Alps. Large disagreements are found between the
   datasets in terms of absolute warming trends over the second part of the
   twentieth century. MAR and S2M trends are in relatively good agreement
   for the decrease in snow cover duration, with higher decreases at low
   elevation (similar to 5-10\%/decade). Consistent with other studies, the
   highest warming rates in MAR occur at low elevations (< 1000 m a.s.l) in
   winter, whereas they are found at high elevations (> 2000 m a.s.l) in
   summer. In spring, warming trends show a maximum at intermediate
   elevations (1500 to 1800 m). Our results suggest that higher warming at
   these elevations is mostly linked to the snow-albedo feedback in spring
   and summer caused by the disappearance of snow cover at higher elevation
   during these seasons. This work has evidenced that depending on the
   season and the period considered, enhanced warming at higher elevations
   may or may not be found. Additional analysis in a physically
   comprehensive way and more high-quality dataset, especially at high
   elevations, are still required to better constrain and quantify climate
   change impacts in the Alps and its relation to elevation.},

Abstract = {The implementation of environmental flow regimes offers a promising
   means to protect and restore riverine, wetland and estuarine ecosystems,
   their critical environmental services and cultural/societal values. This
   Special Issue expands the scope of environmental flows and water science
   in theory and practice, offering 20 papers from academics, agency
   researchers and non-governmental organisations, each with fresh
   perspectives on the science and management of environmental water
   allocations. Contributions confront the grand challenge for
   environmental flows and water management in the Anthropocenethe urgent
   need for innovations that will help to sustain the innate resilience of
   social-ecological systems under dynamic and uncertain environmental and
   societal futures. Basin-scale and regional assessments of flow
   requirements mark a necessary advance in environmental water science in
   the face of rapid changes in water-resource management activities
   worldwide (e.g. increases in dams, diversions, retention and reuse).
   Techniques for regional-scale hydrological and ecohydrological modelling
   support ecological risk assessment and identification of priority flow
   management and river restoration actions. Changing flood-drought cycles,
   long-term climatic shifts and associated effects on hydrological,
   thermal and water quality regimes add enormous uncertainty to the
   prediction of future ecological outcomes, regardless of environmental
   water allocations. An improved capacity to predict the trajectories of
   ecological change in rivers degraded by legacies of past impact
   interacting with current conditions and future climate change is
   essential. Otherwise, we risk unrealistic expectations from restoration
   of river and estuarine flow regimes. A more robust, dynamic and
   predictive approach to environmental water science is emerging. It
   encourages the measurement of process rates (e.g. birth rate,
   colonisation rate) and species traits (e.g. physiological requirements,
   morphological adaptations) as well as ecosystem states (e.g. species
   richness, assemblage structure), as the variables representing
   ecological responses to flow variability and environmental water
   allocations. Another necessary development is the incorporation of other
   environmental variables such as water temperature and sedimentary
   processes in flow-ecological response models. Based on contributions to
   this Special Issue, several recent compilations and the wider
   literature, we identify six major scientific challenges for further
   exploration, and seven themes for advancing the management of
   environmental water. We see the emerging frontier of environmental flows
   and water science as urgent and challenging, with numerous opportunities
   for reinvigorated science and methodological innovation in the expanding
   enterprise of environmental water linked to ecological sustainability
   and social well-being.},

Abstract = {Over the past 50 years, both financing and socioeconomic considerations
   in South India have shifted heavily towards improving urban
   infrastructure, causing rural services to be left behind. A recent
   report released by WHO and UNICEF states that over 884 million people,
   84\% of whom live in rural areas, use ``unimproved water sources{''} for
   domestic purposes. This paper considers the case study of Nalgonda, a
   district to the east of Hyderabad, India. Nalgonda struggles with three
   main issues concerning domestic water: high fluoride levels in
   groundwater have caused thousands of cases of dental and skeletal
   fluorosis; second, over two-thirds of Nalgonda does not meet the
   WHO-requirement of 40 liters per capita daily of domestic water supply;
   third, poor management and maintenance have increased the risk of
   failure of existing water infrastructure. The state has been pursuing
   these issues in conjunction with a multi-district irrigation project
   that taps the regional Nagarjuna Sagar Dam. Centralized water supply,
   treatment, and distribution services are appropriate for high population
   density areas; however, geographical expanse and sparse populations lead
   to onerous access to improved water sources and inhibit the success of a
   similar centralized framework in rural areas. This is compounded by a
   lack of ownership at the habitation and socio-cultural levels. Further,
   the current water network and its problems-including inconsistent
   service, corruption, and general distrust of the treated Sagar
   water-have emboldened wealthier citizens to build private, unregulated
   groundwater defluoridation plants and commercialize small-scale water
   businesses.
   Inequitable services and uncertainty of shared water resources have
   caused a ``tragedy of the commons,{''} leading to growing disparity and
   a severely receding water table. This research proposes the Louis-Ostrom
   Comprehensive Capacity Assessment (LOCCA) tool-an integration of the
   quantitative Capacity Factors Analysis risk methodology and the
   qualitative Ostrom's framework for assessing socio-ecological systems
   (SESs). The new framework is used to provide a sample assessment of the
   Vaillapally habitation in Narayanpur Mandal, Nalgonda. Preliminary
   results indicate that the institutional, technical, and socio-cultural
   capacity factors must progress to meet the policymakers' current
   projects technical capacity. Alternatively, decentralized systems, such
   as rainwater harvesting technology, better serve rural areas with low
   capacity and demand, while increasing collective investment in

Title = {Scenario archetypes reveal risks and opportunities for global mountain
   futures},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {69},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Mountain social-ecological systems (MtSES) are transforming rapidly due
   to changes in multiple environmental and socioeconomic drivers. However,
   the complexity and diversity of MtSES present challenges for local
   communities, researchers and decision makers seeking to anticipate
   change and promote action towards sustainable MtSES. Participatory
   scenario planning can reveal potential futures and their interacting
   dynamics, while archetype analysis aggregates insights from site-based
   scenarios. We combined a systematic review of the global MtSES
   participatory scenarios literature and archetype analysis to identify
   emergent MtSES archetypal configurations. An initial sample of 1983
   rendered 42 articles that contained 142 scenarios within which were 852
   `futures states'. From these future states within the scenarios, we
   identified 59 desirable and undesirable futures that were common across
   studies. These `common futures' were grouped into four clusters that
   correlated significantly with three social-ecological factors (GDP per
   capita, income inequality, and mean annual temperature). Using these
   clusters and their associated significant factors, we derived four MtSES
   scenario archetypal configurations characterized by similar key
   adaptation strategies, assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. We called
   these archetypes: (1) ``revitalization through effective institutions
   and tourism{''}; (2) ``local innovations in smallholder farming and
   forestry{''}; (3) ``upland depopulation and increased risk of
   hazards{''}; and (4) ``regulated economic and ecological prosperity{''}.
   Results indicate risks to be mitigated, including biodiversity loss,
   ecosystem degradation, cultural heritage change, loss of connection to
   the land, weak leadership, market collapse, upland depopulation,
   increased landslides, avalanches, mudflows and rock falls, as well as
   climate variability and change. Transformative opportunities lie in
   adaptive biodiversity conservation, income diversification, adaptation
   to market fluxes, improving transport and irrigation infrastructure,
   high quality tourism and preserving traditional knowledge. Despite the
   uncertainties arising from global environmental changes, these
   archetypes support better targeting of evidence-informed actions across
   scales and sectors in MtSES.},

Title = {The Brisbane Declaration and Global Action Agenda on Environmental Flows
   (2018)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {A decade ago, scientists and practitioners working in environmental
   water management crystallized the progress and direction of
   environmental flows science, practice, and policy in The Brisbane
   Declaration and Global Action Agenda (2007), during the 10th
   International Riversymposium and International Environmental Flows
   Conference held in Brisbane, Australia. The 2007 Declaration highlights
   the significance of environmental water allocations for humans and
   freshwater-dependent ecosystems, and sets out a nine-point global action
   agenda. This was the first consensus document that bought together the
   diverse experiences across regions and disciplines, and was significant
   in setting a common vision and direction for environmental flows
   internationally. After a decade of uptake and innovation in
   environmental flows, the 2007 declaration and action agenda was
   revisited at the 20th International Riversymposium and Environmental
   Flows Conference, held in Brisbane, Australia, in 2017. The objective
   was to publicize achievements since 2007 and update the declaration and
   action agenda to reflect collective progress, innovation, and emerging
   challenges for environmental flows policy, practice and science
   worldwide. This paper on The Brisbane Declaration and Global Action
   Agenda on Environmental Flows (2018) describes the inclusive
   consultation processes that guided the review of the 2007 document. The
   2018 Declaration presents an urgent call for action to protect and
   restore environmental flows and aquatic ecosystems for their
   biodiversity, intrinsic values, and ecosystem services, as a central
   element of integrated water resources management, and as a foundation
   for achievement of water-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
   The Global Action Agenda (2018) makes 35 actionable recommendations to
   guide and support implementation of environmental flows through
   legislation and regulation, water management programs, and research,
   linked by partnership arrangements involving diverse stakeholders. An
   important new element of the Declaration and Action Agenda is the
   emphasis given to full and equal participation for people of all
   cultures, and respect for their rights, responsibilities and systems of
   governance in environmental water decisions. These social and cultural
   dimensions of e-flow management warrant far more attention. Actionable
   recommendations present a pathway forward for a new era of scientific
   research and innovation, shared visions, collaborative implementation
   programs, and adaptive governance of environmental flows, suited to new
   social, and environmental contexts driven by planetary pressures, such
   as human population growth and climate change.},

Title = {Hotspots of Agricultural Ecosystem Services and Farmland Biodiversity
   Overlap with Areas at Risk of Land Abandonment in Japan},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Agriculture provides a wide range of ecosystem services and has the
   potential to contribute to biodiversity conservation. In Japan, many of
   the resources associated with agroecosystems are threatened by farmland
   abandonment. Identifying where and to what extent agricultural ecosystem
   services and farmland biodiversity are affected by farmland abandonment
   is essential for developing effective strategies to counter the
   potential loss of these services and the biological communities that
   support them. Our study aimed to examine how a set of indicators for
   ecosystem services and biodiversity linked to agroecosystems
   (proportions of land dedicated to rice production and other agricultural
   production, proportion of agricultural land on slopes potentially
   providing landscape aesthetics, proportion of villages promoting rural
   tourism, and densities of forest edges and irrigation ponds in
   agricultural land) are distributed at the municipal level across the
   Japanese Archipelago, and to analyze their spatial patterns in relation
   to the distribution of farmland abandonment. It was hypothesized that
   hotspots of agricultural ecosystem services and farmland biodiversity
   occur in areas at risk of farmland abandonment owing to shared drivers.
   The cluster analysis identified four distinct ecosystem service bundle
   types, two of them representing areas specializing in agricultural
   production, while the other two provided high levels of cultural
   services and habitats for diverse biological communities. The latter two
   bundles were located in hilly and mountainous areas and accounted for
   58\% of rice production, 27\% of other agricultural production, 77\% of
   landscape aesthetics, 77\% of rural tourism, 64\% of forest edges, and
   87\% of irrigation ponds in Japan. In support of the hypothesis,
   farmland abandonment was pronounced in these areas, with 64\% of
   recently abandoned fields located where 44\% of agricultural land was
   found. This spatial overlap suggests that substantial losses of
   ecosystem services and biodiversity may occur if current patterns of
   farmland abandonment continue. In order to prevent large-scale losses of
   agricultural ecosystem services and farmland biodiversity, measures to
   counteract the ongoing abandonment trends should prioritize hilly and
   mountainous areas, and future studies should further evaluate the
   multiple functions of agricultural areas to improve policies that aim to
   ensure sustainable development of rural areas in Japan.},

Title = {Hydrological processing of salinity and nitrate in the Salinas Valley
   agricultural watershed},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {193},
Number = {SUPPL 1, 1, SI},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Regime shifts of major salinity constituents (Ca, Mg, Na, K, SO4, Cl,
   HCO3, and NO3) in the lower Salinas River, an agricultural ecosystem,
   can have major impacts on ecosystem services central to continued
   agricultural production in the region. Regime shifts are large,
   persistent, and often abrupt changes in the structure and dynamics of
   social-ecological systems that occur when there is a reorganization of
   the dominant feedbacks in the system. Monitoring information on changes
   in the system state, controlling variables, and feedbacks is a crucial
   contributor to applying sustainability and ecosystem resilience at an
   operational level. To better understand the factors driving salinization
   of the lower Salinas River on the central coast of California, we
   examined a 27-year record of concentrations of major salinity
   constituents in the river. Although limited in providing an
   understanding of solute flux behavior during storm events, long-term
   ``grab sampling{''} datasets with accompanying stream discharges can be
   used to estimate the actual history of concentrations and fluxes. We
   developed new concentration-discharge relationships to evaluate the
   dynamics of chemical weathering, hydrological processes, and
   agricultural practices in the watershed. Examinations of long-term
   records of surface water and groundwater salinity are required to
   provide both understanding and perspective towards managing salinity in
   arid and semi-arid regions while also enabling determination of the
   influence of external climatic variability and internal drivers in the
   system. We found that rock weathering is the main source of Ca, Mg, Na,
   HCO3, and SO4 in the river that further enables ion exchange between Ca,
   Mg, and Na. River concentrations of K, NO3, and Cl were associated with
   human activities while agricultural practices were the major source of K
   and NO3. A more direct anthropogenic positive trend in NO3 that has
   persisted since the mid-1990s is associated with the lag or memory
   effects of field cropping and use of flood irrigation. Event to
   inter-year scale patterns in the lower Salinas River salinity are
   further controlled by antecedent hydrologic conditions. This study
   underscores the importance of obtaining long-term monitoring records
   towards understanding watershed changes-of-state and time constants on
   the range of driving processes.},

   strengthen sustainable food production are urgent in highly unequal
   countries as Mexico. In Mexico City, the most populated city of the
   country, a wetland system, named Xochimilco, still holds chinampas, a
   unique and ingenious food system dating from pre-Hispanic times. These
   days chinampas are the best example of urban sustainable agriculture
   production. Unfortunately, this system is under threat due to
   urbanization and industrial land-use changes. Among the strategies to
   promote sustainable modes of production and consumption is eco or green
   labeling, consisting of a voluntary environmental certification
   approach, and marketing and advertising tool, that can change producers'
   and consumers' behavior toward long-term sustainability. Although widely
   used, the benefits of green labels for producers are not always
   realized. This study aimed to learn more about the agro-ecological
   production process and commercialization challenges in Xochimilco and
   San Gregorio Atlapulco in Southern Mexico City to understand chinampa
   producers' needs and determine whether a green label can offer solutions
   in this vulnerable socio-ecological system, particularly suffering the
   effects of the COVID-19 pandemics. For this, a literature review and
   producers' mental model analysis based on network theory, were
   developed. Results show that non-resolved issues such as
   commercialization problems, consumers' unwillingness to pay a fair
   price, loss of healthy soil, and degraded water quality used for
   irrigation persist and can affect the benefits of a green label
   including to improve chinampa production and farmers' income. Farmers'
   current necessities comprised increasing profits, receiving financial
   advice to set prices of agro-ecological vegetables and production costs,
   among others. Under the current production and commercialization
   scenarios complying with the assessment cost of certification will be
   difficult for most producers; then, implementing the green label would
   probably fail to fulfill the benefits. Attending to former and
   persistent conflicts and satisfying chinampa producers' neglected
   necessities are essential before implementing any program.},

Title = {Integrating social and ecological data to model metapopulation dynamics

Journal = {ECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {100},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Understanding how metapopulations persist in dynamic working landscapes
   requires assessing the behaviors of key actors that change patches as
   well as intrinsic factors driving turnover. Coupled human and natural
   systems (CHANS) research uses a multidisciplinary approach to identify
   the key actors, processes, and feedbacks that drive metapopulation and
   landscape dynamics. We describe a framework for modeling metapopulations
   in CHANS that integrates ecological and social data by coupling
   stochastic patch occupancy models of metapopulation dynamics with
   agent-based models of land-use change. We then apply this framework to
   metapopulations of the threatened black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis)
   and widespread Virginia rail (Rallus limicola) that inhabit patchy,
   irrigation-fed wetlands in the rangelands of the California Sierra
   Nevada foothills. We collected data from five diverse sources (rail
   occupancy surveys, land-use change mapping, a survey of landowner
   decision making, climate and reservoir databases, and mosquito trapping
   and West Nile virus testing) and integrated them into an agent-based
   stochastic patch occupancy model. We used the model to (1) quantify the
   drivers of metapopulation dynamics, and the potential interactions and
   feedbacks among them; (2) test predictions of the behavior of
   metapopulations in dynamic working landscapes; and (3) evaluate the
   impact of three policy options on metapopulation persistence (irrigation
   district water cutbacks during drought, incentives for landowners to
   create wetlands, and incentives for landowners to protect wetlands).
   Complex metapopulation dynamics emerged when landscapes functioned as
   CHANS, highlighting the importance of integrating human activities and
   other ecological processes into metapopulation models. Rail
   metapopulations were strongly top-down regulated by precipitation, and
   the black rail's decade-long decline was caused by the combination of
   West Nile virus and drought. Theoretical predictions of the two
   metapopulations' responses to dynamic landscapes and incentive programs
   were complicated by heterogeneity in patch quality and CHANS couplings,
   respectively. Irrigation cutbacks during drought posed a serious
   extinction risk that neither incentive policy effectively ameliorated.},

Abstract = {Population loss in rural areas is rapidly increasing in high-income
   countries, raising concerns and debate, given its socio-economic
   consequences. Despite the evident environmental dimension of the
   phenomenon, ecological knowledge has been neglected in the analysis of
   actions aiming to reverse rural depopulation. Particularly, cultural
   landscapes reflect memories of ecological processes that have configured
   current patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Based on
   ecological principles, we present a conceptual procedure to assess the
   behaviour of social-ecological systems subjected to depopulation,
   projecting their expected trajectories through time within a framework
   defined jointly by demographic and environmental-ecological dimensions
   (in our case, biodiversity, carbon storage, pollution control, water
   resources and soil conservation). We applied this procedure to various
   alternative interventions designed to confront depopulation in Spain:
   (1) non-intervention, (2) maintenance of the historical landscape
   configuration, (3) active conservation, (4) extensive, sustainable land
   use and (5) intensified land use. We conclude that extensive,
   sustainable land use better optimizes criteria of demographic
   consolidation, environmental impact, resilience and implementation of
   actions confronting depopulation. We highlight the need to incorporate
   ecological knowledge into the assessment and application of actions
   confronting rural depopulation.Read the free Plain Language Summary for

   La perdida de poblacion en zonas rurales es una tendencia en rapido
   aumento en paises de ingresos elevados, lo que genera preocupacion y
   debate, dadas sus consecuencias socioeconomicas. Los paisajes culturales
   reflejan la memoria de procesos ecologicos que han configurado la
   situacion actual de la biodiversidad y de los servicios ecosistemicos.
   Pero a pesar de su evidente dimension ambiental, el analisis de las
   acciones destinadas a revertir la despoblacion rural apenas ha
   considerado el conocimiento ecologico del que disponemos para estos
   sistemas. Basandonos en principios ecologicos, presentamos un
   procedimiento conceptual para evaluar el comportamiento de sistemas
   socio-ecologicos sometidos a despoblacion, proyectando sus trayectorias
   temporales esperadas en un espacio definido por dimensiones demograficas
   y ambiental-ecologicas (en nuestro caso, biodiversidad, almacenamiento
   de carbono, control de la contaminacion, recursos hidricos, conservacion
   del suelo). Este procedimiento se ha aplicado a varias alternativas de
   gestion del territorio, disenadas para afrontar la despoblacion en
   Espana: (1) no intervencion, (2) mantenimiento de la configuracion
   paisajistica historica, (3) conservacion activa, (4) uso extensivo y
   sostenible del territorio, (5) uso intensificado del territorio.
   Concluimos que el uso extensivo y sostenible del territorio optimiza
   mejor los criterios de consolidacion demografica, impacto ambiental,
   resiliencia e implementacion de acciones frente a la despoblacion.
   Destacamos la necesidad de incorporar el conocimiento ecologico en la
   evaluacion y aplicacion de acciones frente a la despoblacion rural.

Title = {The role of reserves and anthropogenic habitats for functional

Volume = {24},
Number = {7},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Ecological reserves provide important wildlife habitat in many
   landscapes, and the functional connectivity of reserves and other
   suitable habitat patches is crucial for the persistence and resilience
   of spatially structured populations. To maintain or increase
   connectivity at spatial scales larger than individual patches,
   conservation actions may focus on creating and maintaining reserves
   and/or influencing management on non-reserves. Using a graph-theoretic
   approach, we assessed the functional connectivity and spatial
   distribution of wetlands in the Rainwater Basin of Nebraska, USA, an
   intensively cultivated agricultural matrix, at four assumed, but
   ecologically realistic, anuran dispersal distances. We compared
   connectivity in the current landscape to the historical landscape and
   putative future landscapes, and evaluated the importance of individual
   and aggregated reserve and non-reserve wetlands for maintaining
   connectivity. Connectivity was greatest in the historical landscape,
   where wetlands were also the most densely distributed. The construction
   of irrigation reuse pits for water storage has maintained connectivity
   in the current landscape by replacing destroyed wetlands, but these pits
   likely provide suboptimal habitat. Also, because there are fewer total
   wetlands (i.e., wetlands and irrigation reuse pits) in the current
   landscape than the historical landscape, and because the distribution of
   current wetlands is less clustered than that of historical wetlands,
   larger and longer dispersing, sometimes nonnative species may be favored
   over smaller, shorter dispersing species of conservation concern.
   Because of their relatively low number, wetland reserves do not affect
   connectivity as greatly as non-reserve wetlands or irrigation reuse
   pits; however, they likely provide the highest quality anuran habitat.
   To improve future levels of resilience in this wetland habitat network,
   management could focus on continuing to improve the conservation status
   of non-reserve wetlands, restoring wetlands at spatial scales that
   promote movements of shorter dispersing species, and further
   scrutinizing irrigation reuse pit removal by considering effects on
   functional connectivity for anurans, an emblematic and threatened group
   of organisms. However, broader conservation plans will need to give
   consideration to other wetland-dependent species, incorporate invasive
   species management, and address additional challenges arising from
   global change in social-ecological systems like the Rainwater Basin.},

Title = {Markets and misfits in adaptive water governance: how agricultural
   markets shape water conflict and cooperation},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Agricultural trade poses dilemmas for adaptive water governance as
   farmers and irrigation systems become integrated into global food value
   chains and are affected by their ongoing dynamics. The benefits and
   risks of agricultural trade and agrarian transitions are unevenly
   distributed, giving rise to complex interdependencies and externalities.
   Despite these growing linkages, the understanding of agricultural
   markets and their influence on water conflict and cooperation remains
   limited and dependent on context, which can lead to seemingly
   contradictory evidence. Progress has been hampered by boundary problems,
   disputed concepts, measurement issues, and divergent normative
   perspectives. Addressing these challenges will require that water
   governance scholars account more explicitly for agricultural trade when
   diagnosing collective action problems and assessing different modes of
   adaptive water governance. Drawing on the common-pool resource
   governance literature, we distinguish three separate, but interrelated,
   conceptual perspectives examining agricultural trade as an external
   factor in water governance: (1) market integration as a disturbance, (2)
   market integration as an opportunity, and (3) agricultural trade as a
   form of telecoupling with nested externalities. We compare these
   perspectives in terms of the externalities involved, their major claims
   about the relationship between market integration and collective action
   in the context of irrigation governance, and the broader implications
   for adaptive water governance. The comparison demonstrates the
   prevalence of institutional misfits and the common struggle of boundary
   shifting, i.e., matching water governance to the expanding problem-shed
   associated with agricultural markets. Institutional fit offers one
   important lens through which to consider the shifting boundaries (and
   actors) relevant for water governance, the scope and limits for
   strengthening fit through social learning, and the importance of nested
   governance to address nested externalities. These insights point the way
   for an agenda of research that examines the evolution of agricultural
   trade and adaptive water governance and pays explicit attention to the
   politics and power relations that shape who wins and loses and the
   different levers and entry points to improve management of the
   associated transitions and trade-offs. We conclude by arguing that
   future research should identify and examine pathways of adaptive water
   governance that strengthen processes of social learning and
   institutional nesting to address the external pressures and
   opportunities created by global food value chains.},

Title = {Institutional Dynamics Impact the Response of Urban Socio-Hydrologic
   Systems to Supply Challenges},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Designing urban water systems to respond to the accelerating and
   unpredictable changes of the Anthropocene will require changes not only
   to built infrastructure and operating rules, but also to the governance
   arrangements responsible for investing in them. Yet, inclusion of this
   political-economic feedback in dynamic models of infrastructure systems
   and socio-hydrology has lagged behind operational feedback concerns. We
   address this gap through a dynamical systems application of the Coupled
   Infrastructure Systems (CIS) Framework, which provides the conceptual
   building blocks for analyzing social-ecological systems through various
   classes of infrastructure and the flows of material and information
   among them. In the model, political-economic feedback involves three
   decisions-infrastructure investment, rate-setting, and short-term demand
   curtailment-and each decision is constrained by institutional friction,
   the aggregation of decision and transaction costs associated with taking
   action. We apply the model to three cities in the Phoenix Metropolitan
   Area to compare how institutional friction interacts with a city's water
   resource portfolio and financial position to determine its sensitivity,
   or the degree to which its performance (e.g., providing sufficient
   supply to meet demand) changes given reductions in Colorado River water
   availability. We find that the slowing effect of institutional friction
   on investment and rate-setting decisions can increase the sensitivity of
   a city's supply, but it can also promote objectives that compete with
   over-response (e.g., rate burden). The effect is dependent on the
   initial operating capacity of the CIS and flexibility within the
   institutions, highlighting the need to consider political-economic and
   operational feedback together when evaluating infrastructure systems.
   Urban water systems must grapple with accelerating social and
   environmental change that requires them to not only consider future
   infrastructure needs, but also, the configuration of decisions
   responsible for infrastructure investment. Unfortunately, inclusion of
   political-economic feedback has lagged behind operational feedback in
   models that examine water systems response to changing environments. We
   present a modeling approach to trace the flow of water, information, and
   investment in a general urban water system that must make three annual
   decisions: infrastructure investment, rate-setting, and short-term
   demand curtailment. Each decision is influenced by costs to taking
   action and the flexibility involved in setting action magnitudes. We
   apply the model to three cities in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area to
   compare how these institutional constraints interact with existing
   infrastructure and finances to affect their sensitivity, or the degree
   to which their performance (e.g., providing sufficient supply to meet
   demand) changes given reductions in Colorado River water. We find that
   when institutional barriers to action increase, cities are more
   sensitive to supply shocks, but such barriers can benefit other
   objectives like rate burden. The effect is dependent on the presence of
   redundant supplies, demand growth, and decision-making flexibility,
   highlighting the need to consider both political-economic and
   operational concerns when evaluating water systems.
   Having sufficient supply redundancy can outweigh the negative effect of
   slow institutions on a city's ability to address supply shocks The
   supplies of cities with institutions that require more stress to act are
   more sensitive to shocks, but their rates are less sensitive Adding
   flexibility to institutions can ease the burden of large investments on
   ratepayers and improve the reliability of slow institutions},

Title = {Climate variability in agroecosystems: A quantitative assessment of
   stakeholder-defined policies for enhanced socio-ecological resilience},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {201},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {CONTEXT: The development of methods for improving the assessment of
   resilience of socio-ecological systems has become increasingly important
   as the severity and variability of global climate patterns continue to
   compound and intensify.OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted with
   the aim of using a dynamically-coupled bio-physical and socioeconomic
   model to test the efficacy of stakeholder-defined policy measures in
   conferring resilience to two agroecological variables, farm income and
   water-table depth, experiencing both socio-ecological shocks and
   climatic stress in the Rechna Doab basin of northeastern
   Pakistan.METHODS: The objective was accomplished by using a
   dynamically-coupled physical and group-built system dynamics modelling
   framework for scenario testing and output generation, including three
   NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Climate Projections
   (NEX-DGGP), two relevant socio-ecological shock scenarios (market
   inflation and canal water supply variability), and three
   stakeholder-defined policy measures. Resilience was assessed using the
   following system functionality metrics: 1) The degree of return for each
   variable after a perturbation, i.e., the extent to which the observed
   variable returns to baseline functioning; 2) The return time of the
   variable to baseline functioning; 3) The rate of variable return to
   baseline; 4) Overall perturbation of the system post-disturbance; and 5)
   The corrective impact of the shock on system functionality. Differences
   in the resilience metrics were subsequently compared based on the
   behavioral change(s) of the study variables in response to the
   application of the three selected policy scenarios.RESULTS AND
   CONCLUSIONS: The results presented here indicate that rainwater
   harvesting is the most effective stakeholder-defined policy measure for
   improving or maintaining resilience of the tested study variables in the
   Rechna Doab agricultural basin; this holds true for every climate and
   shock scenario with the exception of water table depth in the upper and
   mid-watershed regions under canal supply shock conditions, for which
   canal lining is the most effective policy measure. The irrigation
   improvement and canal lining policies were more effective in improving
   the resilience metrics of water-table depth than those of the farm
   income variable, as the water-table depth variable is not bound so
   tightly by economic constraints; although there were regional
   differences in policy efficacy, these trends hold true, on average, for
   the entire watershed. The results presented herein align well with
   previous studies conducted in the region which note similar patterns in
   spatial resilience of agroecosystem variables (i.e., upper to lower
   watershed) in the Recha Doab basin as well as regional differences in
   the efficacy of the stakeholder-defined policy measures. SIGNIFICANCE:
   This unique approach for assessing socio-environmental policies can help
   improve decision making processes with respect to agro-infrastructure
   and climate change mitigation strategies in vulnerable agroecosystems.},
