Abstract = {Conservation and development visions in and around protected areas
   generate confrontation and uncertainty that damage the biodiversity and
   ecosystem services which maintain human well-being. To address this
   issue, we applied the participatory scenario planning framework to the
   protected area of the Do ana social-ecological system in southwestern
   Spain. This work explores the social perceptions regarding the
   conditions, trends, trade-offs, and future of ecosystem services and
   human well-being, and seeks management strategies for the Do ana
   social-ecological system and its protected areas. We found that
   participatory scenario planning (1) can create different visions of the
   future of the system addressing its uncertainty and the main ecosystem
   services trade-offs, and (2) can propose consensual management
   strategies to determine a path toward a desirable future.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {This paper presents results from the MayaSim model, an integrated
   agent-based, cellular automata, and network model representing the
   ancient Maya social-ecological system. The model represents the
   relationship between population growth, agricultural production, soil
   degradation, climate variability, primary productivity, hydrology,
   ecosystem services, forest succession, and the stability of trade
   networks. Agents representing settlements develop and expand within a
   spatial landscape that changes under climate variation and responds to
   anthropogenic impacts. The model is able to reproduce spatial patterns
   and timelines somewhat analogous to that of the ancient Maya, although
   this proof-of-concept model requires refinement and further
   archaeological data for calibration. This paper aims to identify
   candidate features of a resilient versus vulnerable social-ecological
   system, and employs computer simulation to explore this topic, using the
   ancient Maya as an example. Complex systems modelling identifies how
   interconnected variables behave, considering fast-moving variables such
   as land cover change and trade connections, meso-speed variables such as
   demographics and climate variability, as well as slow-moving variables
   such as soil degradation.},

Title = {Putting the ``E{''} in SES: unpacking the ecology in the Ostrom
   social-ecological system framework},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The Ostrom social-ecological system (SES) framework offers an
   interdisciplinary tool for studies of linked human-natural systems.
   However, its origin in the social sciences belies the effectiveness of
   its interdisciplinary ambitions and undermines its ability to cope with
   ecological complexity. To narrow the gap between inherently dynamic
   ecological systems and the SES framework, we need to explicitly
   recognize that SES outcomes are coproduced by social systems in which
   choices are made, as well as an ecological system with a diverse
   assortment of dynamic natural processes that mediate the effect of those
   choices. We illustrate the need for more explicit incorporation of
   ecological attributes into the SES framework by presenting a case study
   of a community-managed forest in Indiana, USA. A preliminary set of
   ecological attributes are also proposed for inclusion in the SES
   framework with the aim of spurring interest in further development of a
   truly interdisciplinary framework for the study of SESs.},

Title = {Explaining planted-tree survival and growth in urban neighborhoods: A
   social-ecological approach to studying recently-planted trees in
   Indianapolis},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {136},
Pages = {130-143},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This research seeks to answer the question, what factors of the urban
   social-ecological system predict survival and growth of trees in
   nonprofit and neighborhood tree-planting projects? The Ostrom
   social-ecological system framework and Clark and colleagues' model of
   urban forest sustainability inform our selection of variables in four
   categories in the social-ecological system; these categories are the
   trees, the biophysical environment, the community, and management
   institutions. We use tree inventory methods to collect data on the
   survival, growth, and the social-ecological growing environment of
   recently-planted street trees in Indianapolis, IN to answer our research
   question. We use a probit model to predict tree survival, and a linear
   regression model to predict tree growth rate. The following variables
   are positively related to tree success (survival and/or growth):
   ball-and-burlap or container packaging, a visible root flare, good
   overall condition rating, the size of the tree-planting project,
   planting area width, median household income, percent of renter occupied
   homes, resident tenure, prior tree planting experience, correct
   mulching, and a collective watering strategy. The following variables
   are negatively related to tree success: caliper at planting, crown
   dieback, and lower trunk damage. Additional variables measured have less
   clear connections to tree success and should be examined further. Given
   that models including variables from all four categories of the
   social-ecological system generally outperform models that exclude some
   components, we recommend that future research on urban tree survival and
   growth should consider the holistic social-ecological systems context of
   the urban ecosystem. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {To What Extent Does Indigenous Local Knowledge Support the
   Social-Ecological System? A Case Study of the Ammatoa Community,
   Indonesia},
Journal = {RESOURCES-BASEL},

Abstract = {Recognition of multiple knowledge systems is essential to facilitate
   collaboration and mutual learning between different actors, integration
   across social and ecological systems, and sustainable development goals.
   This study aims to identify how local knowledge from the indigenous
   people in developing countries contributes toward supporting the
   social-ecological system. We use a case study of the Ammatoa community,
   one of the indigenous communities in South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia.
   This study shows how their social and ecological practices are combined
   to develop their customary area and how the Ammatoa's customary values
   contribute towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 15 and
   12 of the United Nations, i.e., leveraging local resources for
   livelihood and ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns.
   Examples of practices elaborated in this paper are protecting,
   restoring, and promoting sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems,
   sustainably managing forests, combating desertification, halting and
   reversing land degradation, halting biodiversity loss, and ensuring
   sustainable consumption and production patterns. Furthermore, the
   Ammatoa's customary values form a sustainable system that not only
   affects their social aspects, but also their economy and surrounding
   environment. This research can be used to develop relevant
   environmental-related interventions related to SDGs 15 and 12 from
   indigenous peoples' perspectives.},

Abstract = {This study proposes and empirically tests a framework that integrates
   the concepts of community resilience and social-ecological system (SES)
   resilience through community forestry case studies. The framework
   provides a possible approach for assessing community resilience based on
   the development and allocation of socio-cultural, economic, and natural
   capital of individual households within a given forest community.
   Furthermore, aspects of SES resilience and system dynamics are used to
   define the potential state thresholds of community resilience. This
   exploratory attempt to quantify community resilience, using the proposed
   framework, aims to advance understanding of the conceptual overlaps of
   SES and community resilience as applied to forestry management. We
   consider community forestry groups as SES examples in which the
   community is an important stakeholder in managing natural forest
   capital. We selected pioneer communities under the community-based
   forest management (CBFM) Program in the Philippines as our case studies.
   We found that, on average, CBFM group members demonstrated moderate
   levels of resilience according to their acquired levels of capital.
   Although economic capital remained the weakest capital, the CBFM program
   had a positive effect in increasing the socio-cultural and natural
   capital of an entire community.},

   Sequestration Capacity-An Analysis Based on the Social-Ecological System
   Framework},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Against the backdrop of industrialization, urbanization, and the
   increasingly urgent issue of climate change, the latest round of
   collective forest tenure reform in China demonstrates the
   characteristics of institutional change and capital-biased technological
   progress. Using provincial panel data from 1994 to 2015, which is
   related to the main task of the reform, this study combined the
   Social-Ecological System (SES) framework to explore the impact of the
   latest round of collective forest tenure reform on forest carbon
   sequestration capacity. The study found that (1) the collective forest
   tenure reform enhances forest carbon sequestration capacity, especially
   in areas with abundant collective forests and clear property rights.
   Regional differences in per capita forestry income do not affect the
   reform's impact on this capacity; (2) the forest tenure reform affects
   carbon sequestration capacity by improving capital productivity, but
   labor productivity has no significant effect; (3) under the macro
   background, the interaction between forest tenure reform-supporting
   measures and factor productivity have a sustainable impact on carbon
   sequestration capacity. Therefore, deepening the collective forest
   tenure reform is an important measure for continuously improving the
   carbon sequestration capacity of collective forests.},

   communities: Case of Hani rice terrace social-ecological system in
   Southwest China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {106},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Leadership and social networks substantially influence the collective
   actions in rural communities. It is important to understand how village
   elites influence villagers through social networks and facilitate
   collective actions, especially for indigenous communities. This paper
   takes the rice terrace social-ecological system (SES) of the Hani ethnic
   minority in China as a case and adopts a mixed methodology to explore
   the diversified roles of various types of village elites in the
   collective actions of managing four social-ecological sub-systems:
   forests, villages, terraces, and water. Results reveal that
   institutional and non-institutional elites play different roles in
   coordinating the collective actions of managing four sub-systems. Social
   network analysis shows that village elites have high degree centrality
   and play bridging roles between different sub-groups, but differences
   exist between the network patterns of managing forests and water and
   managing villages and terraces. Contagion models show that both
   friendship and advice networks contribute to the social influence among
   villagers, but advice networks have larger influences in managing
   villages, terraces, and water than friendship networks. This study
   provides insights into the heterogeneity and dynamics of village
   leadership and social networks in managing rural SESs that are
   experiencing rapid socio-economic changes, and the results contribute to
   making integrative and adaptive planning and development policies for
   indigenous communities.},

Title = {A data-driven methodological routine to identify key indicators for
   social-ecological system archetype mapping},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The spatial mapping of social-ecological system (SES) archetypes
   constitutes a fundamental tool to operationalize the SES concept in
   empirical research. Approaches to detect, map, and characterize SES
   archetypes have evolved over the last decade towards more integrative
   and comparable perspectives guided by SES conceptual frameworks and
   reference lists of variables. However, hardly any studies have
   investigated how to empirically identify the most relevant set of
   indicators to map the diversity of SESs. In this study, we propose a
   data-driven methodological routine based on multivariate statistical
   analysis to identify the most relevant indicators for mapping and
   characterizing SES archetypes in a particular region. Taking Andalusia
   (Spain) as a case study, we applied this methodological routine to 86
   indicators representing multiple variables and dimensions of the SES.
   Additionally, we assessed how the empirical relevance of these
   indicators contributes to previous expert and empirical knowledge on key
   variables for characterizing SESs. We identified 29 key indicators that
   allowed us to map 15 SES archetypes encompassing natural, mosaic,
   agricultural, and urban systems, which uncovered contrasting land
   sharing and land sparing patterns throughout the territory. We found
   synergies but also disagreements between empirical and expert knowledge
   on the relevance of variables: agreement on their widespread relevance
   (32.7\% of the variables, e.g. crop and livestock production, net
   primary productivity, population density); relevance conditioned by the
   context or the scale (16.3\%, e.g. land protection, educational level);
   lack of agreement (20.4\%, e.g. economic level, land tenure); need of
   further assessments due to the lack of expert or empirical knowledge
   (30.6\%). Overall, our data-driven approach can contribute to more
   objective selection of relevant indicators for SES mapping, which may
   help to produce comparable and generalizable empirical knowledge on key
   variables for characterizing SESs, as well as to derive more
   representative descriptions and causal factor configurations in SES
   archetype analysis.},

Journal = {LAND},

Abstract = {A healthy park-people relationship depends essentially on the fair and
   sustainable maintenance of rural livelihood. When a protected area is
   designated, rural people may face restrictions on access to land and
   resource use. In Wuyishan of China, we analyzed the role of traditional
   tea cultivation during consistent protected area management to find ways
   to maintain the stability of this social-ecological system in the new
   national park era. Based on the social-ecological system meaning
   perception, we used an intensive social survey to investigate residents'
   perception of the ecosystem in terms of tea cultivation and its
   interaction with conservation policies. Results showed that tea
   cultivation brought major household income and was associated with
   multiple cultural services. Protected area management affected land use,
   and conservation outcomes were more obvious to farmers than economic and
   social ones. We argue that the multi-functionality of the forest-tea
   system has the potential to benefit both the local people and the public
   through conservation-compatible activities at three levels: to regulate
   biophysical elements in the land plot, to link production and market at
   the mountain level, and to secure tenure and encourage community
   participation at the landscape level. This knowledge co-production
   approach revealed that to avoid a negative park-people relationship,
   traditional knowledge and people's right to benefit must be respected.},

Title = {Maintaining biodiversity promotes the multifunctionality of
   social-ecological systems: holistic modelling of a mountain system},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {47},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Monitoring the provision of multiple ecosystem services (ES) in
   social-ecological systems is a major challenge. Most tools usually
   tackle the problem by modelling individual ES, but do not perform a
   holistic analysis of a dynamic and integrated system. We developed a
   discrete-event model (DORIAN) and explored its potential for assessing
   biodiversity and multifunctionality of a mountain ski resort subjected
   to a changing climate. We represented this social-ecological system as a
   network comprising 16 binary components and 51 processes that define
   component interactions. We identified 22 economy- and ecology-related
   ES, depending on the presence/absence of components. We simulated six
   scenarios representing different economic, environmental and climatic
   situations and calculated a score (the sum of proxies for biodiversity
   or ES), corresponding to the level of biodiversity and
   multifunctionality. Results showed that climate change reduced the
   system's multifunctionality and increased the number of degraded states,
   as well as the trajectories from healthy to degraded states. With
   increasing levels of biodiversity, only ecology-related ES were boosted
   at low biodiversity levels, while both high levels of ecology- and
   economy-related ES were maintained at high biodiversity levels. This
   result demonstrates the importance of conserving high biodiversity in a
   social ecological system, for an optimal ``biodiversity -
   multifunctionality{''} win-win strategy.},

Title = {A balancing act: Principles, criteria and indicator framework to
   operationalize social-ecological resilience of forests},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Against a background of intensifying climate-induced disturbances, the
   need to enhance the resilience of forests and forest management is
   gaining urgency. In forest management, multiple trade-offs exist between
   different demands as well as across and within temporal and spatial
   scales. However, methods to assess resilience that consider these
   trade-offs are presently lacking. Here we propose a hierarchical
   framework of principles, criteria, and indicators to assess the
   resilience of a social-ecological system by focusing on the mechanisms
   behind resilience. This hierarchical framework balances trade-offs
   between mechanisms, different parts of the social-ecological system,
   ecosystem services, and spatial as well as temporal scales. The
   framework was developed to be used in a participatory manner in forest
   management planning. It accounts for the major parts of the
   forest-related social-ecological system and considers the multiple
   trade-offs involved. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by
   applying it to a landscape dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.)
   Karst.) in Central Europe, managed for three different management goals.
   The framework highlights how forest resilience varies with the pursued
   management goals and related management strategies. The framework is
   flexible and can be applied to various forest management contexts as
   part of a participatory process with stakeholders. It thus is an
   important step towards operationalizing social-ecological resilience in
   forest management systems.},

Abstract = {We analysed the changes that had taken place in the last 45 years in the
   spatial structure of the landscape, in the demographic tendencies of the
   local population and in the socioeconomic structure, in order to
   describe the current state and possible evolution of the
   social-ecological system in a mountain rural landscape in northern
   Spain. We conducted a series of interviews-questionnaires with the local
   population, which enabled us to define their profile and to evaluate
   their perception of the landscape and changes therein, thus establishing
   trends of territorial development and integrating history, culture,
   technology and environmental parameters, under different management
   perspectives. We observed a change in the spatial configuration of the
   landscape and modification of the territory, associated with rural
   abandonment, all of which gives rise to tensions among the components of
   the social-ecological system. The recovery and continuity in time of
   this system would be more viable under certain patterns of adaptive
   management and with the active participation of the local population in
   the decision-taking process, aimed at maintaining the (historic)
   landscape, which is characterised by its persistence and presents
   acceptable levels of biological and spatial diversity and productivity.
   This landscape would, in turn, maintain the development of tourism, one
   of the current pillars of the local economy, as it creates great demand
   for rural, natural and cultural tourism. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {42},

Abstract = {This paper applies a social-ecological system (SES) framework to the
   analysis of a SES in the Taos valley of northern New Mexico. The SES
   analyzed is a set of interconnected irrigation communities known as
   acequias. These have persisted in the area for several hundred years. In
   this paper I combine concepts from multi-level governance, social
   network analysis, and interconnected action situations to diagnose the
   factors that have enabled the acequias to maintain the levels of
   cooperation needed to persist as farming communities in a high desert
   environment. To conduct this research, interview data were collected
   on-site to complement existing court testimonies and other relevant
   primary and secondary data. These data were analyzed via a step-wise
   diagnostic process that is inspired by the SES framework and used to
   illustrate how the acequias form a multilevel governance system via key
   network attributes, and how this governance structure maps onto the
   resource system while not overburdening the participants and providing
   sufficient benefits to motivate continued cooperation over time.},

Pages = {223-234},
Abstract = {Vulnerability is one of the prominent features of rural areas due to
   their distinctive characteristics, such as remoteness, geographical
   conditions, and socio-economic dependence on primary sectors. Addressing
   the vulnerability of rural areas in terms of the rural development
   paradigm is both urgent and relevant. This study aims to address this
   issue using the current state-of-the-art machine learning method, using
   the socio-ecological framework and integrated vulnerability index of
   villages in Lampung Province in Indonesia. The study attempts to predict
   and classify villages' vulnerability to be applied for better planning
   and rural development. Based on random forest classification and
   decision tree algorithm, the results show that the village governance
   system represented by rural water management and the level of education
   of village leaders are suitable prediction variables related to the low
   vulnerability index. This study can draw lessons learned to improve
   rural development in developing countries. (c) 2022 by the authors;

Abstract = {We introduce a conceptual model of the urban forest patch as a complex

   developed this model through an interdisciplinary process engaging
   social and ecological scientists and urban land management decision
   makers, with a focus on temperate forest social-ecological systems. In
   this paper, we place the production and management of urban forest
   patches in historical perspective, present a conceptual model of urban
   forest patches within a broader regional context, and identify a series
   of research questions to highlight future directions for research on
   urban forest patches. This conceptual model identifies how spatial and
   temporal social-ecological drivers interact with patch-level conditions
   at multiple scales. Our integrative approach can provide insights into
   the role of social-ecological drivers in shaping forest health,
   biodiversity, and benefits forest patches provide to people in urban and
   urbanizing regions, with direct implications for decision-making to

Title = {Patrimony for Resilience: Evidence from the Forest Agdal in the Moroccan
   High Atlas Mountains},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Patrimony and resilience appear today as key concepts for understanding
   the dynamics of systems confronted with natural hazards. Nevertheless,
   the theoretical comparison between these concepts drawn from different
   epistemic approaches is lacking. Our aim is to interrelate resilience
   and patrimony concepts on the basis of a real example: the Agdal, a
   traditional forest management system in the Moroccan High Atlas. The
   role played by the Agdal in safeguarding the patterns of forest resource
   use by village communities from both external and internal conflicts,
   from natural hazards, and by securing a long-term supply of resource
   diversity is highlighted. This role shows the patrimonial character of
   the forest Agdal for the village communities and suggests an adaptive
   perspective. The patrimonial construction of the forest gives rise to
   management systems that allow a major place to experience social and
   environmental feedback, contributing to strengthened social-ecological
   system resilience and adaptability in the High Atlas Mountains. The
   notion of patrimony as a tool of resilience opens up a new
   interdisciplinary line of research.},

Abstract = {Resilience thinking has strongly influenced how people understand and
   pursue sustainability of linked social-ecological systems. Resilience
   thinking highlights the need to build capacity and manage general system
   properties in a complex, constantly changing world. I modified an
   analytical framework to address associations among cross-scale and
   cross-level dynamics, attributes of governance, and capacity to enhance
   resilience. The Danungdafu Forestation Area represents one of Taiwan's
   most controvisal cases concerning land use, indigenous rights, and
   environmental issues. Analysis of this Taiwanese experience from a
   social-ecological perspective can show how current capacities for
   managing resilience are related to critical governance attributes.
   Analysis helped identify fundamental flaws in current governance and key
   issues needing to be addressed. The Danungdafu Forestation Area should
   transition towards a governance regime that is more participatory,
   deliberative, multi-layered, accountable, just, and networked. This can
   be done by developing an intermediate level institution that coordinates
   the cross-scale and cross-level interactions that better fit this
   social-ecological system.},

Title = {Integrating social-ecological system into watershed ecosystem services
   management: A case study of the Jialing River Basin, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {160},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A severe decline in ecosystem services (ES) has accompanied the rapid
   development of human societies. There is a growing interest in
   considering ES management from a systemic and integrated perspective.
   Yet, researchers still need to explore effective ways to integrate human
   and natural systems for strengthening ES. This study proposes an
   integrating framework that connects the concept of social-ecological
   system (SES) with ES. We utilize land use types as indicators of basic
   SES structure and employ the InVEST model to evaluate typical ES in the
   Jialing River Basin (JRB). By analyzing spatial and temporal
   characteristics of SES and multiple typical ES, we investigate how ES is
   related to different SES types. The results reveal that: (1) from 1980
   to 2020, the SES of the JRB underwent significant transformations,
   including a decrease in cropland areas, while construction land and
   forestland areas increased. Especially, construction land SES
   experienced an increase as high as 212.53\%. (2) Regarding ES, water
   yield (WY) increased while soil conservation (SC), carbon storage (CS),
   and habitat quality (HQ) decreased. (3) The relationship analysis
   demonstrated disparities in levels of ES across various SES types.
   Construction land SES exhibited the highest average WY but lower SC, CS,
   and HQ values compared to forestland which had higher average SC, CS,
   and HQ instead. These findings imply that regional ES will be positively
   or negatively affected by transformation within SES. In the long run, it
   is crucial to synthesize both the characteristics of SES and functional
   benefits provided by ES in the JRB, then control the favorable
   transformations within SES to enhance a sustainable supply of ES. This
   study provides a novel methodology for connecting SES and ES
   comprehensively with new perspectives that will be beneficial for
   building regional SES management and ES enhancement.},

Title = {Potential Futures for Coastal Wolves and Their Ecosystem Services in
   Alaska, With Implications for Management of a Social-Ecological System},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {Carnivores across much of the world are declining, leading to loss of
   biodiversity as well as the ecosystem services carnivores provide. In
   2020, the Alexander Archipelago (AA) wolf was petitioned for protection
   under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) for the third time in 30
   years. Concerns included habitat alteration from industrial timber
   harvest and subsequent declines in prey (deer), human-caused mortality,
   climate change, and genetic inbreeding. However, the underlying
   biogeography and ecology of these wolves continues to suggest resiliency
   across the subspecies' range, even though local populations may go
   extinct. If local wolf populations go extinct, it will result in loss of
   their ecosystem services (e.g., interactions of wolves with their prey,
   which prevents over-browsing and protects carbon sequestration in soils
   and trees), which will likely have major consequences for the local
   social-ecological system. Here, we updated a model we constructed for
   the last ESA listing process (2015) to examine the dynamics of wolf and
   deer populations on Prince of Wales Island (the primary geographic focus
   of all three petitions) in response to future environmental and
   management scenarios developed with stakeholders. Further, we considered
   how changes in deer abundance impact predation services (prevention of
   over-browsing by deer). We found that wolf populations generally
   persisted over 30 years, but dropped below an effective population size
   of 50 wolves in 10-98\% of years simulated. Low wolf abundance resulted
   in higher deer abundance, which increased hunting opportunity, but also
   browsing damages (e.g., 19\% of areas would be over-browsed if wolf
   harvest caps are removed, and >30\% of areas would be over-browsed if
   wolves go extinct). Human harvest of wildlife was a key regulator of
   abundance and ecosystem services within the coastal rainforest
   social-ecological system; wolf abundance was most affected by wolf
   harvest regulations; and deer harvest restrictions increased wolf and
   deer abundances, but also greatly increased browsing impacts (>70\% of
   areas heavily browsed if hunting ceased). Our findings support an
   integrated approach to management of this social-ecological system, such
   that social and ecological sciences are both used to monitor important
   components of the system (e.g., measuring public sentiment and
   likelihood of poaching, alongside wolf and deer numbers). Integration
   and adaptive approaches are needed to ensure that the many ecosystem
   services humans depend on are valued, conserved, and restored, including
   the cryptic predation services wolves have historically provided to the
   timber industry via reduced browsing pressure by deer.},

Abstract = {This research examines how the Kandozi indigenous group governs access
   to fish and timber for sale and evaluates their perceptions of
   sustainability of those natural resources. The Kandozi occupy a
   biodiverse tropical forest in the northern Peruvian Amazon with lakes
   and seasonally flooded areas. Qualitative methods and a comparative
   examination of access to resources were used to explore current
   processes that shape access and the people's perceptions of their
   benefit from natural resources. Results indicated that environmental
   heterogeneity, kinship, land tenure, the legal framework, and knowledge
   all shaped access with some differences due to the dissimilar natures of
   fish and timber. This research concludes that the sustainability of this
   and similar systems are dependent upon the moment at which the analysis
   is done, because of the changing needs of people over time, in addition
   to changes in external factors and the natural variations that occur in
   the resources used. The range of relations and interactions among
   different processes that shape access, and the historically contingent
   characteristic of access and its evolution over time, help better
   understand the complexity of a given social-ecological system.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Ecosystem services (ESs) provide a bridge between social systems and
   ecosystems. Effective management of the trade-offs between ecosystem
   services is an important scientific problem in the study of
   social-ecological system management. According to the origin of ESs
   trade-offs, this study summarizes the management approaches of ES
   trade-off, and points out the shortcomings of the existing management
   approaches in terms of ``efficiency{''} and ``fairness{''}. Finally,
   according to the shortcomings, an ES trade-off management framework is
   proposed to improve the ``efficiency{''} and ``fairness{''} of ES
   trade-off management. The research shows that the ES trade-off
   management framework based on key ecosystem services (KESs) can improve
   the supply of the KESs, and promote the inevitable loss on the non-key
   ESs (NKESs) so as to improve the ``efficiency{''} of ES trade-off
   management. At the same time, the framework constructs compensation
   scheme of private winners to private losers is constructed to improve
   the ``fairness{''} of ES trade-off management. The results provide
   potential solutions for ecosystem service trade-off management.},

Title = {Operationalizing the social-ecological system framework to assess
   residential forest structure: a case study in Bloomington, Indiana},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Many actors, from the individual to neighborhood to municipal scale,
   influence the management of trees, grass, and other vegetation on
   residential properties. Recent work has been directed toward
   understanding the ecological characteristics of residential landscapes
   and the human drivers of landscape management; however, much of this
   work remains disciplinarily focused and at a single scale of analysis.
   This study employs a mixed-method approach to examine household- and
   neighborhood-scale drivers of urban residential tree species richness
   and tree canopy structure. A stratified sampling design was used to
   capture households in homeowners associations (HOAs) and neighborhood
   associations (NAs) to better understand the informal and formal
   institutions having an impact on residential tree management practices.
   We used the social-ecological system (SES) framework to build a
   classification system for identifying significant variables that
   influence residential tree composition and cover. Results of this work
   demonstrated tree species richness and canopy cover to be positively
   related to tree abundance and housing age, which is suggestive of the
   legacy effect. Governance variables were more strongly correlated with
   tree species richness whereas variables reflecting socioeconomic status
   and education were more strongly correlated with canopy cover. Rule
   compliance and fitting in with neighborhood landscaping norms was
   significantly more important to HOA households than NA households.
   Conversely, opportunities to work together to solve community problems
   were viewed more positively by NA households than HOA households. For
   all parcels together, compliance with city and HOA/NA rules was
   negatively related to tree species richness and canopy cover, a finding
   that may implicate the nature of rules that focus on tree removal
   practices and barriers to plant (what and where). This work is timely
   given the rapid expansion of neighborhood associations in urban areas,
   which parallels establishment of rules governing residential yard
   practices. If current arboriculture and urban forestry standards are
   considered during rule formation and implementation, such rules have the
   potential to promote species diversity and the sustained provisioning of
   ecosystem services.},

Journal = {AMBIO},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {45},
Number = {3, SI},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We studied how the failure to take into account gendered roles in the
   management of a communal pasture can affect the resilience of this
   social-ecological system. Data were collected using qualitative methods,
   including focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and participant
   observations from one community in the highlands of Ethiopia. The
   results show that women are excluded from the informal institution that
   defines the access and use rules which guide the management of the
   communal pasture. Consequently, women's knowledge, preferences, and
   needs are not taken into account. This negatively affects the resilience
   of the communal pasture in two ways. Firstly, the exclusion of women's
   knowledge leads to future adaptation options being overlooked. Secondly,
   as a result of the failure to address women's needs, they start to
   question the legitimacy of the informal institution. The case study thus
   shows how excluding women, i.e., side-lining their knowledge and needs,
   weakens social learning and the adaptiveness of the management rules.
   Being blind to gender-related issues may thus undermine the resilience
   of a social-ecological system.},

   System: A Conceptual Framework},

Abstract = {Hard-bodied ticks have become a major concern in temperate regions
   because they transmit a variety of pathogens of medical significance.
   Ticks and pathogens interact with hosts in a complex social-ecological
   system (SES) that influences human exposure to tick-borne diseases
   (TBD). We argue that addressing the urgent public health threat posed by
   TBD requires an understanding of the integrated processes in the forest
   ecosystem that influence tick density and infection prevalence,
   transmission among ticks, animal hosts, and ultimately disease
   prevalence in humans. We argue that collaborative modeling of the
   human-tick SES is required to understand the system dynamics as well as
   move science toward policy action. Recent studies in human health have
   shown the importance of stakeholder participation in understanding the
   factors that contribute to human exposure to zoonotic diseases. We
   discuss how collaborative modeling can be applied to understand the
   impacts of forest management practices on ticks and TBD. We discuss the
   potential of collaborative modeling for encouraging participation of
   diverse stakeholders in discussing the implications of managing forest
   ticks in the absence of large-scale control policy.},

Title = {Social-ecological Resilience and Biodiversity Conservation in a
   900-year-old Protected Area},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Protected areas are increasingly being recognized as coupled
   social-ecological systems, whose effectiveness depends on their
   resilience. Here I present a historical profile of an individual case
   study, the New Forest (England), which was first designated as a
   protected area more than 900 years ago. Uniquely, a traditional pattern
   of land use has been maintained ever since, providing a rare opportunity
   to examine the resilience of an integrated social-ecological system over
   nine centuries. The New Forest demonstrates that over the long term,
   coupled social-ecological systems can be resilient to major internal and
   external shocks, including climate change, mass human mortality and war.
   Changes in governance had the greatest impact on the reserve itself,
   with two major crises identified in the mid-19th and 20th centuries.
   Resolution of these crises depended on the formation of alliances
   between local people and external partners, including the general
   public, a process that was supported by improvements in visitor access.
   Over a timescale of centuries, this social-ecological system has been
   highly dynamic in disturbance regimes but relatively stable in land use
   patterns. However, the factors underpinning resilience have changed over
   time. This case study suggests that for protected areas to be effective
   over the long term, social structures and institutions as well as
   environmental processes require adaptive capacity.},

Title = {Not All Roads Lead to Resilience: a Complex Systems Approach to the
   Comparative Analysis of Tortoises in Arid Ecosystems},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The concept of resilience has been widely used in the study of
   social-ecological systems, with its key components identified as
   resistance, latitude, and precariousness. We use this concept to examine
   the differences among three semi-arid regions in terms of these three
   components. We do this by examining the status of tortoises that occur
   in the dry spiny forest Madagascar, the Karoo of South Africa, and the
   Mojave Desert of the United States as an indicator of the health and
   resilience of their respective ecosystems. Our findings demonstrate the
   tight coupling between societal development and ecosystem dynamics, the
   role of diversity in enhancing resilience, and the significance of local
   communal knowledge in sustaining it. Our findings also suggest that at
   each of the three sites, social parameters are the dominant drivers of
   change in the overall social-ecological system. We borrow the notions of
   control parameter and collective variable from dynamical systems theory
   to hypothesize that in present-day societies, social parameters might in
   fact be the control parameters of the greater social-ecological system,
   and that resilience is the collective variable that captures and
   demonstrates the overall behavior of the system.},

Title = {Toward a Social-Ecological Theory of Forest Macrosystems for Improved
   Ecosystem Management},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The implications of cumulative land-use decisions and shifting climate
   on forests, require us to integrate our understanding of ecosystems,
   markets, policy, and resource management into a social-ecological
   system. Humans play a central role in macrosystem dynamics, which
   complicates ecological theories that do not explicitly include human
   interactions. These dynamics also impact ecological services and related
   markets, which challenges economic theory. Here, we use two forest
   macroscale management initiatives to develop a theoretical understanding
   of how management interacts with ecological functions and services at
   these scales and how the multiple large-scale management goals work
   either in consort or conflict with other forest functions and services.
   We suggest that calling upon theories developed for organismal ecology,
   ecosystem ecology, and ecological economics adds to our understanding of
   social-ecological macrosystems. To initiate progress, we propose future
   research questions to add rigor to macrosystem-scale studies: (1) What
   are the ecosystem functions that operate at macroscales, their necessary
   structural components, and how do we observe them? (2) How do systems at
   one scale respond if altered at another scale? (3) How do we both
   effectively measure these components and interactions, and communicate
   that information in a meaningful manner for policy and management across
   different scales?},

Title = {Community forestry in a changing context: A perspective from Nepal's
   mid-hill},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {138},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Community forestry (CF) is one of the major forest management modalities
   in the world. A growing body of literature documents various outcomes
   and interactions of people with CF, but limited studies have assessed
   the mode of forest-people interaction considering changing
   socio-economic and environmental contexts by employing a broader
   theoretical framework. Our study employed Ostrom's social-ecological
   system (SES) framework accompanied by a meta-synthesis of peer-reviewed
   literature (n = 74), review of policy documents and census reports (n =
   28), interviews with four stakeholder groups (n = 47) and group
   discussions with district-level forest user groups (n = 20), to explore
   the changed context in Nepal's mid-hills since 1990 s. The study
   revealed transformational changes in socio-economic and environmental
   contexts of Nepal's mid-hills compared to the conditions in which the CF
   was developed during 1990 s. Changes in the forces (or factors) of SES,
   including demography, socio-economic development, government policy and
   environmental discourse are so pronounced that its feedback to the
   social-ecological system is discernible. For example, the evolving
   dynamics have changed the mode of forest-people interaction and their
   relationship by altering land use practices, resource use patterns,
   farm-forestry linkage, and pool of human resources, which is reflected
   in diminishing participation, social capital, collective action, and
   (voluntary) contribution to CF management. Such (emerging) dynamics in
   the social-ecological system could further jeopardise CF institutions
   and their deliberation, weaken the forest-food security nexus, augment
   leadership gaps in forest management, and impede the country's efforts
   in achieving global climate and development goals. To revitalize CF in
   this changing context, we suggest that community forests should be
   managed in three different models: urban, protection and production by
   putting payment of ecosystem services in place. As Nepal is a global
   leader in CF and its policies are informing forest and land use policies
   around the world, the outcomes of our study could offer an insight to
   the decision-makers of other countries for recalibrating land use
   policies by considering evolving local and global dynamics and their
   feedback to SES.},

Title = {Enhancing the Ostrom social-ecological system framework through
   formalization},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Frameworks play an important role in analyzing social-ecological systems
   (SESs) because they provide shared concepts and variables that enable
   comparison between and accumulation of knowledge across multiple cases.
   One prominent SES framework focusing on local resource use has been
   developed by Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues. This framework is an
   extensive multi-tier collection of concepts and variables that have
   demonstrated relevance for explaining outcomes in a large number of case
   studies in the context of fishery, water, and forestry common-pool
   resources. The further development of this framework has raised a number
   of issues related to the formal relationships between the large number
   of concepts and variables involved. In particular, issues related to
   criteria for ordering the concepts into tiers, adding new concepts,
   defining outcomes metrics, and representing dynamics in the framework
   have been identified. We address these issues by applying methods from
   research fields that study formal relationships between concepts such as
   domain-specific languages, knowledge representation, and software
   engineering. We find that SES frameworks could include the following
   seven formal components: variables, concepts, attribution relationships,
   subsumption relationships, process relationships, aggregation
   relationships, and evaluation metrics. Applying these components to the
   Ostrom framework and a case study of recreational fishery, we find that
   they provide clear criteria for structuring concepts into tiers,
   defining outcome metrics, and representing dynamics. The components
   identified are generic, and the insights gained from this exercise may
   also be beneficial for the development of other SES frameworks.},

   development?},

Volume = {592},
Pages = {124-133},

Abstract = {The protected area approach has extended from conserving biodiversity to
   improving human well- being. However, the relationship between
   conservation and socioeconomic and cultural development continues to be
   controversial. This paper combines land use variables with socioeconomic
   and cultural variables through multivariate ordination analysis and
   evaluates their evolution in two areas inside and outside a Biosphere
   Reserve since the approval of the Governance Plan for Use and Management
   in the Reserve. The results indicate a similar tendency in the two
   areas, from the abandonment of traditional rural activities and decline
   in pine plantations to naturalness, urban sprawl and the growth of the
   tertiary economic sector, welfare indicators and sustainability index.
   However, it can be broadly observed that the region included inside the
   protected area presents better conservation features (native forest) and
   rural systems (forestry and primary economic sector) than the region
   outside the protected area while maintaining similar socioeconomic and
   cultural conditions. We suggest that the designation of the Biosphere
   Reserve does not influence the local population negatively but does
   safeguard its conservation, which could have enhanced socioeconomic and
   cultural development. Thus, even though certain changes must be made to
   replace the conifer plantations and encourage agricultural activities,
   the designation of the protected area fulfills its sustainability goal
   and enhances the local population's quality of life. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {In the Pamir Mountains of Eastern Tajikistan, the clearance of mountain
   forests to provide fuelwood for an increasing population is a major
   source of environmental degradation. International development
   organisations have implemented joint forestry management institutions to
   help restore once-forested mountainous regions, but the success of these
   institutions has been highly variable. This study uses a multi-method
   approach, drawing on institutional analysis supported by Elinor Ostrom's
   design principles and social-ecological system framework in combination
   with resilience thinking to help understand why some communities in
   Tajikistan manage their forests more sustainably than others. The
   application of the design principles provided helpful guidance for
   practitioners implementing joint forestry management. The
   social-ecological system analysis revealed both `history of use' and
   `tenant density' as positively associated with forest condition.
   However, we also identify limitations of snapshot social-ecological
   assessments. In particular, we illustrate the critical importance of
   considering historical legacy effects, such as externally imposed
   centralised governance regimes (that characterise many post-Soviet
   states) in attempts to understand current management practices. Our work
   shows how a more nuanced understanding of institutional change and
   inertia can be achieved by adopting a resilience approach to
   institutional analysis, focusing on the importance of reorganisation.
   Lessons learned from our analysis should be widely applicable to common
   pool resource management in other semi-arid forested landscapes as well
   as in regions with a strong centralised governance legacy.},

Abstract = {The Mayans of the Yucatan Peninsula, together with their environment,
   conform social-ecological systems with adaptation and resilience to
   natural, political and economic disturbances. In this study, we use the
   framework of social-ecological systems for describing a mechanism that
   allows a Mayan community and its natural environment to respond to
   disturbances over time. We describe (1) the activities that members of
   the community develop as part of their strategy for managing natural
   resource management, and (2) the history of the social-ecological system
   focusing on meaningful events: changes in their institutional body,
   landscape and/or practices for exploiting natural resources, and
   interactions between these changes. Through both semi-structured and
   in-depth interviews, historical narratives and participant observation,
   we found that managers use the environmental heterogeneity to diversify
   the exploitation of species, manage the secondary vegetation and protect
   mature vegetation. Formal and informal institutions of access,
   regulation and administration of natural resources regulate productive
   activities and management practices. These institutions operate
   differentially at the levels of environmental units (prohibition of the
   exploitation of the natural resources of mature tropical forests) and
   species (protection of the jaguar and cougar). Diversification of
   productive activities, management of environmental heterogeneity and the
   presence of flexible institutions enable responses in the
   social-ecological systems that have the potential to contribute to its
   long-term maintenance. Comprehensive studies like this might help to
   understand adaptive capacity and social-ecological resilience.},

Title = {Community forest and mushrooms: Collective action initiatives in rural
   areas of Galicia},
Journal = {FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {135},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Galicia is a region situated in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula
   where community forests are very much spread. This kind of ownership is
   held by local communities that, collectively, decide how to manage the
   forest and its mycological resources as part of its non-timber forest
   products. In this work, we characterize and analyse the existing
   governance modalities for the collective use of mycological resources in
   both their material and immaterial aspects, and we do it by applying a
   social-ecological system framework combined with a knowledge economy
   model. Up to 21 mycological use initiatives have been identified and
   inventoried. Most of them manage the common resource through mycological
   reserves (open or closed), but there are others that produce and sell
   mushrooms. The work shows how communities use their governance
   mechanisms to define rules aimed at improving sustainability and the
   influx of revenues. In addition, we analyse how some of these
   initiatives are starting to manage their common immaterial resources
   (associated with values such as quality and with eco-certifications,
   etc.), and to develop innovative strategies (short supply chains) for
   the purpose of improving their position in the value chain. The text
   discusses community management as a strategy that allows combining
   sustainability objectives in the management of mycological resources
   with the raising of revenues in the long term. Finally, we underline the
   need for public policies that support successful experiences and
   strengthen the capacity of community institutions to appropriate the
   value they generate.},

Title = {Unbalanced social-ecological development within the Dongting Lake basin:
   Inspiration from evaluation of ecological restoration projects},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {315},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {The targets of ecosystem restoration have gradually transformed from a
   narrow focus on single or a few ecosystem services to a compound mode
   focusing on ecological, social and economic benefits. The
   socialecological system provides an integrative perspective to promote
   this transformation by reestablishing the relation between human and
   natural systems. Over the past 30 years, several ecological restoration
   projects have been implemented in the Dongting Lake basin to reverse
   ecological deterioration and improve agricultural production. This paper
   investigates the spatio-temporal dynamics of social-ecological changes
   in the Dongting Lake basin based on land use/cover and NDVI change
   trends. Results showed that the large-scale ecological restoration
   projects did not evidently increase the area of forest and grass in the
   basin, however, NDVI showed a significant growth trend. The
   social-ecological changes and its relevance to ecological restoration
   were also identified. From 2000 to 2015, water retention had the largest
   increment (95.70\%), followed by soil conservation (25.90\%), whereas
   carbon sequestration decreased slightly (-1.49\%). At the same time, the
   economy and agriculture in the basin also developed. Although the
   ecological restoration projects had promoted the overall socio-economic
   development and ecosystem restoration in Dongting Lake basin, their
   distribution and influence were disequilibrium within the basin. It
   seemed difficult for most counties to achieve rapid socio-economic
   development and improve ecosystem services at the same time. The benefit
   evaluation of ecological restoration projects based on social-ecological
   system can help to build on and reinforce existing restoration
   initiatives, and promote the sharing of experiences and good practices
   in ecosystem conservation and restoration practices.},

Abstract = {Currently more than 600 million of the 800 million people in SSA are

   successful woody-biomass industry. This paper documents a first attempt
   at analysing why these plants failed. It aims to contextualisethe
   potential role of a sustainable woody-biomass sector in South Africa,
   through firstly developing a SES-based analytical framework and
   secondly, using this to undertake a retrospective resilience-based risk
   assessment of the four former woodybiomass pellet plants in order to
   identify strategies for increasing the resilience of the industry. The
   SES-based framework advances previous theory, which usually focuses on
   natural resources and their supply, by introducing a production process
   (with inputs and outputs), internal business dynamics and ecological
   variable interactions. The risk assessment can be used at a broad level
   to highlight important aspects which should be considered during
   feasibility assessments for new plants. Further work is proposed to
   focus on splitting the social-ecological system at different scales for
   further analysis, and to investigate the long-term ecological impacts of
   woody-biomass utilisation.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses prospects for ecosystem-based adaptation, through
   examining diverse forest-people interactions in Nepal's community
   forestry as a social-ecological system (SES). We examine the linkage
   between social-ecological resilience and societal adaptation in the
   Middle Hills of Nepal and, based on this, discuss the prospects of this
   system for climate adaptation. In doing so, we also discuss the
   prospects of community forestry for ecosystem-based adaptation in the
   rural agrarian context, focussing on a few attributes of resilience:
   diversity, modularity, and flexibility. We find that community forestry
   provides multiple pathways for both reactive and anticipatory
   adaptation, often reinforcing community resilience. Our finding also
   shows that, while ecological processes in community forestry (CF) are
   being managed by local institutions with an explicit goal to enhance the
   overall resilience of the SES, the underlying social and political
   dynamics of CF tend to be neglected in adaptation policy and planning.
   This prevents local organizations from harnessing the benefits of
   ecological resilience to enhance their adaptive capacity. The
   contribution of ecological resilience to societal adaptation has been
   constrained by large scale social and political drivers, especially
   bureaucratic structures underpinning the governance of forest in Nepal.
   Based on these findings, we recommend that ecosystem-based adaptation is
   fully informed by, and takes account of, local power dynamics. For
   instance, aligning governance and decision-making with the needs of
   marginalized groups can increase the resilience and adaptive capacity of
   social-ecological systems.},

Title = {Ecosystem Services Assessment for the Conservation of Mangroves in
   French Guiana Using Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JAN 12},
Abstract = {In 2016, the French government adopted a law for biodiversity, setting
   an objective of protecting 55,000 hectares of mangroves. This objective
   is particularly important to French Guiana, which shelters almost 60\%
   of French mangrove ecosystems, and where mangroves occupy three quarters
   of the coastline. The coast of French Guiana is also where issues
   associated with demographic and economic dynamics concentrate. There is
   thus a need to plan for an economic development that is compatible with
   the objective of protecting mangrove ecosystems. Ecosystem services (ES)
   assessment can support such decision-making, informing on the costs and
   benefits associated with alternative mangrove conservation strategies.
   While the many services provided by mangrove ecosystems are well
   documented worldwide, the extent to which these can be encountered in
   the specific case of French Guiana is currently only very partially
   known. Relying on the Fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) approach, we
   collected and compared the perception of multiple and heterogeneous
   groups of stakeholders, of the functioning of the mangrove
   social-ecological system at the scale of French Guiana. Results, allow
   to identify mangroves ES and threats particularly influenced by the high
   sedimentary dynamism of the shoreline. This generates two distinct
   components of the mangrove social-ecological system: mud banks where
   ecosystem services are spatially and temporally unstable, and associated
   with perceived constraints for key coastal activities, and estuarine
   mangroves where the ecosystem services usually described in the
   literature on mangroves can be found. Disservices associated with
   mangrove ecosystems were also identified as a key interaction. This can
   inform the research needs that should support sustainable development
   trajectories, fully accounting for the protection of French Guianese
   mangrove ecosystems.},

Title = {Forest Management Devolution: Gap Between Technicians' Design and
   Villagers' Practices in Madagascar},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {877-893},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In the 1980s, tropical forest-management principles underwent a shift
   toward approaches giving greater responsibilities to rural people. One
   argument for such a shift were the long-term relations established
   between rural people and their natural resources. In Madagascar, a new
   law was drawn up in 1996 (Gelose law), which sought to integrate rural
   people into forest management. A gap was observed between the changes
   foreseen by the projects implementing the Gelose law and the actual
   changes. In this article, we use the concept of the social-ecological
   system (SES) to analyze that gap. The differences existing between the
   planned changes set by the Gelose contract in the village of Ambatoloaka
   (northwest of Madagascar) and the practices observed in 2010 were
   conceptualized as a gap between two SESs. The first SES is the targeted
   one (i.e., a virtual one); it corresponds to the designed Gelose
   contract. The second SES is the observed one. It is characterized by the
   heterogeneity of forest users and uses, which have several impacts on
   forest management, and by very dynamic social and ecological systems.
   The observed SES has been reshaped contingent on the constraints and
   opportunities offered by the Gelose contract as well as on other
   ecological and social components. The consequences and opportunities
   that such an SES reshaping would offer to improve the implementation of
   the Gelose law are discussed. The main reasons explaining the gap
   between the two SESs are as follows: (1) the clash between static and
   homogeneous perceptions in the targeted SES and the dynamics and
   heterogeneity that characterize the observed SES; and (2) the focus on
   one specific use of forest ecosystems (i.e., charcoal-making) in the
   targeted SES. Forest management in the observed SES depends on several
   uses of forest ecosystems.},

Title = {Weighing values and risks of beloved invasive species: The case of the
   survivor tree and conflict management in urban green infrastructure},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {40},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {44-52},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A critical aspect of urban green infrastructure management hinges on the
   treatment of native and invasive species. Invasive species are widely
   seen as a major threat, yet the context-specific values people have for
   some of these species pose challenges for their management. Here, we
   offer a case study of the 9/11 survivor tree, a Gallery pear (Pyres
   calleryana Decne.) that survived the terrorist attack on September 11,
   2001 at the World Trade Center in New York City and has since become a
   symbol of resilience. That individual tree and its progeny are beloved
   and they are also characterized as invasive. As part of the longitudinal
   research of the US Forest Service Living Memorials Project, we report
   findings from semi-structured interviews conducted with eight stewards
   from six living memorial sites that have survivor trees and with five
   individuals who have expert knowledge of the survivor tree, its
   propagation and dissemination. We find that some people see the tree
   primarily as a heroic symbol of hope and resilience, others see it
   primarily a threat to personal property, safety, and to biodiversity,
   which overshadow its social value. We conclude that Gallery pears are
   associated with multiple, conflicting values, having the power to both
   unite and divide around issues of recovery and resilience in social and
   ecological spheres. Whereas managers and policy makers tend to have
   absolute views of invasive species as negative, living memorial stewards
   and others affected by tragedies have personal relationships that
   significantly influence their attitudes and practices toward a line of
   Gallery pears. We conclude that urban green infrastructure management
   might best be seen as a highly contingent and value-driven practice, and
   that understanding these social meanings may lead to better stewardship
   of the whole social-ecological system.},

Title = {Which infrastructures for which forest function? Analyzing
   multifunctionality through the social-ecological system framework},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Landscapes are subject to ecological and socioeconomic forces of change
   that interact in complex ways. To cope with these changes, landscape
   planning of natural resource management integrates sociocultural,
   ecological, and economic considerations in an analytic and systemic way.
   In this regard, social-ecological system (SES) frameworks have been
   developed to help analyze key factors that drive the dynamics of such
   complex adaptive systems. For forests, multifunctional management, which
   also highlights the ecological and socioeconomic roles of forests for
   society, has become a central objective for several European countries
   (e.g., France, Italy, and Germany). However, further development of
   methods, tools, and conceptual approaches is needed to facilitate our
   understanding of the arrangements behind management practices that
   include complex human-environment interactions. This study adopts
   Ostrom's SES framework and Anderies' robustness framework to highlight
   how forestry institutions affect forest ecosystems, forest functions,
   and social arrangements. As an illustration, we apply both frameworks to
   the Quatre-Montagnes forest, located in the south-east of France, in
   which multifunctionality is a major objective of forest governance. We
   first apply the SES framework to construct an analysis of the
   Quatre-Montagnes forest, specifying the first-tier and second-tier
   variables. From this, we describe the importance of
   infrastructure-related variables in shaping the interactions between
   components of the SES. We then apply the robustness framework, developed
   by Anderies, because we believe this framework enables a better analysis
   of ecosystem functions for infrastructure governance than the SES
   framework, which provides a better descriptive capacity for the
   variables. We discuss insights, based on our infrastructure analysis,
   which can be used when establishing designs for efficient forest
   management with heavy infrastructure dependencies.},

Title = {Participation of diverse actors and usage of traditional and local

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {The participation of diverse actors and usage of traditional and local
   knowledge have been recognized as important for ecosystem management,
   including local biodiversity strategies and action plans (LBSAPs)
   implemented in municipalities. Assessing the effects and influences of
   the participation of diverse actors and usage of traditional and local
   knowledge requires analyses by a social-ecological system framework.
   This study aimed to clarify (1) how the participation of diverse actors
   and the recognition and usage of traditional knowledge that is passed
   down from generation to generation, and local knowledge that is unique
   to a local community were related to LBSAP actions and effects and (2)
   how various social and ecological factors were related with the
   participation of diverse actors and traditional and local knowledge. We
   conducted a questionnaire survey and obtained the data from 70
   municipalities that have formulated LBSAPs, in addition to other
   existing data from various sources. We then performed a multiple
   regression analysis using the full model including all explanatory
   variables. A positive relationship was observed between the variables
   for the participation of diverse actors and traditional and local
   knowledge and the variables for the information sharing, deliberation
   processes, the evaluative and investment activities of LBSAPs. For
   example, deliberation process of an LBSAP was thought to have provided
   an opportunity to recognize and learn local knowledge. Consciousness of
   local knowledge and usage of traditional knowledge in an LBSAP were then
   associated with awareness of change toward biodiversity among citizens.

Title = {Analyzing the mutual feedbacks between lake pollution and human
   behaviour in a mathematical social-ecological model},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {43},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Does the adoption of environment-oriented actions by individuals
   necessarily improve the state of an ecosystem in the most effective way?
   We address this question with the example of eutrophication in shallow
   lakes. When exposed to fertilizers, such lakes can undergo a critical
   transition called eutrophication, resulting in a loss of biodiversity
   and ecosystem services. We couple a generic model of eutrophication with
   a best-response model of human behaviour, where agents can choose to
   pollute the lake at a high level (defection) or at a low level
   (cooperation). It is known that feedbacks between the interacting lake
   pollution and human behaviour can give rise to complex dynamics with
   multiple stable states and oscillations. Here, we analyze the impact of
   all model parameters on the shape of the nullclines. S-shaped nullclines
   are a condition for complex dynamics to occur. Moreover, we find that
   agents decreasing their pollution discharge into the lake is not
   necessarily the most effective way to reduce the pollution level in the
   lake. This is due to coexisting counterintuitive stable equilibria where
   the lake is in a clear state despite a high level of pollution
   discharge. We analyze the complex dynamics of the system and describe in
   detail Hopf, saddle-node, homoclinic and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations.
   The complex dynamics with potential multistability and counterintuitive
   equilibria suggests that generic management recommendations holding for
   every level of pollution and of cooperation are impossible. Apart from
   the direct perturbation of an ecological variable, we identify three
   ways a management strategy can influence the social-ecological system:
   it can change the location, the resilience and the existence of stable
   equilibria.},

Abstract = {Over the past few decades, social-ecological transformations have
   contributed to the restoration of numerous carnivores, presenting new
   challenges for human-wildlife coexistence. Evaluating and understanding
   human-wildlife interaction dynamics, particularly for conflict-prone
   species, is crucial for conservation and management strategies. Our
   study focuses on Asiatic Black Bear (Ursus thibetanus) in Western
   Yunnan, China, a region with favourable bear conditions and significant
   environmental changes due to conservation policies. This study employed
   a multifaceted approach to gather data on bear occurrences and
   human-bear conflicts. Utilising species distribution models, we
   predicted the potential bear habitat in 2000 and 2020. We proposed a
   methodology integrating bear habitat with human footprint to delineate
   the human-bear interface. Additionally, we evaluated the
   spatial-temporal variations in bear habitat and human-bear interface
   between 2000 and 2020. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to
   capture the perceptions of local communities regarding the bear
   population, human-bear interactions and conservation policies. Our
   findings indicated that the potential habitats of bears were strongly
   influenced by forest cover. We noticed improvements in bear habitat from
   2000 to 2020, notwithstanding localised losses in specific areas. Most
   respondents attributed the increasing bear population to forest
   restoration and reduced human impact during this period. Notably, a
   significant proportion of respondents supported the conservation
   policies, previously participating in their formulation and
   implementation. Our analysis further revealed increases in the
   human-bear interface and human-bear interactions from 2000 to 2020.
   Remarkably, these changes did not significantly diminish local
   communities' endorsement of conservation policies. This resilience can
   be attributed to the net positive impacts of conservation policies on
   the livelihoods of these communities. Our study highlights the
   complexity and dynamic nature of human-wildlife interactions within the
   social-ecological system and provides new insights to facilitate
   sustainable conservation and management measures.Read the free Plain

Title = {The Zo'e perspective on what scientists call ``forest management{''} and
   its implications for floristic diversity and biocultural conservation},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Indigenous perspectives on forest management are grounded in traditional
   ecological knowledge (TEK), so that socioculture influences the ways
   Indigenous Peoples transform their landscapes. However, how socioculture
   structures Indigenous perspectives on forest management is unclear.
   Moreover, little is known about the influence of Indigenous landscape
   transformations on forest succession and floristic diversity. Here, we
   test hypotheses from biocultural and ecological theories suggesting
   that: (i) key social-ecological relationships with specific taxa
   structure Indigenous perspectives on forest management; (ii) such
   relationships guide sustainable management that generates resilient
   forest regrowth; and (iii) this management promotes floristic diversity
   by acting as an intermediate disturbance. We collected information about
   cosmology, occupation history and management among the Zo`e, in
   Brazilian Amazonia. We also carried out floristic inventories in
   old-growth forests and in old Zo`e swidden-fallow areas to analyze
   forest structure and alpha-and beta-diversity along a gradient of forest
   successional stages. We show that the Zo`e perspective on forest
   management is structured by an ethical principle involving a
   social-ecological relationship with different beings, especially the
   spider monkey (Ateles sp.). This relationship generates mobility among
   the Zo`e that allows forest regrowth in their fallow areas, so that in
   28 years, forest basal area may equal that of old-growth forests. Also,
   Zo`e forest management has increased alpha-and beta-diversity by
   increasing species richness and diversity in intermediate secondary
   forests and promoting floristic turnover at the landscape-level. These
   results show that some aspects of Zo`e cosmology influence forest
   disturbance regimes that generate a sustainable social-ecological
   system, therefore being key for Zo`e well-being and local biodiversity
   conservation. We believe that Indigenous perspectives about forest
   management should be included in forest conservation efforts aimed at
   protecting Amazonian biocultural diversity, thus valuing TEK and
   engendering sustainable social-ecological systems.},

Abstract = {In Morocco, sacred groves called marabouts constitute a dense network of
   wild-forest remnants of high ecological and cultural value but which are
   threatened by global change. In this study, we investigated the
   relationship between sacred natural site (SNS) structure and landscape
   dynamics in the traditional Mediterranean landscape of the Beni Arouss
   tribe in Northern Morocco. The total number of sacred sites considered
   was 101, with an average density of 3 SNSs per 10 km(2) and an average
   area of 2.73 ha per SNS covered with natural vegetation-mainly cork oak
   forests (Quercus suber), woodlands (Quercus coccifera, Olea europaea),
   and scrublands. Analysis of the vascular plants in these sacred groves
   showed that there were 73 natural species and 3 fruit species in total;
   the natural species belonged to four plant forms: 6 tree species, 10
   liana species, 20 shrub species, and 37 herbaceous plant species. To
   investigate the relationships between sacred groves and landscape
   change, the territory was divided into 51 land-use clusters around rural
   settlements. Multivariate analysis permitted the identification of three
   types of clusters categorized according to social-ecological system
   (SES): forest (F), agro-forest (AF), and agriculture (A). The landscape
   dynamics over the period from 1986 to 2003 were investigated, and those
   dynamics were found to be dominated by the conversion of forest to
   agriculture, which resulted in the transformation of 25\% of the SESs
   from F-SESs and AF-SESs into A-SESs during the period considered.
   Statistical comparisons of plant forms in sacred groves belonging to
   stable SESs during the period 1986-2003 showed that tree richness and
   liana cover were higher in F-SESs than in A-SESs, shrub richness and
   cover were higher in AF-SESs than in A-SESs, but there were no plant
   forms differences between F-SESs and AF-SESs. We argue that SES
   transformation processes-as represented by spatial dynamics-involve a
   regression of sacred groves, such that the functional plant groups of
   sacred groves could be considered ecological indicators.},

Title = {The Navigate framework: How the ecosystem services and resilience
   concepts can help us navigate in the current crises},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {64},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the last decades, humanity has considerably altered the functioning
   of Earth, resulting in global and interrelated social, economic, and
   environmental crises. To address these crises, the concepts of ES and
   resilience look promising to understand the complexity of the
   social-ecological system (SES) and its dynamics. However, operational
   frameworks that bring together these two concepts are still lacking. We
   therefore propose the Navigate framework to guide the researchers and
   the managers in finding sustainable solutions, in other words safe and
   just strategies.This framework was built from a literature review,
   interviews with leading experts, and feedback from its implementation in
   a case study.The conceptual part of the Navigate framework illustrates
   the multiple interactions between nature and society, depicted by the
   ES, occurring at various scales. Following disturbances, the SES
   responds by either persisting, adapting or even transforming (i.e. three
   forms of resilience). The operational part of Navigate suggests six
   steps to follow in an iterative process: (1) define the system, (2)
   define the problem, the stakes and goals, (3) define the pathways, (4)
   assess the ES, (5) assess the resilience, and (6) design the action
   plan. The implementation of this framework to a case study demonstrated
   that together ES and resilience with a participatory process gave a
   comprehensive picture of the SES, essential to making sound sustainable
   decisions. Indeed, the integrated assessment of ES combining various
   complementary methods highlights the stakeholders' needs and
   perspectives, the various forms of knowledge, the scales, and the
   interactions. Resilience broadened the analysis by understanding how the
   important drivers impacted the SES and its ES.In conclusion, the
   Navigate framework shows the way (i.e. which ES the stakeholders have
   requested) while considering the dynamic properties of the SES, amidst
   increasing social and ecological uncertainties, to navigate together
   toward sustainability.},

Title = {History Lessons from the Late Joseon Dynasty Period of Korea: Human
   Technology (<i>Ondol</i>), Its Impacts on Forests and People, and the
   Role of the Government},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Historical analogies can help us contextualize new technical
   developments with social, cultural, and political forces at work. The
   late Joseon Dynasty period of Korea (1639-1910), a closed economy with
   detailed written records, provides a rare opportunity to examine a
   social-ecological system (SES) responding to drivers of change over a
   long period of time. Based on historical records and reconstructed data,
   we aim to: (1) characterize how the expansion of human technology, Ondol
   (traditional underfloor heating system), affected different subsystems
   and their interactions within the SES over time, (2) examine the role of
   the government in promoting the technology and regulating its impacts,
   and (3) summarize the pertinent lessons learned from old Korea for
   governing a modern-day bioeconomy. Ondol allows various forest biomass
   to be utilized as household fuel, including fuelwood, forest litter, and
   grass scraped from forest floor. Continuous biomass harvesting over 250
   years to feed Ondol contributed to forest degradation and the forest
   ecosystem condition trapped in the early successional stage in the
   Korean Peninsula. The ecological changes were exacerbated by the Pine
   Policy with a singular focus on reserving Korean red pine (Pinus
   densiflora Siebold and Zucc.) for government uses. The policy failed to
   recognize basic needs of the public while countenancing an expansion of
   Ondol and a cultural preference for heated floors that propagated an
   increased use of biomass fuel. This case illustrates the importance of
   recognizing potential technology traps where a human innovation opened
   opportunities for more resource use. The lessons learned from old Korea
   show that bioeconomy transitions would require multifaceted governance
   responses while being cautious about being too closely tied to the
   dominant national agenda. Environmental history has much to offer for
   understanding the social and ecological systemic risks of the current
   technical developments. We call for more historical analogs from
   different parts of the world to ``move forward by looking back{''}.},

   future social and ecological thresholds of concern; (3) embracing
   diversity/heterogeneity as principles in ecological and social

Title = {Understanding opportunities for urban forest expansion to inform goals:
   Working toward a virtuous cycle in New York City},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {4},
Month = {NOV 23},
Abstract = {Urban forests are critical infrastructure for mitigating environmental
   and social challenges cities face. Municipalities and non-governmental
   entities, among others, often set goals (e.g., tree planting or canopy
   targets) to support urban forests and their benefits. We develop the
   conceptual underpinnings for an analysis of where additional canopy can
   fit within the landscape, while considering factors that influence where
   trees can be planted, and canopy can grow ({''}practical canopy{''}). We
   apply this in New York City (NYC) to inform the setting of a canopy goal
   by the NYC Urban Forest Task Force (UFTF) for the NYC Urban Forest
   Agenda, which may trigger a virtuous cycle, or a positive feedback loop
   where people are mobilized to protect the urban forest, and its benefits
   that ultimately motivate people to commit to its conservation. We
   further develop framing for a ``priority canopy{''} analysis to
   understand where urban forest expansion should be prioritized given more
   context (e.g., environmental hazards and local preferences), which can
   inform how expansion of the urban forest is achieved. We estimate an
   opportunity for 15,899 ha of new canopy in NYC given existing
   opportunities and constraints (practical canopy), which, if leveraged,
   could result in nearly doubling the canopy as of 2017 (17,253 ha).
   However, like existing canopy, practical canopy is not evenly
   distributed, in general, or across jurisdictions and land uses. Relying
   solely on areas identified as practical canopy to expand the urban
   forest would exacerbate these inequities. We discuss how the NYC UFTF
   established a visionary and achievable goal of at least 30\% canopy
   cover by 2035, informed by this analysis and guided by priorities of
   equity, health, and resilience. Achievement of this goal will ultimately
   require a combination of protecting and stewarding the existing
   resource, and leveraging opportunities for tree planting. Achieving a
   more equitable urban forest will also require identification of priority
   canopy, and, in cases, creation of new opportunities for tree planting
   and canopy expansion. Overall, the collaborative establishment of such
   goals based on local context can be instrumental in creating a virtuous
   cycle, moving conservation actors toward exercising influence and agency
   within the social-ecological system.},

Month = {2023 AUG 5},
Abstract = {Subsistence farmers in elephant rangelands suffer food insecurity,
   economic losses and emotional stress from crop damage by elephants,
   resulting in reduced local support toward elephant conservation. To
   foster human-elephant co-existence in a dynamic social-ecological
   system, we explored the validity of Classification Tree (CT) analysis
   application to identify human-elephant hotspots in an effort to target
   approaches to reduce human-elephant conflicts. The CT analysis revealed
   that the most important factors affecting occurrence of crop damage were
   crop types, field sizes and distance to nearest road and river. From CT
   generated thresholds, we propose establishment of multi-criteria-based
   risk zones, as an alternative approach, to quickly identify and
   prioritize future human-elephant conflict (HEC) hotspots for improved
   agrarian livelihood and elephant conservation outcomes. We also
   explained the limitations of CT models. This study contributes to the

Abstract = {The role of community-based natural resources management in the form of
   ``greening{''} after large scale system shocks and surprises is argued
   to provide multiple benefits via engagement with living elements of

   and applies it to the hybrid symbol of the tree in postdisaster
   contexts. The paper briefly highlights three U.S. cases documenting the
   symbolic roles of trees in a context of significant shock to a
   social-ecological system: the terrorist attacks on New York City in
   2001, the devastating hurricane that struck New Orleans in 2005, and the

Title = {Revisiting the Resilience of Chestnut Forests in Corsica: from
   Social-Ecological Systems Theory to Political Ecology},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The ``chestnut civilization{''} is often used to qualify agrarian inland
   Corsica. Based on a critical review of historical sources and research
   on present dynamics, we show how this ``civilization{''} has built up on
   a long series of resistance and adaptation to external political forces,
   from Genovese and French domination up to the present period of
   independence claims. The construction of the castagnetu, the Corsican
   chestnut (Castanea sativa mill.) forest, as a social-ecological system
   is based on a constantly evolving compromise between wild and domestic
   attributes, but also on socio-political resistance, incorporation, and
   innovation. We argue that the castagnetu's resilience, beyond its
   social-ecological qualities and its economic profitability, is closely
   linked to a constant incorporation of identity and cultural values into
   chestnut trees and gardens, but also to the role assigned to the
   castagnetu by its supporters in the political positioning of their
   relations to both central power and outside actors.},

Abstract = {Payment for ecosystem services (PES) is one of the most commonly used
   economic instruments developed for biological conservation. Evidence has
   shown the importance of the local context in PES design and
   implementation, and the complexity of defining and specifying this
   context. We developed a proposal to narrow the local context, using the
   social-ecological system's framework, through two case studies: San
   Antonio, an indigenous community in Oaxaca, Mexico, and El Ajusco, a
   community in the periphery of Mexico City. This chapter discusses ten
   variables drawn from a series of interviews to approach the local
   context. Four of these variables stand out because of their incidence on
   the way PES outcomes are perceived, and on the local context definition:
   opportunity costs, confidence and cooperation, internal organization,
   and the presence and experience of NGOs.},

Abstract = {This paper analyses the tragic 2009 wildfire of Horta de Sant Joan in
   Catalonia. The local environmental history, the changes in land use of
   the pre-fire forest landscape, and the clash between different social
   discourses after the wildfire reveal different sociopolitical forms of
   constructing the relationship between nature and society. Each social
   actor explains wildfire and forest management according to different
   time scales and interests. These discourses can be classified by the
   degree of inclusion or exclusion of fire in the social-ecological
   system. The contextualisation and analysis of the ``desired
   landscapes{''} proposed by the social actors allows for a deeper
   reflection on contested understandings and values in relation to forests
   and wildfires. We conclude by arguing in favour of a proper
   re-politicisation of the debate around the causes of and the responses
   to wildfires.},

Abstract = {Aboriginal peoples' respect for grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) is widely
   acknowledged, but rarely explored, in wildlife management discourse in
   northern Canada. Practices of respect expressed toward bears were
   observed and grouped into four categories: terminology, stories,
   reciprocity, and ritual. In the southwest Yukon, practices in all four
   categories form a coherent qualitative resource management system that
   may enhance the resilience of the bear-human system as a whole. This
   system also demonstrates the possibility of a previously unrecognized
   human role in maintaining productive riparian ecosystems and salmon
   runs, potentially providing a range of valued social-ecological
   outcomes. Practices of respect hold promise for new strategies to manage
   bear-human interactions, but such successful systems may be irreducibly
   small scale and place based.},

Title = {Relevance of cultural ecosystem services in nurturing ecological
   identity values that support restoration and conservation efforts},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {505},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {The research examines the potential role of restoring cultural ecosystem
   services in sustainably and equitably managing forested landscapes. It
   looks at how facilitating enhanced usage of cultural ecosystem services
   may mobilize ecological identities - or one's identification as a
   responsible agent to a natural system. The study focuses on the village
   groves of Korea that were restored during the first phase of the village
   grove restoration program (2003-2015) led by Korea Forest Service (KFS).
   Questionnaire survey was used to collect data on village leaders'
   ecological identity values (EIV) and their perception of how village
   groves' different ecosystem services are being used by villagers and
   non-villagers. These data were complemented by KFS-published information
   regarding the village groves' social-ecological system factors.
   Government documents and independent evaluation reports were analyzed to
   understand specifically how the restoration program addressed the task
   of restoring cultural values. Relationship between EIV and ecosystem
   service usage levels were examined by linear regression analysis, while
   difference tests were conducted to infer whether or not select
   social-ecological factors exhibit distinct difference in EIV or in
   ecosystem service usage levels. While the analytical results are far
   from conclusive, they hint at certain directions: first, the restoration
   program is found to have treated village groves themselves to be
   embodiments of cultural values. This approach leaves a wide gap to
   effective revival or reinvention of specific cultural uses or values
   that users can associate with. Second, the regression analysis shows
   generally stronger influence on village leaders' EIV by cultural
   ecosystem service usage than by usage of other service types. Examining
   by subtypes of cultural ecosystem services, those that are
   villager-oriented compared to visitor-oriented show higher influence on
   EIV, as do those individually-used compared to collectively-used. Third,
   the difference tests show no conclusive results about social-ecological
   system factors, except to speculate that factors conducive to
   visitor-oriented uses are found associated with lower EIV in village
   leaders. Furthermore, tourism attraction presence shows not only
   association with lower EIV but also with generally lower usage of the
   village groves' varoius ecosystem services. Such findings that show
   distinctions between villager-oriented andvisitor-oriented services and
   uses of village groves call for deliberative balancing of possible
   trade-offs between benefits to different user groups. This seminal study
   calls for further research on ecological identities, cultural values and
   cultural ecosystem services as potentially useful approaches to achieve
   more sustainable and equitable outcomes in restoration and conservation
   efforts.},

   resource management: the case of Vietnam},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {140-163},
Abstract = {Research and policy debates over natural resource management in
   developing countries have largely focused on identifying the set of
   institutions that best supports resource sustainability and poverty
   alleviation. We argue that beyond finding the right institutional fit
   for a social-ecological system, it is equally important to understand
   how context affects the design and outcomes of institutional reforms. We
   propose a refined conceptualisation of context, based on a revision of
   the Institutional Analysis and Development framework. We defend a
   systematic analysis of context, distinguishing between contextual
   factors affecting the fitness to local socio-ecological conditions and
   contextual factors that mobilise power such as political-economic
   interests and prevailing discourses. We illustrate our argument with
   empirical research on land-tenure reforms that have been implemented
   since the 1980s in northern Vietnam. The proposed analytical framework
   and conceptualisation of context allows a more pervasive understanding
   of contextual factors, enabling the incorporation of the forms of power
   that give meaning and legitimacy to institutional change.},

   Areas},
Journal = {FIRE-SWITZERLAND},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Wildfires in the Iberian Peninsula were large and frequent in the second
   half of the 20th century. Land use and land cover (LULC) also changed
   greatly. Our aim was to understand the relationship between LULC and
   fire in the western and eastern ends of the Iberian Central Mountain
   System. We compared two case study landscapes, the Estrela massif and
   the Ayllon massif, which are biophysically similar but with different
   social-ecological contexts. In both, fires were in general more likely
   in shrublands and pastures than in forests. Shrublands replaced forests
   after fires. Contrasting LULC in the two massifs, particularly pastures,
   likely explained the differences in fire occurrence, and reflected
   different regional land use policies and history. Fire here is a
   social-ecological system, influenced by specific LULC and with
   implications from landscape to regional scales. Understanding how LULC
   changes interact with fire is powerful for improving landscape and
   regional planning.},

Abstract = {Aquaculture, and shrimp aquaculture in particular, can have major social

   shrimp aquaculture operations in northwestern Sri Lanka using a case
   study approach. These shrimp farms were individually owned by small
   producers and managed under local-level rules designed by cooperatives
   (samithi). The common-pool resource of major interest was water for
   aquaculture ponds, obtained from an interconnected water body. We
   evaluated the shrimp farming social-ecological system by using Ostrom's
   design principles for collective action. Key elements of the system
   were: clearly defined boundaries; collaboratively designed crop
   calendar, bottom-up approach involving community associations,
   multi-level governance, and farmers-and-government collaborative
   structures. Together, these elements resolved the excludability and
   subtractability problems of commons by establishing boundary and
   membership rules and collective choice rules.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {This paper uses northern Sweden as a case study of a multi-use
   social-ecological system, in which forestry and reindeer husbandry
   interact as different land use forms in the same area. We aim to
   describe the timeline of main events that have influenced resource use
   in northern Sweden, that is, to attempt a historical profiling of the
   system, and to discuss these trends in the system in terms of adaptive
   cycles and resilience. The study shows that key political decisions have
   created strong path dependencies and a situation in which forestry today
   is characterized by low flexibility and low resilience due to the highly
   optimized harvesting of tree resources. Since forestry is the
   overwhelmingly strongest actor, trends in forestry from the mid-19th
   century forward are, to a large part, driving dynamics in reindeer
   husbandry and environmental protection, resulting in a system of
   interlocking panarchies with large implications for the competing land
   uses.},

Booktitle = {ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING WITH STAKEHOLDERS: THEORY, METHODS, AND
   APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Pages = {127-143},
Abstract = {Approach: This chapter presents fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping as a
   participatory method for modeling social-ecological systems. The
   overview of the method is discussed through its evolution, suitability
   for application in environmental modeling, and examples in environmental
   research.
   Participant Engagement: Fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping facilitates
   interactive stakeholder involvement throughout the entire modeling
   process, offering a possibility for discussion, negotiation, consensus
   building, and social learning.
   Models/Outcomes: Final outcomes are semi-quantitative models
   representing most significant components and their relationships within
   a social-ecological system. These can be used to increase understanding
   of a particular issue, analyze possible changes to the system, and
   project future scenarios, or serve as a communication or perception
   analysis tool.
   Challenges: The results of this semi-quantitative method can only be
   interpreted compared to other components in the model, and cannot be
   taken as absolute real-value outcomes. Also, to overcome possible
   biases, subjectivity, and difficulties in assigning weights to
   interconnections in the model, numerous stakeholders must be involved.},

Abstract = {The Cienaga Grande of Santa Marta is Colombia's largest coastal wetland
   and one of the most important in the Caribbean. In this paper we
   evaluate the complex linkages existing among the social-ecological
   history, provision of ecosystem services and human well-being as
   perceived by local stakeholders. The most critical anthropogenic impacts
   occurred during the last 50 years in the period following the
   construction of the Cienaga-Barranquilla highway. The changes to the
   social-ecological system have severely altered hydrological dynamics,
   reduced mangrove forest coverage and affected the composition of
   fisheries, with direct and indirect effects on the ecosystem services
   provision and on the well-being of the local people. Despite the
   ambitious restoration programmes put in practice during the last two
   decades, the social-ecological impacts of large infrastructure
   developments are visible today. The paper offers insights that can
   improve environmental decision making and promote adaptive governance in
   coastal wetlands.},

Abstract = {Policies at multiple levels pronounce the need to encompass both social
   and ecological systems in governance and management of natural capital
   in terms of resources and ecosystems. One approach to knowledge
   production and learning about landscapes as social-ecological systems is
   to compare multiple case studies consisting of large spaces and places.
   We first review the landscape concepts' biophysical, anthropogenic, and
   intangible dimensions. Second, we exemplify how the different landscape
   concepts can be used to derive measurable variables for different
   sustainability indicators. Third, we review gradients in the three
   dimensions of the term landscape on the European continent, and propose
   to use them for the stratification of multiple case studies of
   social-ecological systems. We stress the benefits of the landscape
   concepts to measure sustainability, and how this can improve
   collaborative learning about development toward sustainability in
   social-ecological systems. Finally, analyses of multiple landscapes
   improve the understanding of context for governance and management.},

Abstract = {Despite striking global change, management to ensure healthy landscapes
   and sustained natural resources has tended to set objectives on the
   basis of the historical range of variability in stationary ecosystems.
   Many social-ecological systems are moving into novel conditions that can
   result in ecological transformation. We present four foundations to
   enable a transition to future-oriented conservation and management that
   increases capacity to manage change. The foundations are to identify
   plausible social-ecological trajectories, to apply upstream and
   deliberate engagement and decision-making with stakeholders, to
   formulate management pathways to desired futures, and to consider a
   portfolio approach to manage risk and account for multiple preferences
   across space and time. We use the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge in
   Alaska as a case study to illustrate how the four foundations address
   common land management challenges for navigating transformation and
   deciding when, where, and how to resist, accept, or direct
   social-ecological change.},

Abstract = {In Cameroon, community forests are frequently presented as a relevant
   option to increase the welfare of rural populations and simultaneously
   improve local governance and forest resources conservation. But apart
   from community forests, rural livelihoods also depend on forest areas,
   designated as `domestic forests' in this article, where local users
   enjoy informal customary rights. The specific contributions of community
   and domestic forests to the evolution of the prevailing socio-ecological
   system are assessed through a diachronic study of a village which is
   located in southern Cameroon. The Sustainable Livelihoods Framework is
   used to compare the progress of this social-ecological system between
   January 2008 and December 2009. The overall evolution of livelihoods was
   found to be positive during that period. In this case study, domestic
   forests and community forests are based on complementary models, which
   are often observed in southern Cameroon. Domestic forests constitute the
   basis of socio-economic development, while community forests might offer
   opportunities for a local-level carbon sequestration payment mechanism.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Although scholars of social-ecological resilience propose unity between
   humans and the natural world, much of this work remains based on
   Cartesian division of mind and body that denies it. We present an
   example of a unified system of resilience thinking shared with us by
   Anishinaabe (Ojibway) elders of Pikangikum First Nation, northwestern
   Ontario. The elders' views of boreal forest disturbance and renewal are
   distinct from western scientific approaches in their recognition of
   agency, the ability to individually express free will in nonhuman beings
   including animals, plants, rocks, and forest fire within their
   landscape. Pikangikum elders perceive that, if relationships based on
   respect, reciprocity, and noninterference are maintained with other
   agents, renewal will continue. The proposition of living landscapes
   composed of diverse nonhuman agents poses challenges to collaboration
   with western worldviews, which view nature largely as mechanistic and
   without moral standing. We suggest that a greater attention to
   nonwestern ontologies can contribute to productive cross-cultural
   partnerships directed toward fostering resilience.},

Abstract = {Public lands fungal management in the United States developed in direct
   response to commercial harvesting in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) in the
   1980s. In the early 2000s, concerns over declining morel mushroom
   abundance in national parks in the greater Washington, DC, region (NCR)
   led to the creation of harvest limits and stimulated research on the
   social-ecological system of morels in that region. In this article we
   compare findings from research on morel harvesting conducted at two
   national parks in the NCR from 2004 to 2007, with fungal management from
   two federal units in the PNW. We find substantial differences in
   existing regulatory policies, historical and cultural harvesting
   practices, and taxonomic and ecological variation in Morchella,
   indicating the need for regionally specific management. To address these
   differences, we recommend a participatory approach incorporating the
   local social-ecological specificities of mushroom harvesting and ecology
   that are missed at coarser spatial and temporal scales.},

Title = {Exploring the relevance of engaging the Orang Asli in Malaysia's forest
   management},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 23},
Abstract = {The positive social and environmental outcomes of involving local and
   indigenous people in environmental management have made their inclusion
   in forest management increasingly considered. However, in Malaysia,
   where indigenous forest-dependent communities, known as the Orang Asli,
   are not yet involved in forest management, their significance needs to
   be empirically recorded. This study aims to investigate the relevance of
   involving the Orang Asli in Malaysia's forest management. The study
   employed a participant observational study at Kampung Tanjung Rambai, an
   Orang Asli settlement located in the Malaysian state of Selangor.
   Dwelling with the community and engaging in their forest-based lives for
   a course of 1 month have managed to capture their current relationships
   with the forest, which were then analyzed to determine their roles as
   meaningful stakeholders. The results show that the community has
   maintained a relationship with their land that may ensure the prudent
   use of resources. Furthermore, their forest-based lives can be regarded
   as small-scale disturbances in the forest ecosystem, which are necessary
   for maintaining resilience.},

Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {737-749},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {We developed a mathematical model with two-way linked socio-ecological
   dynamics to study farmland abandonment and to understand the regimes
   shifts of this socio-ecological system. The model considers that
   migration is a collective behavior socio-economically driven and that
   the ecosystem is dynamic. The model identifies equilibria that vary from
   mass migration, farmland abandonment, and forest regeneration, to no
   migration and forest eradication; partial migration and/or coexistence
   of farmland and forest also constitute possible equilibria. Overall, the
   model reflects farmland abandonment processes observed in the field and
   illustrates the importance of the complex interlinked mechanisms between
   the social and ecological systems determining farmland abandonment, that
   are not evident when approached independently. The model dynamics show
   that the hysteresis on the social dynamics renders regimes shifts
   difficult to reverse, and that this difficulty is accentuated when
   considering the ecological system dynamic. Similar models could be
   applied to other socio-ecological systems to help their management.},

Title = {Mapping multi-scale impacts of deforestation in the Amazonian rainforest
   from 1986 to 2010},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {174-190},
Abstract = {In the Amazonian rainforest, a new and pervasive spatial pattern has
   been created by road paving and the impacts of road paving usually
   extend from a small-scale region to an entire social-ecological system,
   making a multi-scale analysis imperative for thinking through structure,
   function, and dynamics of deforested landscapes. We propose a moving
   window approach to describe the deforestation impacts across multiple
   spatial scales and then illustrate this method with a deforestation
   example in an Amazon tri-national frontier, which provides an excellent
   tri-national deforestation and land change comparision for this work.
   The results indicate that the intensive fragmentation occurs locally,
   while a large part of the study area is still covered by forest. In
   addition, a smaller study was undertaken to further assess deforestation
   impacts, and we found that the cleared areas exhibit strong influences
   beyond the boundaries of itself. In this research, the landscape-based
   representation of deforestation dynamics and their impacts on the larger
   landscape provides important information for forest studies and could be
   included in future conservation programs.},

Abstract = {Mining companies are expected to return land to a stable, productive,
   and self-sustaining condition by rehabilitating degraded areas to also
   deliver social benefits, an essential dimension of sustainable land
   management. This research aimed to develop a framework for mine
   rehabilitation planning based on an integrated analysis of the
   social-ecological system provided by the ecosystem services concept to
   facilitate community engagement and the delivery of social benefits. An
   Ecosystem Services Assessment for Rehabilitation framework was tested at
   two bauxite mines undergoing ecological restoration. The mines are
   operated by the same company in two countries. Key results showed that
   the framework can help companies, regulators, and community members
   alike identify whether biophysical restoration efforts translate into
   key human benefits. Overall the framework provides a means for enhancing
   community engagement to explicitly address social benefits that, with a
   business as usual focus on ecological goals, may not be delivered. The
   ecosystem services concept provides a practical approach to link
   ecological and social outcomes of mine restoration.},

Title = {Knowledge Management Practices and Ecological Restoration of the
   Tropical Dry Forest in Colombia},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Ecological restoration is considered a nature-based solution to reduce
   ecosystem degradation, biodiversity loss, and combat climate change. In
   this sense, the objective of this study was to identify the knowledge
   management practices that are present in an ecological restoration
   process in the tropical dry forest. The empirical study was developed
   using a mixed approach over an area of 11,079 ha in Huila, Colombia. At
   first, the qualitative study was supported by a documentary review and
   participant observation between 2018 and 2020. On the other hand, the
   quantitative study was carried out through the application of the Delphi
   method with the participation of 64 experts. Twenty-two knowledge
   management practices were identified with orientation towards human
   factors, organization, information technologies, strategy, and
   intellectual protection. These findings show that all the knowledge
   management practices identified have an impact on the six components of
   the ecological restoration process (planning, diagnosis, implementation,
   monitoring, participation, and consolidation). Likewise, these practices
   contribute to the generation, transformation, and mobilization of local
   and scientific knowledge in the components of the ecological restoration
   process of the tropical dry forest.},

Abstract = {The presented contribution in its first part summarizes several
   important theoretical findings of the system ecology supporting
   non-equilibrium paradigm of complex adaptive systems. We emphasise the
   concept of non-equilibrium thermodynamics of living systems and the
   Honing's adaptive cycle of a social-ecological system. In natural
   forests, the phases of an adaptive cycle fit to a substantial extent
   also to stages and phases of a large and a small forest cycle, although
   there is a different terminology. Further, we have emphasised the
   natural role of disturbances and their explanation from the
   thermodynamic point of view - as an important component of an adaptive
   cycle, which supports conclusions that these natural phenomena not only
   participated in the evolution of the whole habitats, but from the
   long-term view, they may even increase the resilience and overall
   ecological stability of ecosystems. Finally, we have tried to apply the
   findings of the theories presented to derive or underlie several
   principles of the management of temperate deciduous and mixed natural
   forests, which we consider important.},

Abstract = {Understanding the regime shifts of Social-Ecological Systems (SES) and
   their local effects and driving factors over a long period of time is
   significant for future sustainability. We provide a perspective on the
   processes unfolding over time in order to identify the regime shifts of
   an SES based on changes in the relationships between the SES components.
   In addition, we investigate their driving factors and local effects. The
   applicability of this approach is demonstrated by analyzing the
   evolution of the SES in Guizhou Province, China, over the past 600
   years. Six evolutionary phases are identified: the slow expansion of
   cultivation, the rapid expansion of cultivation, the continuous
   expansion of cultivation, the slower expansion of cultivation, the
   transformation of ecological protection driven by returning farmland to
   forest, and green development driven by urbanization. Our study
   establishes the empirical relationship between the state (phase) of the
   SES and its driving factors and effects. This study on the evolution,
   driving factors, and effects of the SES in Guizhou Province, China,
   provides an important reference for long-term regional planning and

Abstract = {Understanding social-ecological system dynamics is a major research
   priority for sustainable management of landscapes, ecosystems and
   resources. But the lack of multi-decadal records represents an important
   gap in information that hinders the development of the research agenda.
   Without improved information on the long-term and complex interactions
   between causal factors and responses, it will be difficult to answer key
   questions about trends, rates of change, tipping points, safe operating
   spaces and pre-impact conditions. Where available long-term monitored
   records are too short or lacking, palaeoenvironmental sciences may
   provide continuous multi-decadal records for an array of ecosystem
   states, processes and services. Combining these records with
   conventional sources of historical information from instrumental
   monitoring records, official statistics and enumerations, remote
   sensing, archival documents, cartography and archaeology produces an
   evolutionary framework for reconstructing integrated regional histories.
   We demonstrate the integrated approach with published case studies from
   Australia, China, Europe and North America.},

Abstract = {Spatially explicit information has become a de-facto standard for the
   analysis of natural systems. However, social science is much slower to
   pick up this approach, and with a few exceptions, governance structures
   are analysed out of the spatial contexts, despite spatial fit issues
   being recognised as central to the study of environmental institutions.
   Another problem arising from the limited use/low awareness of spatial
   analysis tools is that studies of social-ecological systems are rarely
   done consistently for a large area; instead they tend to rely on case
   studies that are often chosen for their idiosyncrasies. As a result, our
   knowledge of social-ecological systems is somewhat distorted. This study
   provides an account of quantitative and qualitative spatially-explicit
   analyses of a resource governance system, and in doing so offers a
   methodology for integrating biophysical and institutional dimensions of
   a social-ecological system in the evaluation of its adaptability. The
   focus is on forest systems, the scale is a nation (Belarus) and the unit
   of analysis is a square kilometre forest patch. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The multiple effects of ecosystem restoration programmes deserve
   attention. After reviewing the social-ecological effects of 23 ecosystem
   restoration programs in Asia's drylands, we find that these programmes
   mainly contribute to sustainable development goals (SDGs)
   synergistically, but the trade-offs between social-ecological effects
   still exist. Among the five goals of SDG15 (Life on Land), SDG13
   (Climate Action), SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG1 (No poverty),
   and SDG2 (Zero Hunger), 11 programs can synergistically achieve no less
   than three goals, especially grassland restoration and water diversion
   in China, as well as water management programmes in Israel. However, the
   contribution of ecosystem restoration programs to SDG15 easily weakens
   SDG6, SDG1, and SDG2, indicating the competition of land and water
   between ecosystem restoration and agriculture. To reduce the trade-offs
   among SGDs caused by ecosystem restoration, we propose the
   social-ecological system research framework of `Dryland Boundary -
   Water, Food, Energy and Ecosystem Nexus - Meta-coupling - Nature-based
   Solutions' to guide the implementation of ecosystem restoration
   programmes from four aspects: supply-demand matching, element matching,
   regional matching, and local adaptation.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the historical development of the southwest
   coastal region of Bangladesh through the lens of human-delta
   co-evolutionary system. The change process of social and
   hydro-ecological systems is described based on the
   drivers-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework. The multiple
   physical and socio-economic drivers such as climatic change, upstream
   development, geologic process, land use change-affected river flow,
   salinity, water logging and cyclones are creating adverse impacts on
   ecology (e.g. mangrove forest) and society (e.g. population migration).
   Existing management practices such as the Coastal Embankment project
   (CEP) also created adverse impacts on social-ecological system. In
   addition to the geology of this region that plays the major role in the
   delta development process, human interventions such as large coastal
   development projects have intervened the land formation processes. The
   trends and impacts of these changes along the coast unfold the necessity
   of integrated management approach such as Integrated Water Resources
   Management (IWRM) and Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM).
   Comprehensive understanding of social and hydro-ecological system in
   southwest coastal region through DPSIR approach presented in this study
   can provide effective solution for implementing ongoing management
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Subsistence harvesting and wild food production by Athabascan peoples is
   part of an integrated social-ecological system of interior Alaska. We
   describe effects of recent trends and future climate change projections
   on the boreal ecosystem of interior Alaska and relate changes in
   ecosystem services to Athabascan subsistence. We focus primarily on
   moose, a keystone terrestrial subsistence resource of villages in that
   region. Although recent climate change has affected the boreal forest,
   moose, and Athabascan moose harvesting, a high dependence by village
   households on moose persists. An historical account of 20th century
   socioeconomic changes demonstrates that the vulnerability of Athabascan
   subsistence systems to climatic change has in some respects increased
   while at the same time has improved aspects of village resilience. In
   the face of future climate and socioeconomic changes, communities have
   limited but potentially effective mitigation and adaptation
   opportunities. The extent to which residents can realize those
   opportunities depends on the responsiveness of formal and informal
   institutions to local needs. For example, increases in Alaska's urban
   population coupled with climate-induced habitat shifts may increase
   hunting conflicts in low-moose years. This problem could be mitigated
   through adaptive co-management strategies that project future moose
   densities and redirect urban hunters to areas of lower conflict.},

Abstract = {Fevers of unknown origin complicate treatment and prevention of
   infectious diseases and are a global health burden. We examined risk
   factors of self-reported fever-categorized as ``malarial{''} and
   ``nonmalarial{''}-in households adjacent to national parks across the
   Ugandan Albertine Rift, a biodiversity and emerging infectious disease
   hotspot. Statistical models fitted to these data suggest that perceived
   nonmalarial fevers of unknown origin were associated with more frequent
   direct contact with wildlife and with increased distance from parks
   where wildlife habitat is limited to small forest fragments. Perceived
   malarial fevers were associated with close proximity to parks but were
   not associated with direct wildlife contact. Self-reported fevers of any
   kind were not associated with livestock ownership. These results suggest
   a hypothesis that nonmalarial fevers in this area are associated with
   wildlife contact, and further investigation of zoonoses from wildlife is
   warranted. More generally, our findings of land use-disease
   relationships aid in hypothesis development for future research in this
   social-ecological system where emerging infectious diseases
   specifically, and rural public health provisioning generally, are

Title = {Multiple social and environmental factors affect wildland fire response
   of full or less-than-full suppression},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {351},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Wildland fire incident commanders make wildfire response decisions
   within an increasingly complex socioenvironmental context. Threats to
   human safety and property, along with public pressures and agency
   cultures, often lead commanders to emphasize full suppression. However,
   commanders may use less-than-full suppression to enhance responder
   safety, reduce firefighting costs, and encourage beneficial effects of
   fire. This study asks: what management, socioeconomic, environmental,
   and fire behavior characteristics are associated with full suppression
   and the less-than-full suppression methods of point-zone protection,
   confinement/ containment, and maintain/monitor? We analyzed incident
   report data from 374 wildfires in the United States northern Rocky
   Mountains between 2008 and 2013. Regression models showed that full
   suppression was most strongly associated with higher housing density and
   earlier dates in the calendar year, along with non-federal land
   jurisdiction, regional and national incident management teams,
   human-caused ignitions, low fire-growth potential, and greater fire
   size. Interviews with commanders provided decision-making context for
   these regression results. Future efforts to encourage less-than-full
   suppression should address the complex management context, in addition
   to the biophysical context, of fire response.},

Title = {Robustness of norm-driven cooperation in the commons},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {283},
Number = {1822},
Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {Sustainable use of common-pool resources such as fish, water or forests
   depends on the cooperation of resource users that restrain their
   individual extraction to socially optimal levels. Empirical evidence has
   shown that under certain social and biophysical conditions,
   self-organized cooperation in the commons can evolve. Global change,
   however, may drastically alter these conditions. We assess the
   robustness of cooperation to environmental variability in a stylized
   model of a community that harvests a shared resource. Community members
   follow a norm of socially optimal resource extraction, which is enforced
   through social sanctioning. Our results indicate that both resource
   abundance and a small increase in resource variability can lead to
   collapse of cooperation observed in the no-variability case, while
   either scarcity or large variability have the potential to stabilize it.
   The combined effects of changes in amount and variability can reinforce
   or counteract each other depending on their size and the initial level
   of cooperation in the community. If two socially separate groups are
   ecologically connected through resource leakage, cooperation in one can
   destabilize the other. These findings provide insights into possible
   effects of global change and spatial connectivity, indicating that there
   is no simple answer as to their effects on cooperation and sustainable
   resource use.},

Title = {Examining fire-prone forest landscapes as coupled human and natural

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Fire-prone landscapes are not well studied as coupled human and natural
   systems (CHANS) and present many challenges for understanding and
   promoting adaptive behaviors and institutions. Here, we explore how
   heterogeneity, feedbacks, and external drivers in this type of natural
   hazard system can lead to complexity and can limit the development of
   more adaptive approaches to policy and management. Institutions and
   social networks can counter these limitations and promote adaptation. We
   also develop a conceptual model that includes a robust characterization
   of social subsystems for a fire-prone landscape in Oregon and describe
   how we are building an agent-based model to promote understanding of
   this social-ecological system. Our agent-based model, which incorporates
   existing ecological models of vegetation and fire and is based on
   empirical studies of landowner decision-making, will be used to explore
   alternative management and fire scenarios with land managers and various
   public entities. We expect that the development of CHANS frameworks and
   the application of a simulation model in a collaborative setting will
   facilitate the development of more effective policies and practices for
   fire-prone landscapes.},

Volume = {70},

Abstract = {The Earth's population will become more than 80\% urban during this
   century. This threshold is often regarded as sufficient justification
   for pursuing urban ecology. However, pursuit has primarily focused on
   building empirical richness, and urban ecology theory is rarely
   discussed. The Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) has been grounded in
   theory since its inception and its two decades of data collection have
   stimulated progress toward comprehensive urban theory. Emerging urban
   ecology theory integrates biology, physical sciences, social sciences,
   and urban design, probes interdisciplinary frontiers while being founded
   on textbook disciplinary theories, and accommodates surprising empirical
   results. Theoretical growth in urban ecology has relied on refined
   frameworks, increased disciplinary scope, and longevity of
   interdisciplinary interactions. We describe the theories used by BES
   initially, and trace ongoing theoretical development that increasingly
   reflects the hybrid biological-physical-social nature of the Baltimore
   ecosystem. The specific mix of theories used in Baltimore likely will
   require modification when applied to other urban areas, but the
   developmental process, and the key results, will continue to benefit
   other urban social-ecological research projects.},

Title = {Uncovering the political dimension of social-ecological systems:
   Contributions from policy process frameworks},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {40},
Pages = {13-25},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Research on the governance of social-ecological systems often emphasizes
   the need for self-organized, flexible and adaptive arrangements to deal
   with uncertainty, abrupt change and surprises that are characteristic of
   social-ecological systems. However, adaptive governance as well as
   transitions toward alternative forms of governance are embedded in
   politics and it is often the political processes that determine change
   and stability in governance systems and policy. This paper analyses five
   established theoretical frameworks of the policy process originating in
   political science and public policy research with respect to their
   potential to enhance understanding of governance and complex policy
   dynamics in social-ecological systems. The frameworks are found to be
   divergent in their conceptualization of policy change (focusing on
   incremental or large-scale, major changes), highlighting different
   aspects of bounded rationality in their model of individual behavior and
   focusing their attention on different aspects of the policy process
   (role of information, attention, beliefs, institutional structure,
   particular actors, etc.). We discuss the application of these frameworks
   and their potential contribution, to unravelling the political dimension
   in adaptive governance and transformations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {The Traditional Technological Approach and Social Technologies in the
   Brazilian Semiarid Region},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {There are different technological approaches to deal with the
   social-ecological adversities found in the Brazilian Semiarid region
   (BSA). They vary according to the interpretation of what the roots of
   these adversities and the causes of the resulting vulnerability are.
   This paper analyses two technological approaches to the BSA, the first
   provided by the government through public policies and the other driven
   by civil society. It focuses on the initiatives promoted by each
   approach during the 20th and 21st centuries, and discusses how they have
   enhanced or reduced the sustainability of the Brazilian Semiarid region.
   This assessment is based on document analysis, fieldwork and
   open/semi-structured interviews. The traditional technological approach
   did not reduce the social-ecological vulnerability of the BSA system or
   increase resilience of family farmers and of the deciduous forest, the
   most vulnerable parties. It has boosted development from a classical
   development perspective, promoting macro-infrastructure and growth, but
   also contributed to keep the same pattern of dependence of farmers.
   Social technologies have been promoting the BSA sustainability and can
   have a long-lasting impact if extensively applied. While the traditional
   approach mostly benefits large landowners, social technologies benefit
   family farmers, the deciduous forest and the entire social-ecological
   system.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Shade-grown coffee is an important reservoir for tropical biodiversity,
   but habitat quality hinges on decisions made by farmers. Our research
   aims to investigate the link between coffee producers' decisions and
   outcomes for biodiversity, using epiphytes as our focal group. Using
   qualitative methods, we interviewed 33 producers in northern Nicaragua
   to understand how they connect trees and epiphytes on their farms to
   ecosystem services and how personal values, access to agronomic
   expertise, labor supply, and financial stability influence
   decision-making. We used interview responses to construct six producer
   typologies. Most producers had strong positive attitudes toward trees
   and associated them with a variety of important ecosystem services.
   Smallholders were more likely to connect trees with provisioning
   services, while producers on larger farms and with greater agronomic
   knowledge emphasized regulating services. Most producers connected
   epiphytes primarily with aesthetic values. Across demographics,
   producers emphasized the restorative potential for shade coffee in
   repairing damage to soil, water, and nutrient cycles caused by other
   forms of agriculture. The conservation significance and sustainability
   of this social-ecological system can be maintained and expanded through
   economic and capacity-building conservation interventions, especially
   when those can be connected to values already held by farmers.},

   Southern Luzon, Philippines},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-13},
Abstract = {Social-ecological transitions in the silvopastoral system of San Isidro,
   Rosario, Batangas, Philippines were analyzed using land cover trends and
   community perceptions. A combination of remote sensing processing,
   randomized survey, and participatory approaches were conducted. Four of
   six land cover categories (forests/ orchards, grasslands, crop.fields
   and water bodies) were identified to be sources of ecosystem services in
   the landscape which are essentialfor cattle farming. In 2000, the
   landscape became an on-fbrin research site on cattlefarming. Coupled
   with other social factors such as land privatization and infrastructure
   development, this has reshaped land cover changes over time. In
   response, cattle farming dynamics, especially during critical dry
   periods, have adapted through measures such as switching to greater
   supplementation of commercialfeeds. Despite social-ecological
   transitions, the cattlebased silvopastoral system in the landscape has
   persisted by exhibiting key principles of resilience such as diversity,
   connectivity, andfeedback management. However, concerns on Arther
   impacts ofkey issues (e.g., landprivatization) should be addressed to
   sustain the cattle-based silvopastoral system in the landscape. This
   study provides critical insights on how natural resource management by
   communities andpolicies by decision makers should carefully consider
   their potential impacts in sustaining locally important ecosystem
   services in the face of rapidly transitioning social-ecological systems.},

Title = {A social contract with the ancestors-Culture and ecosystem services in

Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {251-264},

Abstract = {We investigate the role of culture in sustaining essential ecosystem
   services in the arid and erratic climate of an agropastoral landscape in
   southern Madagascar. Our fieldwork and interviews in Ambovombe
   subprefecture in Androy addressed land use, agropastoralism, livelihood,
   institutions and their moral basis. Our analysis points to the
   interdependence of cultural practices and ecosystem services: sacred
   forests, crop pollination, subsistence farming, cattle economy and
   societal transition and purification rituals. We posit a
   social-ancestral contract that works as a moral attractor structuring
   and sustaining the agropastoral ecosystem services system. The contract
   between living and nonliving clan members underpins the cultural
   practices and rituals that regulate the vulnerable agropastoral system.
   We conclude that the well-being values of the inhabitants of the south
   of Madagascar depend upon moralities that lend legitimacy and stability
   to the management of the social-ecological processes that precondition
   ecosystem services production. Neither ecosystem nor culture delivers
   ecosystem services to society. Ecosystem services are generated by an
   interdependent social-ecological system in which knowledge, practice,
   and beliefs coevolve: culture is a key factor in their generation and
   persistence. The study suggests these are significant interdependences
   to consider in dynamic analyses of ecosystem service production. (C)

Abstract = {We investigate the perceptions and impacts of climate change on 11
   Indigenous communities in Northern British Columbia and Southeast
   Alaska. This coastal region constitutes an extremely dynamic and
   resilient social-ecological system where Indigenous Peoples have been
   adjusting to changing climate and biodiversity for millennia. The region
   is a bellwether for biodiversity changes in coastal, forest, and montane
   environments that link the arctic to more southerly latitudes on the
   Pacific coast. Ninety-six Elders and resource users were interviewed to
   record Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and observations regarding
   weather, landscape, and resource changes, especially as concerns what we
   term Cultural Keystone Indicator Species (CKIS), which provide a unique
   lens into the effects of environmental change. Our findings show that
   Indigenous residents of these communities are aware of significant
   environmental changes over their lifetimes, and an acceleration in
   changes over the last 15-20 years, not only in weather patterns, but
   also in the behaviour, distributions, and availability of important
   plants and animals. Within a broader ecological and social context of
   dwelling, we suggest ways this knowledge can assist communities in
   responding to future environmental changes using a range of place-based
   adaptation modes.},

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {The human impact on nature has now reached a level at which the
   well-being of future human society is at risk. Therefore, transformative
   change in society is needed. Environmental assessments contribute to
   shaping environmental policy, potentially leveraging transformative
   change. Red Lists are a key information source on the state of
   biodiversity. Our aim was to study the Red List authors' perceptions of
   how Red Lists contribute to leveraging sustainability changes. We
   interviewed 15 of the authors of the forest and peatland sections of the
   Finnish Red List of Ecosystems 2018. We used the framework of
   sustainability leverage points to locate sustainability changes that Red
   Lists have leveraged in the social part of the Finnish social-ecological
   system. Our results show how the assessors perceived the influence of
   the Red Lists at most of the leverage points, including the deepest
   ones, and how these influences simultaneously co-exist in several
   leverage points. The most prominent sustainability changes were linked
   with legislation and information flows, whereas current paradigms,
   system goals and legislation appeared to prevent Red Lists from
   leveraging sustainability changes in Finland. We conclude that the
   production and dissemination processes of Red List knowledge can make an
   important contribution to sustainability changes.},

Abstract = {An integrated approach to understanding ecosystem service values in
   Wyoming and Montana, USA is presented. The assessment encompasses a
   major river basin, and includes a synthesis of existing data and
   research related to the natural system and separate data collection
   efforts regarding the social and economic importance of ecosystem
   services. A holistic look at the social-ecological system provides
   nuanced information about ecosystem service values and tradeoffs for the
   purpose of public land decision-making.
   The initial ecological assessment concluded that water resources were
   particularly vulnerable, which guided the social and economic
   assessments. The social assessment applied Q-methodology, ultimately
   identifying and exploring four archetypes regarding views on the
   importance of 34 ecosystem services, which were dubbed
   ``environmental{''}, ``agricultural{''}, ``Native American{''}, and
   ``recreation{''}. The economic assessment applied choice modeling to
   understand non-market values of ecosystem services (i.e., agricultural
   community, aquatic biodiversity, river angling, and motorized winter
   recreation), and latent class analysis provided insight into preference
   heterogeneity previously indicated in the social assessment. The
   structured approach can inform natural resource decision-making by
   including several different perspectives, integrating multiple spatial
   scales, highlighting particular ecosystem services as relevant within
   the context of many ecosystem services, and facilitating relations
   between the public and natural resource stewards.},

Title = {Assessing the potential of REDD plus in a production mangrove forest in
   Malaysia using stakeholder analysis and ecosystem services mapping},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {74},
Pages = {6-17},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Mangrove forests are ecologically important and carbon-rich coastal
   ecosystems that provide direct and indirect livelihood support for
   coastal communities. In recent years there has been increased discussion
   in the policy and scientific communities over how to include mangrove
   forests in climate change mitigation initiatives such as REDD+. There
   are a number of challenges to establishing a successful REDD+ project in
   mangrove areas, with land tenure and stakeholder entitlements arguably
   the most challenging. This study examines how REDD+ approaches might be
   applied to better balance timber production and conservation objectives
   in the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR), a 40,466 ha mangrove
   forest area in Malaysia. Stakeholder profiles and needs are linked with
   ecosystem services to develop an integrated profile of this complex
   social-ecological system, which has been managed for timber production
   for more than 100 years, and has recently revealed evidence of declining
   ecosystem health. The results provide insights into how REDD+ might be
   operationalised in existing forest areas with traditions of multiple
   uses, potentially contributing to improved social-ecological outcomes
   for forests and their diverse stakeholders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Community resilience, the capacity of a community to adapt to change in
   ways that result in positive impacts on its well-being, is increasingly
   used as a framework for understanding and enhancing the sustainability
   of forest-dependent communities as social ecological systems. However,
   studies linking community resilience to the implementation of forest
   management programs are limited. This study uses community resilience
   literature and analyzes data collected from interviews to study barriers
   of forest-dependent communities of collaborative forest management (CFM)
   in two forest-dependent communities in the Ashanti region of Ghana.
   Analysis revealed the barriers in community response to CFM programs in
   these two communities comprise institutional shortfalls in the design
   and implementation of the CFM program that have constrained the
   incentives, capacity and opportunities for communities to successfully
   adapt to the program. The paper offers recommendations on how the CFM
   program can contribute to building the resilience of communities in
   managing their forests. The first is to build institutional capacity of
   communities to play an active role in forest governance, and the second
   is the prioritization of well-being and livelihood enhancement as forest
   management goals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Nature Reserve, China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},

Abstract = {Conflicts between humans and Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) are
   widespread in Asia and pose challenges to human-bear coexistence.
   Identifying effective mitigation measures requires a thorough
   understanding of human-bear conflicts (HBC). We assessed
   spatial-temporal patterns of HBC and their impact factors around the
   Baoshan Section of the Gaoligongshan Nature Reserve (GNNR) between 2012
   and 2020. The results suggested that crop raiding by bears occurred most
   commonly, followed by beehive loss, livestock depredation, and human
   casualties. HBC hotspots occurred near the protected area where local
   people frequently encountered bears. The landscapes with lower elevation
   and human density were at higher risk of HBC. Furthermore, villages with
   more fragmented forests or less fragmented croplands were more
   vulnerable to HBC. The differences in agricultural structures
   contributed to the diverse composition of HBC between the two regions.
   In addition, crop raiding by bears decreased significantly, probably due
   to the changing landscape composition and configuration derived from
   human behaviors, yet livestock depredation and beehive loss increased.
   Our findings indicated the complex interrelationship between the
   environment, bears, and humans, which could guide the implementation of
   mitigation measures. We recommend multiple approaches based on a
   social-ecological system to mitigate HBC.},

Title = {The Mangal Play: A serious game to experience multi-stakeholder
   decision-making in complex mangrove social-ecological systems},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 24},
Abstract = {In order to achieve collaborative action in nature conservation and
   natural resources management, stakeholders have to understand and
   acknowledge other stakeholders' interests, values, world visions and
   objectives and they have to overcome the problem of irrational
   decision-making through innate opposition discourses. In this paper we
   developed the Mangal Play, an experiential learning method to have
   participants adopt the role of a particular stakeholder in an imaginary
   mangrove forest social-ecological system (SES). The Mangal Play is a
   serious game, more specifically a role-play, aimed at promoting oral
   dialogues between 20 stakeholders involved in governance, fisheries,
   aquaculture, agriculture, forestry, tourism, transport, conservation and
   communication sectors. By providing tools to lecturers and scientists to
   execute it in a public or classroom setting, the Mangal Play stimulates
   a decision-making process while accepting compromise and distinguishing
   bottom-line issues from negotiable positions, and instructs about the
   behaviour of complex real-world systems in a safe learning environment.
   We exemplify how social network analysis can serve to visualise the
   outcome and further develop the Mangal Play. In this way we hope to help
   stakeholders take into account diverse positions in a rational
   decision-making process.},

   set of system attributes changed over time, and what drivers contributed
   to change when it occurred? We simultaneously examined a set of three
   propositions relating to drivers and dynamics of policy change. We find
   that factors contributing to the level of impacts, like technology,
   changed substantially over time and had dramatic impacts. In partial
   contrast, the institutions used to exercise control (patterns of agency
   and governance) remained the same until relatively recently. Other
   system attributes remained unchanged (e.g., the concept of ecosystems as
   stable entities that humans can manage and control). Substantive,
   decision-relevant uncertainties characterized all periods of management
   but did not act as a barrier to the adoption of new regimes at any time.
   Against this backdrop of constancy in some attributes, and change in
   others, a few exogenous drivers (e.g., technology, war, markets, legal
   decisions, ideas, and climate) triggered episodic reexamination of
   guidelines for resource management. The implications of these findings
   for future policy change in this system are discussed.},

Abstract = {In this article we extend the theory of community prediction by
   presenting seven hypotheses for predicting community structure in a
   directionally changing world. The first three address well-studied
   community responses to environmental and ecological change: ecological
   communities are most likely to exhibit threshold changes in structure
   when perturbations cause large changes in limiting soil or sediment
   resources, dominant or keystone species, or attributes of disturbance
   regime that influence community recruitment. Four additional hypotheses
   address social-ecological interactions and apply to both ecological
   communities and social-ecological systems. Human responsiveness to
   short-term and local costs and benefits often leads to human actions
   with unintended long-term impacts, particularly those that are far from
   the site of decision making or are geographically dispersed. Policies
   are usually based on past conditions of ecosystem services rather than
   expected future trends. Finally, institutions that strengthen negative
   feedbacks between human actions and social-ecological consequences can
   reduce human impacts through more responsive (and thus more effective)
   management of public ecosystem services. Because of the large role that
   humans play in modifying ecosystems and ecosystem services, it is
   particularly important to test and improve social-ecological hypotheses
   as a basis for shaping appropriate policies for long-term ecosystem
   resilience.},

Abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) are critical for achieving conservation, economic
   and development goals, but the factors that lead households to engage in
   prohibited resource collection in PAs are not well understood. We
   examine collection behaviours in community forests and the protected
   Chitwan National Park in Chitwan, Nepal. Our approach incorporates
   household and ecological data, including structured interviews,
   spatially explicit data on collection behaviours measured with computer
   tablets and a systematic field survey of invasive species. We pair our
   data with a framework that considers factors related to a household's
   demand for resources, barriers to prohibited resource collection,
   barriers to legal resource collection and alternatives to resource
   collection. The analysis identifies key drivers of prohibited
   collection, including sociodemographic variables and perceptions of an
   invasive plant (Mikania micrantha). The social-ecological systems
   approach reveals that household perceptions of the presence of M.
   micrantha were more strongly associated with resource collection
   decisions than the actual ecologically measured presence of the plant.
   We explore the policy implications of our findings for PAs and propose
   that employing a social-ecological systems approach leads to
   conservation policy and scientific insights that are not possible to
   achieve with social or ecological approaches alone.},

Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Understand the effects of context-specific conditions on incentives,
   social interactions, and the likelihood of local organization is
   critical in supporting the sustainable management of collective tropical
   forests. In this vein, this study sought to analyze the causal
   relationships between factors in the context of the central rainforest
   of the Colombian Pacific that create barriers to local communities'
   cooperation in commercial logging management and control. The
   Socio-ecological Systems Analysis Framework was used and fed with
   information from a literature review and 24 interviews conducted with
   key informants in the area. We found that the mechanisms formally
   established for administering and managing collective forests have
   failed to encourage user cooperation and have ineffective control of
   free access to the increasingly scarce forest resource. We were able to
   identify and explain the causal importance of seven local context
   variables concerning the generation of disincentives to cooperation. The
   variables were: forest area extent, representative mechanisms in place,
   formulation and relevance of resource use and management regulations,
   appropriation by local institutions, timber trade intermediaries, low
   socioeconomic development, and multilevel forest management hierarchies.
   The results of this study hope also to help identify more effective
   strategies to directly involve local communities and engage them in the
   management and control of collective tropical forests.},

Title = {Enhancing feasibility: Incorporating a socio-ecological systems
   framework into restoration planning},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {83-92},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Forest restoration is the counterforce to deforestation. In many parts
   of the world it mitigates forest loss and degradation, but success rates
   vary. Socio-political variables are important predictors of
   effectiveness of restoration activities, indicating that restoration
   strategies need to be locally adapted. Yet, contextual assessments of
   the biophysical, social and political characteristics of forest
   restoration are rare. Here, we integrate a social-ecological systems
   framework with systematic decision-making to inform forest restoration
   planning. We illustrate this approach through a prioritization analysis
   in a community-based forest restoration context in Paser District, East
   Kalimantan, Indonesia. We compare the solutions of our integrated
   framework with those identified on the basis of biophysical criteria
   alone. We discover that incorporating a socio-political context alters
   the selection of priority areas. While the social feasibility and
   political permissibility can be enhanced, ecological benefits are likely
   to be reduced and/or opportunity costs of alternative land uses are to
   be increased. Our conceptual framework allows the appraisal of potential
   trade-offs between social and ecological outcomes of alternative
   options, and has the potential to evaluate the efficiency of existing
   policies. Empirical testing in a range of contexts is required to ensure
   broad applicability and transferability of our conceptual framework. (C)

Abstract = {We explored how the forest-dwelling Soliga community of South India
   views and explains biological invasions, and how local knowledge can
   inform scientific knowledge on biological invasions. We used an
   interview schedule with open-ended questions to solicit Soliga opinion
   on Lantana camara (lantana) invasion. The Soliga cited three reasons for
   lantana spread: its prolific fruit output and wide seed dispersal,
   change in fire management, and historical extraction of grass and
   bamboo. The Soliga believe that lantana invasion has had negative
   effects on the ecosystem and their livelihoods. Tabling scientific
   knowledge with local knowledge has improved our understanding of lantana
   invasion. The role of existing lantana in colonizing neighboring areas,
   and the response of native tree communities to lantana were common to
   both local and scientific sources. However, the Soliga view provides a
   more nuanced perspective of the lantana-fire relationship (contextually
   based on lantana density) with fires suppressing lantana when lantana
   density was low. This is contrary to views held by foresters and
   biologists, that fires are uniformly detrimental and promote lantana.
   Our study shows that examining Soliga observations has improved
   understanding of the invasion process and presents avenues for future
   lantana management.},

   Implications for Social-Ecological Resilience},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Our review highlights how traditional ecological knowledge influences
   people's adaptive capacity to social-ecological change and identifies a
   set of mechanisms that contribute to such capacity in the context of
   community-based biodiversity conservation initiatives. Twenty-three
   publications, including twenty-nine case studies, were reviewed with the
   aim of investigating how local knowledge, community-based conservation,
   and resilience interrelate in social-ecological systems. We highlight
   that such relationships have not been systematically addressed in
   regions where a great number of community conservation initiatives are
   found; and we identify a set of factors that foster people's adaptive
   capacity to social-ecological change and a number of social processes
   that, in contrast, undermine such capacity and the overall resilience of
   the social-ecological system. We suggest that there is a need to further
   investigate how climate variability and other events affect the joint
   evolution of conservation outcomes and traditional ecological knowledge,
   and there is a need to expand the current focus on social factors to
   explain changes in traditional ecological knowledge and adaptive
   capacity towards a broader approach that pays attention to ecosystem

Title = {Positive dependency and virtuous cycles: From resource dependence to

Abstract = {We argue that purely deficit-based perspectives regarding urban
   social-ecological systems (SES) and the human populations within them
   represent barriers to these systems' ability to move from undesirable
   system states into more desirable, sustainable ones. We characterize
   issues such as individual ecological identity, human exemptionalism,
   anthropocentrism, and resource dependence. We examine notions found in
   the resource dependency literature, where we trace the roots of ideas
   about dependency. We use this literature as a spring board into the
   possibilities of an antipodal notion of resource dependency potentially
   applicable in urban contexts, what we call positive dependency. Next we
   describe two possible sources of positive dependency in urban SES,
   urgent biophilia and restorative topophilia, followed by a brief
   discussion applying positive dependence to urban systems challenges and
   management. We conclude with the importance of recognition of positive
   dependency as a precursor to the development of a heightened sense of
   ecological self and sense of ecological place in urban SES, and provide
   insights and suggestions for further research into civic ecology
   practices that may enhance positive dependency on and investment in
   ecological assets that contribute to positive ecological senses of self
   and place, and the importance of these to achieving sustainable,
   resilient urban futures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Urban forest ecosystems are increasingly recognized as necessary
   components of a city's overall sustainability. The number of municipal
   governments planning and implementing urban forest management programs
   is rising, as the benefits of urban forest ecosystems are becoming
   common knowledge. However, the urban forest is an exceedingly complex
   and vulnerable social-ecological system that presents a wide array of
   management challenges. One area of concern that is understudied and
   worthy of investigation is the effects of housing renovation activities
   and neighborhood revitalization on the urban forest. The purpose of this
   study is to investigate the possibility of renovation activity as a
   significant source of disturbance in urban forest ecosystems. We
   conducted ordinary least squares regression and geographically weighted
   regression analyses using canopy cover, building permit data, and
   socioeconomic variables in Toronto, Canada. We then conducted a
   parcel-level assessment of tree mortality using ortho-imagery from 2003
   and 2014 and government open data describing 16 years of renovation
   activity. Findings suggest that renovation activity, as indicated by
   building permit abundance, is a possible cause of tree mortality and
   subsequently a source of urban forest disturbance. Our findings also
   suggest that the relationship between renovation activity and canopy
   cover is highly complex, and is likely influenced by residential tree
   planting rates, land use mix, and different trajectories of urban
   change.},

   social-ecological system in Southwest China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {China's recent collective forest tenure reform (CFTR) aims to improve
   forest conditions by devolution of forest management rights from
   community collectives to individual households. Studies reveal
   substantial local variation in CFTR implementation, but the ecological
   effects and underlying mechanism have received little attention. Our
   study focused on community-managed forests and household-managed forests
   in four communities located in the mountains of Southwest China. The
   objective was to investigate the relationship between CFTR and forest
   conditions at the local scale. We employed a combination of remote
   sensing technology, field forest observations and socioeconomic surveys
   to gather data for analysis. The results showed that the forest cover
   change trends of collective forests and household forests in each
   community were consistent from 1994 to 2014. There was no significant
   relationship between CFTR implementation and local-level differences in
   species diversity and soil fertility in forests. The aboveground biomass
   of collective forests was significantly higher than that of household
   forests. Differentiated access and use, low compensation amounts, and
   loose payment terms jointly affected CFTR's effectiveness to improve
   local-scale forest conditions in the study area. Attempts to formalize
   forest tenure rights must be flexible enough and adapted to the local
   environment so that changes induced by the CFTR can improve local access
   to forest resources and its benefits.},

   Administrative Region, Philippines},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},

Pages = {85-95},
Abstract = {Tree farming is becoming infamous among smallholders in the Caraga
   Administrative Region, the acclaimed ``timber corridor{''} ofthe
   Philippines. Despite the region's favorable biophysical condition to
   tree farming, attractive Cash benefits, and market availability compared
   to other regions of the country, tree farming has become less attractive
   to smallholders. The smallholders remainedpoor and marginalized even as
   the region's poverty incidence continually declined in the last three
   decades. This study seeks to determine the socioeconomic impacts of
   sinallholder tree farming in the region. Using both qualitative and
   quantitative analyses, the study revealed that tree and non-tree farmers
   alike perceived positive and statistically significant changes on
   livelihood sources, income, equity, asset accumulation, education, level
   of trust, reciprocity and cohesiveness in the community as a result of
   tree farming. However, although income was improved with tree farming,
   benefits were considered inequitable among different stakeholders; those
   endowed with financial capital captured much of the economic benefits.
   Worse, the lack offinancial resources has led some smallholder tree
   farmers to accommodate arrangements such as dependence on the purchase
   order (PO) holders who have control over the price oflogs that put them
   into a disadvantaged situation, which consequently locked them in
   impoverished condition. The study recommends the institutionalization
   ofan effective need-oriented extension programfor smallholder tree
   farmers, investment in market diversification and vertical integration
   of tree products to make smallholder tree farming more sustainable and
   equitable.},

Abstract = {In an indigenous forest community in Palawan, Philippines, honey
   gathering from the giant honey bee (Apis dorsata) is a traditional
   subsistence practice. We characterize the social-ecological dynamics of
   giant honey bees with indigenous peoples of Tagbanua ethnicity using the
   mobile agent-based ecosystem service (MABES) framework. Chemical and
   pollen analysis conducted on honey samples generated data on the
   ecological features of this linked social-ecological system. These were
   supplemented by 251 household surveys and key informant interviews with
   institutional representatives to identify the social and institutional
   features of the system. Honey samples analyzed for pollen showed a total
   of 11 different plant families and did not have any traces of pesticide
   residue. The majority of households interviewed use honey as food,
   medicine, and a saleable commodity. A small percentage of households use
   fertilizers and pesticides known to be harmful to bees. Institutions
   have different knowledge strengths that can be tapped through a
   transdisciplinary approach. As the scale of production and delivery of
   MABES is distinctly a product of the mobility of service-delivering
   organisms, we recommend using a landscape approachwith a focus on
   maintaining the quality of both the local environment and landscapes
   around the site of ES delivery.},

Abstract = {Spatially explicit information on local perceptions of ecosystem
   services is needed to inform land use planning within rapidly changing
   landscapes. In this paper we spatially modelled local people's use and
   perceptions of benefits horn forest ecosystem services in Borneo, horn
   interviews of 1837 people in 185 villages. Questions related to
   provisioning, cultural/spiritual, regulating and supporting ecosystem
   services derived horn forest, and attitudes towards forest conversion.
   We used boosted regression trees (BRTs) to combine interview data with
   social and environmental predictors to understand spatial variation of
   perceptions across Borneo. Our results show that people use a variety of
   products horn intact and highly degraded forests. Perceptions of
   benefits from forests were strongest: in human-altered forest landscapes
   for cultural and spiritual benefits; in human-altered and intact forests
   landscapes for health benefits; intact forest for direct health
   benefits, such as medicinal plants; and in regions with little forest
   and extensive plantations, for environmental benefits, such as climatic
   impacts from deforestation. Forest clearing for small scale agriculture
   was predicted to be widely supported yet less so for large-scale
   agriculture. Understanding perceptions of rural communities in dynamic,
   multi-use landscapes is important where people are often directly
   affected by the decline in ecosystem services. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {A Framework for the Integration of Nature-Based Solutions into
   Environmental Risk Management Strategies},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Mountainous areas are expected to face increasing societal pressure due
   to mass tourism and the rising intensity and frequency of natural
   hazards triggered by climate change. Therefore, the development of
   proper strategies for the management of environmental risks will be
   crucial to ensure their liveability. Against this backdrop, concepts
   such as territorial resilience and Social-Ecological Systems (SES) can
   support the prioritisation of protective efforts. This paper presents a
   conceptual framework to be applied to areas subject to natural hazards.
   Its aim is to support the integration of different measures, with a
   special focus on protection forests and other Nature-based Solutions,
   into current risk management strategies. The framework considers (i) the
   definition of SES boundaries; (ii) the identification of the main goals
   to be achieved; (iii) the quantification of the supply and demand of the
   ecosystem protection service; and (iv) the development of risk
   management strategies able to include the management of protection
   forests among the adopted solutions. This framework is intended as a
   tool to be adopted by local and regional decision-makers as a tool to
   identify the areas at risk, to recognise the potential role of
   protection forests, and to operationalise the concept of resilience
   through the deployment of ``grey-green{''} strategies.},

Title = {Using the Ecosystem Services Concept to Assess Transformation of
   Agricultural Landscapes in the European Alps},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Mountain farming sustains human well-being by providing various
   ecosystem services (ES). In the last decades, socio-economic
   developments have led to worldwide changes in land-use/cover (LULC), but
   the related effects on ES have not been fully explored. This study aimed
   at assessing the impacts of the transformation of agricultural land on
   ES in the European Alps. We mapped 19 ES within the agriculturally used
   areas in the year 2000 and analyzed LULC changes by 2018. We compared
   eight regions with a similar development, regarding social-ecological
   characteristics, to outline contrasting trends. Our results indicate
   that the ES decreased most strongly in regions with a massive
   abandonment of mountain grassland, while ES in the `traditional
   agricultural region' remained the most stable. In regions with an
   intensification of agriculture, together with urban sprawl, ES had the
   lowest values. Across all regions, a shift from ES that are typically
   associated with mountain farming towards forest-related ES occurred, due
   to forest regrowth. By relating differing trends in ES to
   social-ecological developments, we can discuss our findings regarding
   new landscapes and farming systems across the European Alps. Our
   quantitative and spatially explicit findings provide a valuable basis
   for policy development, from the regional to the international/EU level,
   and for adopting sustainable management strategies.},

Title = {The adaptive cycles of woodlands, croplands, rangelands, and fisheries:
   developing a procedure to test the theory},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The theory of adaptive cycles, as developed almost 40 years ago by
   Holling (1986), has great potential as a tool to understand, anticipate,
   and alter the trajectories of change in natural resource systems.
   However, its incorporation in natural resource policy and management
   remains limited. A total of 112 studies are reviewed to assess how the
   theory of adaptive cycles has been applied to understand the behavior of
   natural resource systems (i.e., woodlands, croplands, rangelands, and
   fisheries) and how its application can be improved to enhance the
   potential of the theory to inform natural resource management. The
   review reveals that the theory has largely been applied in haphazard
   ways because there is no procedure in place to prevent the manipulation
   of empirical data to fit the path prescribed by the theory. The theory
   of adaptive cycles is primarily approached as a conceptual framework
   instead of as a set of testable and falsifiable hypotheses. Ill-fitting
   management recommendations can ensue when the theory is not tested,
   which demonstrates the pressing need for the development of a
   standardized procedure that future studies can follow. A 7-step
   procedure is developed to enhance the transparency and reliability of
   the application of the theory of adaptive cycles and to contribute to
   the realization of its potential to inform natural resource management.},

Journal = {ECOSYSTEMS AND PEOPLE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {The concept of ecosystem services (ES) and related conceptual frameworks
   like the cascade model, can be relevant to explore the ways through
   which people and nature are connected and how the benefits of nature,
   upon which people depend, are realised. An integrated cascade framework
   was used to study the ES pathway of pine resin, a traded forest product,
   in a rural mountain community in Mexico. We conducted mixed-methods
   research, combining participatory tools with measures of service
   capacity, resin yield, and key farmer endowments. Resin was co-produced
   by an intricate interaction between the human and natural components of
   the social-ecological system. Substantial human inputs and coordinated
   efforts were required to realise resin benefits, and people's
   appreciation and plural values emerged along the whole service pathway.
   Though there were stark differences in natural resource endowments,
   working farmers gained a high share of resin's income through labour,
   labour relations and social networks. But most social conflicts and
   struggles also occurred over labour relations and organisation,
   revealing power dynamics. Furthermore, external actors controlled
   different mechanisms of access, and exerted power over the community's
   ability to derive benefits from resin. In resin co-production, values
   connect people to the landscape, while labour and power mediate the
   access to nature's benefits.},

Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Adaptation in human and natural systems has received growing attention
   in sustainability scholarship. Co-adaptation, when coupled human and
   natural systems (CHANSs) adapt in congruence, is receiving much less
   attention. Not only are various forms of co-adaptation difficult to
   disentangle, adaptations are also conceptualized very differently by
   scholars of human and natural systems. One aspect of adaptation that
   scholars agree on, however, is that it is first and foremost a change.
   We offer a new transdisciplinary typology of the four most basic types
   of change, internally and externally driven non-structural and
   structural changes, that bridges perspectives in the natural and social
   sciences and through which we introduce new categories of adaptations
   and forms of co-adaptation in CHANSs. We first describe the typology's
   foundations and its four types of change. We then organize forms of
   adaptation in human and natural systems according to the types of change
   they exhibit to identify new categories of adaptations and forms of
   co-adaptation. Finally, we illustrate the application of the new
   categories and forms in a real-world CHANS-the privately managed
   Northwoods in the Upper Midwest, USA. This new typology paves the way
   for robust and cross-disciplinary research on CHANSs.},

Title = {Disentangling the role of management practices on ecosystem services

   trade-offs through expert-based assessment},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {517},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Silvopastoral systems (SPS) emerge with a renewal interest in the
   Mediterranean for their promotion of multifunctionality through a
   variety of ecosystem services (ES). However, the understanding of how
   combined forestry and pastoral practices affect the ES delivery as well
   as the synergies and trade-off dynamics amongst them is still very
   limited. We applied the structured expert consultation Delphi method to
   assess the medium-term effect of relevant silvopastoral management
   practices (SMP) on the delivery of provision, regulation and maintenance
   and cultural ES in Mediterranean mid-mountain SPS in Spain. The
   deliberation process entailed two rounds and the Delphi panel was
   finally formed by 69 experts covering a broad spectrum of background and
   expertise. Results show that some practices, such as silvicultural
   treatments (e.g., thinning or coppice selection), play a multifunctional
   role contributing to ES delivery in bundles while some trade-offs are
   also identified between SMP, such as free animal grazing, and the
   provision of some ES. Synergies are also found between ES, such as
   livestock production and recreational hunting and between timber
   production and carbon sequestration, whereas possible trade-offs were
   particularly relevant between wildfire prevention and carbon
   sequestration. These findings can support decision-making processes
   towards sustainable and multifunctional silvopastoral management in the
   northern Mediterranean basin.},

Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Ecosystem-based disaster management focus on conservation or restoration
   of ecosystem services provided by healthy ecosystems. To be put into
   practice, this approach requires the engagement of different social
   actors in collaborative processes that reduce the risk of disasters. In
   this research, we analyzed the engagement of social actors in the
   restoration of coastal ecosystems after the successive arson fires that
   occurred in 2019 in the Serra do Tabuleiro State Park (STSP), Santa
   Catarina, Brazil. We collected data through documentary research,
   semistructured interviews with participants in an event focused on
   recovering the burnt areas, and participant observation in the
   elaboration of two plans: 1) Forest Fire Fighting Contingency Plan in
   the Baixada do Massiambu, and 2) Action Plan for Ecological Restoration
   of the Baixada do Massiambu. Our results suggest that fires act as a
   trigger for a process of public engagement involving social actors with
   different backgrounds, motivations, and knowledge about the STSP. The
   analyzed plans promote inter-scale articulations between organizations
   aiming the conservation of ecosystems. Public engagement is the result
   of three factors: investment in training and development of projects for
   community mobilization, worsening of power disputes over projects for
   the territory, and media construction of an image of fires in the Amazon
   associated with the disruption of Brazilian environmental policy.},

Abstract = {Food forestsedible, perennial, polyculture systemsare of increasing
   interest in North America and the United Kingdom, as reflected in
   projects ranging from urban food initiatives to integrated conservation
   and restoration planning. To examine emerging food forestry (FF) against
   the backdrop of ecological restoration (ER), we conducted
   semi-structured interviews with eight experts each from the fields of FF
   and ER in conjunction with observations of food forests in Canada, the
   United States, and the United Kingdom. Using content analysis, our study
   builds a FF model that encompasses the underlying goals of emerging
   FFforest function; diversity of yields; education and culture sharing;
   healthy habitats for people and other species; and sustainability. We
   argue that FF has potential as an urban restoration tool in terms of
   enhancing the multifunctionality of heterogeneous landscapes undergoing
   significant changes. This will require meaningful consideration of
   ethical issues (e.g. commodification of nature), landscape contexts,
   ecological integrity, integration of historical knowledge, and
   resilience for interdependent, dynamic social and ecological systems.
   Moreover, systematic, long-term monitoring of different types of food
   forests will be crucial in order to mindfully apply FF in ER. This
   research provides one of the first in-depth analyses of how emerging FF
   might contribute to restoration in the time of the Anthropocene,
   especially outside traditional tropic regions where most FF has been
   practiced.},

Title = {Understanding dynamics of forest ecosystem services governance: A
   socio-ecological-technical-analytical framework},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {55},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Little is known about the emergence and development of novel governance
   approaches for forest ecosystem services provision, what drives them,
   and how they can be fostered. Existing frameworks often deal with single
   aspects of resource management and thus fail to assess processes,
   multi-level influences, and interacting dimensions and factors in a
   system-based understanding. In this article, we introduce the conceptual
   foundation and an empirical application of an adapted Social-Ecological
   System framework with additional elements that builds on the idea of
   complex and interlinked social-ecological-technical-forestry-innovation
   systems that allows for the identification of key factors for revealing
   forest ecosystem services dynamics to understand the emergence and
   development of such governance innovations. The development and testing
   of the framework was based on six case studies for knowledge
   co-creation. To showcase its application, two governance innovations
   were examined: a voluntary carbon market payment scheme in Germany and a
   network approach for forest-pasture management in Italy. The application
   of the framework reveals required adaptations to improve innovation by
   systematically unpacking the system dimensions and identifying fostering
   and hindering factors and their interdependencies. We highlight the
   output of a sound system-based information basis that allows for
   purposeful innovation conditioning by policy makers, practitioners, and
   other related actors.},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to help understand the interaction of rural
   people with tropical dry forests. It was based on social research
   conducted in the Chamela-Cuixmala region, on the Pacific coast of
   Mexico. The analytical tools used in the study included stakeholder
   identification, environmental history and social perceptions. The two
   main social groups in the study were ejidatarios, who own most of the
   territory, and avecindados, who possess no land but have high population
   numbers. Through an interpretative methodological approach we documented
   the vision and meaning that rural people give to their natural and
   social worlds. The agricultural development model promoted by the
   Mexican government for decades was identified as the main driver of
   ecosystem transformation. Rural people, who arrived recently in the
   region, were proud of the pasture-lands that were transformed from
   tropical forests. Conservation policies implemented during the last two
   decades were viewed as impositions although people recognized the value
   of services provided by ecosystems. This case study has helped to
   unravel the main dimensions of the human system and how it relates to
   structures of signification. The social panorama unveiled can be used as
   an initial basis to promote further research on the social-ecological
   system of the Chamela-Cuixmala region and to develop future
   participatory management schemes.},

Title = {Policy Research Using Agent-Based Modeling to Assess Future Impacts of
   Urban Expansion into Farmlands and Forests},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The expansion of urban land uses into farmlands and forests requires an
   assessment of future ecological impacts. Spatially explicit agent-based
   models can represent the changes in resilience and ecological services
   that result from different land-use policies. When modeling complex
   adaptive systems, both the methods used to interpret results and the
   standards of rigor used to judge adequacy are complicated and require
   additional research. Recent studies suggest that it would be appropriate
   to use these models as an extension of exploratory analysis. This type
   of analysis generates ensembles of alternate plausible representations
   of future system conditions. User expertise steers interactive, stepwise
   system exploration toward inductive reasoning about potential changes to
   the system. In this study, we develop understanding of the potential
   alternative futures for a social-ecological system by way of successive
   simulations that test variations in the types and numbers of policies.
   The model addresses the agricultural-urban interface and the
   preservation of ecosystem services. The landscape analyzed is at the
   junction of the McKenzie and Willamette Rivers adjacent to the cities of
   Eugene and Springfield in Lane County, Oregon. Our exploration of
   alternative future scenarios suggests that policies that constrain urban
   growth and create incentives for farming and forest enterprises to
   preserve and enhance habitat can protect ecosystem resilience and
   services.},

Title = {Emergence unites ecology and society},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The effort to combine analysis of ecosystems and social systems requires
   a firm theoretical basis. When humans are present in an ecosystem, their
   actions affect emergent structures; this paper examines forms of
   emergence that account for the presence of humans. Humans monitor and
   regulate ecosystems based on their cultural systems. Cultural systems
   consist of concepts linked in complicated ways that can form consistent
   world views, can contain inconsistencies, and may or may not accurately
   model the properties of a social-ecological system. Consequently, human
   monitoring and regulating processes will differ, depending on cultural
   systems. Humans, as agents, change or maintain pre-existing material and
   cultural emergent structures. The presentation is illustrated with a
   case study of fire-prone forests. The paper shows that explicit
   attention to emergence serves very well in unifying the following
   requirements for social-ecological analysis: coherent and observable
   definitions of sustainability; ways to link ecological and social
   phenomena; ways to understand cultural reasons for stability and
   instability in dynamic social-ecological systems; and ways to include
   human self-evaluation and culture within dynamic models of
   social-ecological systems. Analysis of cultural emergent structures
   clarifies many differences in assumptions among the fields of economics,
   sociology, political science, ecology, and ecological economics. Because
   it can be readily applied to empirical questions, the framework provides
   a good way to organize policy analysis that is not dominated by one or
   another discipline.},

Abstract = {Streamside forests of urbanizing coastal regions lie at the nexus of
   global changes: rising sea levels, increasing storm surge, expanding
   urban development, and invasive species. To understand how these
   combined stressors affect forest conditions, we identified forest
   patches adjacent to urban land, analyzed adjacent land cover, modeled
   forest inundation, and sampled 100 sites across the Chesapeake Bay and
   Delaware Bay watersheds. We found that the majority of forest patches
   are adjacent to urban land and projected flooding will affect 8-19\% of
   regional forested land. We observed non-native invasive plants in 94\%
   of forest plots. Trees were predominantly native, but over half of shrub
   stems were invasive species and more than 80\% of plots contained
   invasive woody vines. Disturbance of human origin was correlated with
   abundance of invasive trees. Signs of deer activity were common.
   Richness and number of growth forms of invasive plants were related to
   adjacent agricultural land cover. These data reveal that streamside
   forests are impacted by the interacting stressors of urbanization,
   climate change, and invasive species spread. Our results emphasize the
   importance of protection and restoration of forests in urban regions and
   point to the need for a social-ecological systems approach to improve
   their condition.},

Title = {Multiple method modelling reveals lack of robustness in natural resource
   management research},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {281},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Research on natural resource management like fisheries, irrigation
   systems or forestry traditionally uses case studies providing us with a
   rich, in-depth perspective on many single systems. This comes with a
   disadvantage - lacking comparability as differences between studies
   exist in variables examined, their operationalization or methods used.
   Thus, studies often disagree on important drivers for ecological
   success. However, due to design differences the reasons behind different
   results often remain unknown. One reason might be the impact of method
   choice. Hence, this article tests the influence of methods on model
   results. We use a high-quality data set, the Nepal Irrigation
   Institutions and Systems database (NIIS), developed at the Ostrom
   Workshop. It contains 263 cases, each record having information on
   around 600 variables. Multiple machine learning methods - random forests
   (RF), gradient boosting (GBM), shallow neural networks (SNN) and deep
   neural networks (DNN) - are compared with a standard statistical
   approach (multivariate linear regressions (MLR)). We try to answer the
   question whether these methods differ in estimating the relevance for
   success of such well-known concepts like participation of users,
   resource size, relations with other groups, and social capital among
   others. The results indicate that both agreements and substantial
   differences exist across methods which casts doubt on the robustness of
   previous results. Hence, we advise more caution in interpreting existing
   results. We see this research as a step towards increasing the
   robustness of results and improving both generalisability and
   reproducibility of natural resource management research.},

Title = {Biocultural restoration in Hawai'i also achieves core conservation goals},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Biocultural approaches to restoration have demonstrated multiple
   benefits for human communities, but the ecological benefits and
   trade-offs involved have received little attention. Using a case study
   from Hawai'i, we examined if forest restoration aimed at reviving and
   maintaining cultural interactions with the forest is compatible with
   other priority conservation metrics. We identified species of high
   biocultural value for an Indigenous (Native Hawaiian) community, and
   then tested if these species also have high conservation value in terms
   of their biogeographic origin, ability to support native wildlife, and
   ability to persist independently within the restored context.
   Additionally, we tested if an assemblage of species with high
   biocultural value can also support high functional trait diversity. We
   found bioculturally important species to have high conservation values
   for all metrics tested, except for the ability to conserve rare or
   endangered endemic species. However, a broader application of
   biocultural conservation, such as the revival of the ``sacred forest{''}
   concept, can address this priority as part of a mosaic of different
   species assemblages and levels of access. We also found that biocultural
   value may, at least in part, be a function of coevolutionary time: the
   length of time over which a community has interacted with a given
   species. Given that forests are invaluable to many Indigenous
   communities and, given the existential threats many of these communities
   currently face, we suggest that forests containing species assemblages
   of high biocultural value, such as those in Hawai?i, be considered as
   critical cultural habitat.},

Title = {Assessment of green infrastructure performance through an urban
   resilience lens},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {289},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Green infrastructure (GI) is widely recognized for reducing risk of
   flooding, improving water quality, and harvesting stormwater for
   potential future use. GI can be an important part of a strategy used in
   urban planning to enhance sustainable development and urban resilience.
   However, existing literature lacks a comprehensive assessment framework
   to evaluate GI performance in terms of promoting ecosystem functions and
   services for social-ecological system resilience. We propose a robust
   indicator set consisting of quantitative and qualitative measurements
   for a scenario-based planning support system to assess the capacity of
   urban resilience. Green Infrastructure in Urban Resilience Planning
   Support System (GIUR-PSS) supports decision-making for GI planning
   through scenario comparisons with the urban resilience capacity index.
   To demonstrate GIUR-PSS, we developed five scenarios for the Congress
   Run sub-watershed (Mill Creek watershed, Ohio, USA) to test common types
   of GI (rain barrels, rain gardens, detention basins, porous pavement,
   and open space). Results show the open space scenario achieves the
   overall highest performance (GI Urban Resilience Index = 4.27/5). To
   implement the open space scenario in our urban demonstration site,
   suitable vacant lots could be converted to greenspace (e.g., forest,
   detention basins, and low-impact recreation areas). GIUR-PSS is easy to
   replicate, customize, and apply to cities of different sizes to assess
   environmental, economic, and social benefits provided by different types
   of GI installations. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Understanding Human-Fire Interactions in Tropical Forest Regions: a Case
   for Interdisciplinary Research across the Natural and Social Sciences.},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Fire in the forested tropics has profound environmental, economic, and
   social impacts at multiple geographical scales. Causes of tropical fires
   are widely documented, although research contributions are from many
   disciplines, and each tends to focus on specific facets of a research
   problem, which might limit understanding of fire as a complex
   social-ecological system. We conducted a systematic review to (1)
   examine geographic and methodological focus in tropical fire research;
   (2) identify which types of landholders are the focus of the research
   effort; (3) test for a research method effect on the variables, e. g.,
   socio-political, economic, and climatic, identified as causes of and
   proposed management solutions to tropical fire; and (4) examine
   relationships between causal factors and proposed solutions. Results
   from 51 studies show distinct geographic and methodological tendencies
   in the literature. Few studies explicitly identify landholder types, and
   no social studies focused on large-landholders. Multiple drivers and
   potential solutions to preventing fire are identified and the research
   approach adopted had the strongest influence on the socioeconomic,
   direct fire management and landscape characteristics variables. There
   was an overall mismatch between identified cause and proposed management
   solution. These findings indicate that mixed method approaches are
   imperative to understanding the coupled human-nature system of fire and
   to improve rural development and management strategies to curtail
   tropical fire spread.},

Title = {People-Centric Nature-Based Land Restoration Through Agroforestry: A
   Typology},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Restoration depends on purpose and context. At the core it entails
   innovation to halt ongoing and reverse past degradation. It aims for
   increased functionality, not necessarily recovering past system states.
   Location-specific interventions in social-ecological systems reducing
   proximate pressures, need to synergize with transforming generic drivers
   of unsustainable land use. After reviewing pantropical international
   research on forests, trees, and agroforestry, we developed an
   options-by-context typology. Four intensities of land restoration
   interact: R.I. Ecological intensification within a land use system,
   R.II. Recovery/regeneration, within a local social-ecological system,
   R.III. Reparation/recuperation, requiring a national policy context,
   R.IV. Remediation, requiring international support and investment.
   Relevant interventions start from core values of human identity while
   addressing five potential bottlenecks: Rights, Know-how, Markets
   (inputs, outputs, credit), Local Ecosystem Services (including water,
   agrobiodiversity, micro/mesoclimate) and Teleconnections (global climate
   change, biodiversity). Six stages of forest transition (from closed
   old-growth forest to open-field agriculture and re-treed (peri)urban
   landscapes) can contextualize interventions, with six special places:
   water towers, riparian zone and wetlands, peat landscapes, small islands
   and mangroves, transport infrastructure, and mining scars. The typology
   can help to link knowledge with action in people-centric restoration in
   which external stakeholders coinvest, reflecting shared responsibility
   for historical degradation and benefits from environmental stewardship.},

Title = {Effects of livelihood strategies on mangrove-forest resource Do the
   consumption behaviour of households jeopardise the forest resource base?},
Journal = {MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {25},
Number = {6},
Pages = {696-711},
Abstract = {Purpose-The cumulative effects of climate change exacerbate interruption
   of social-ecological system. The purpose of this paper is to investigate
   whether the consumption smoothing along with other socioeconomic
   parameters of households affects the common pool resource base of a
   forest in an economic depression resulted from climate change triggered
   disasters.
   Design/methodology/approach-This paper is a field level study of Koyra
   sub-district in the Southwestern coastal region of Bangladesh. Several
   parameters namely climatic trends and events, damage pattern suffered by
   households, change in land ownership and occupation pattern and
   consumption dependency pattern were considered. Methods used for data
   collection were household questionnaire survey and focus group
   discussions in the study area.
   Findings-Both the intensity and frequency of climate change led
   catastrophes are found higher in the study area resulting damage of
   assets and capital goods of households. The average annual disaster
   damage borne by per household is found US\$177. Over the last two
   decades 8.21 per cent households become landless. During same time span
   more than 25 per cent households switched from cropping to other
   non-agricultural occupations and more than 26 per cent households depend
   on forest resource for their consumption smoothing.
   Originality/value-The paper provides insights how climate change led
   disasters induce the households to depend on the resource from the
   mangrove forest Sundarbans for their livelihood earning as well as
   consumption smoothing.},

Abstract = {The responses of urban park woodlands to large disturbances provide the
   opportunity to identify and examine linkages in social-ecological
   systems in urban landscapes. We propose that the Panarchy model
   consisting of hierarchically nested adaptive cycles provides a useful
   framework to evaluate those linkages. We use two case studies as
   examples Cherokee Park in Louisville, Kentucky, USA and Tijuca Forest in
   Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In the Cherokee Park case study, the
   disturbance, a destructive tornado, triggered bottom-up societal
   responses that created new institutions that influenced park management
   and shifted the woodland community from a successional pathway dominated
   by invasive exotic plants to one where native plant species are
   regaining importance. In the Tijuca Forest example, the disturbance,
   large scale land-use changes during the 18th century, triggered
   primarily top-down societal responses to create the world's largest
   urban forest through a transformative programme of intensive
   multispecies forest replanting and management. Currently, fine scale
   disturbances primarily anthropogenically caused fire threaten portions
   of Tijuca Forest through loss of forest structure and establishment of
   flammable invasive plants, and again elicited top-down societal
   responses to stop further destruction and promote greater native plant
   regeneration. These case studies illustrate that either natural or
   anthropogenic disturbances to natural systems can alter the direction
   and magnitude of interactions between social and natural domains in
   urban landscapes in a co-adaptive manner that alters structures and
   processes in both system components.},

Abstract = {Sustainable management of complex social-ecological systems depends on
   understanding the effects of different drivers of change, but
   disentangling these effects poses a challenge. We provide a framework
   for quantifying the relative contributions of different components of a
   social-ecological system to the system's outcomes, using forest fires in
   the western United States as a model. Specifically, we examine the
   difference in wildfire probability in similar forests under different
   management regimes (federally managed vs. privately owned) in eleven
   western states from 1989-2016 and compare the magnitude of the
   management effect to the effect of climate variables. We find a greater
   probability of wildfires in federally managed forests than in privately
   owned forests, with a 127\% increase in the absolute difference between
   the two management regimes over the 28 year time period. However, in
   1989, federally managed forests were 2.67 times more likely to burn than
   privately owned forests, but in 2016, they were only 1.52 times more
   likely to burn. Finally, we find that the effect of the different
   management regimes is greater than the marginal (one-unit change) effect
   of most climate variables. Our results indicate that projections of
   future fire probability must account for both climate and management
   variables, while our methodology provides a framework for quantitatively
   comparing different drivers of change in complex social-ecological
   systems.},

   Variability and Extremes: Emerging Insights on the Contribution of REDD},

Abstract = {Climate change spurs havoc on social-ecological system. People and
   places vulnerable to climate change have been the focus of many
   discussions. However, in the forestry sector, limited studies have been
   conducted that link human vulnerability to recent initiatives, such as
   reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation or REDD+,
   especially in highly vulnerable countries. Using case studies from the
   Philippines, this paper focuses on the vulnerability of two
   community-based forest management (CBFM) organizations, with and without
   REDD+ readiness intervention, to show the impacts of climate variability
   and extremes. Two balance-weighted approaches, the livelihood
   vulnerability index and the IPCC-framework, were used in the
   vulnerability assessments. Results revealed high vulnerability of both
   CBFM organizations, although Malitbog Upland Developers for Sustainable
   Association (MUDSA) livelihood vulnerability is largely aggravated by
   its exposure to disaster, climate variability and extremes,
   accessibility to health facilities and water supply. The long history of
   CBFM implementation in both organizations have minimal contribution in
   enhancing the adaptive capacity of members to cope with and adapt to
   climate change impacts. REDD+ (readiness), does not insure reduced
   vulnerability to climate change, unless sustainable livelihood is
   achieved. As the State controls forest resources, the rights of
   CBFM-organizations to commercially benefit from these resources are
   limited, a disincentive to the development of new and viable development
   programs in CBFM areas, such as REDD+. This also constrains the
   achievement of climate resiliency.},

Abstract = {Mitigating climate change, preventing mass species extinctions,
   improving rural livelihoods, and disaster risk reduction are among
   today's most urgent challenges. To meet these challenges, a large number
   of social actors need to agree to engage and act collectively on Forest
   and Landscape Restoration (FLR), ensuring its dual goal of restoring
   ecological functionality and improving people's wellbeing. Although FLR
   has gained momentum globally, the experiences so far continue to face
   socio-economic and governance challenges associated with the design and
   realization of effective efforts. Social Innovation (SI) can be seen
   contemporarily as the process and the result of interaction between
   stakeholders in the construction of solutions to social needs and
   problems, including those tackled by FLR. Here, using a content analysis
   approach applied to existing literature, we propose five possible
   conceptual bridges between FLR and SI. The Social Innovative - Forest
   and Landscape Restoration (SI-FLR) process advocates that sustainable
   livelihood needs should be attended first to ensure the
   Social-Ecological Systems' resilience. These bridges are: (1)
   ``Landscape as the main context{''}; (2) ``Nature as social need{''};
   (3) ``Landscape stewardship groups{''}; (4) ``Governance
   capabilities{''}; (5) ``Adapting and transforming to enhance
   resilience.{''} Identifying these bridges, will help decision-makers and
   project managers to improve the FLR initiatives by supporting the
   potential of SI and sparking the interest of other researchers to
   explore the many possibilities of SI-FLR.},

Abstract = {Climate change and ecological transformation are causing natural
   resource management to be applied to nonstationary systems. Managers can
   respond to dynamic ecosystems by resisting, accepting, or directing
   ecological change. Management response is constrained by a decision
   context, defined as an interconnected social system of values, rules,
   and knowledge that affects how problems can be addressed. We provide a
   multi-scale blueprint for creating a decision context that increases
   capacity for implementing climate adaptation, including novel approaches
   in the National Wildlife Refuge System, a continental conservation
   network administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. We use the
   Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska as case study to illustrate
   blueprint concepts and to provide ``proof-of-concept{''} for
   application. The blueprint builds on ideas and practices from scenario
   planning, adaptive management, and adaptive pathway planning, which are
   approaches that promote action in the face of uncertainty. Management
   considerations focus on stewarding biodiversity in a changing climate by
   addressing what futures are possible, what interventions can be used to
   shape future conditions, and how to coordinate a regional conservation
   strategy. The blueprint focus on decision context promotes a longer-term
   social process of engagement that is complementary to, but larger than,
   any one decision process.},

Abstract = {The ability of natural resource agencies to act before, during, and
   after outbreaks of conifer bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is
   important to ensure the continued provision of ecosystem services.
   Adaptive capacity refers to the capability of an agent or system to
   adapt to change, regardless of whether it is examined as an independent
   social or ecological entity, or as a coupled social-ecological system.
   Understanding the components of a disturbance and the associated effects
   to ecosystem services, social systems, and natural resource management
   increases the ability to adapt to change and ensure continued
   resilience. This paper presents a definition and conceptual framework of
   adaptive capacity relevant to bark beetle disturbances that was
   developed through an interdisciplinary workshop held in 2016. The intent
   is to assist natural resource managers and policy-makers in identifying
   important adaptation characteristics to effectively address bark beetle
   disturbances. The current state of knowledge regarding institutional,
   social, and environmental factors that influence adaptive capacity are
   identified. The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) in the
   western USA is used as a specific example to discuss several factors
   that influence adaptive capacity for increasing resilience. We hope that
   that our proposed framework serves as a model for future collaborations
   among both social and physical scientists and land managers to better
   address landscape-level disturbances that are being exacerbated by
   climate change.},

Abstract = {This paper explores whether fundamental differences exist between urban
   and rural vulnerability to climate-induced changes in the fire regime of
   interior Alaska. We further examine how communities and fire managers
   have responded to these changes and what additional adaptations could be
   put in place. We engage a variety of social science methods, including
   demographic analysis, semi-structured interviews, surveys, workshops and
   observations of public meetings. This work is part of an
   interdisciplinary study of feedback and interactions between climate,
   vegetation, fire and human components of the Boreal forest
   social-ecological system of interior Alaska. We have learned that
   although urban and rural communities in interior Alaska face similar
   increased exposure to wildfire as a result of climate change, important
   differences exist in their sensitivity to these biophysical,
   climate-induced changes. In particular, reliance on wild foods, delayed
   suppression response, financial resources and institutional connections
   vary between urban and rural communities. These differences depend
   largely on social, economic and institutional factors, and are not
   necessarily related to biophysical climate impacts per se. Fire
   management and suppression action motivated by political, economic or
   other pressures can serve as unintentional or indirect adaptation to
   climate change. However, this indirect response alone may not
   sufficiently reduce vulnerability to a changing fire regime. More
   deliberate and strategic responses may be required, given the magnitude
   of the expected climate change and the likelihood of an intensification
   of the fire regime in interior Alaska.},

Abstract = {Rattan is the most important non-forest timber product utilized by
   communities adjacent Lore Lindu National Park (LLNP). The establishment
   community conservation agreement (CCA) in 2001 was unable to prevent
   rattan depletion. Then, a local institution called community
   conservation partnership (CCP) has been recently proposed Therefore, the
   objective of this study is to explore how to craft a local institution
   of CCP for sustainable rattan governance in LLNP using Social-Ecological
   Systems (SES) Framework. The study was conducted in LLNP area and Ngata
   Toro, a buffer zone village of LLNP. We conducted rattan inventory and
   collected social data by interview for analyzing CCP development using
   SES framework. The results showed that CCP is most likely to be
   successful in implementing due to several reasons. Firstly, the
   establishment of constitutional-choice rules made clear the nested
   enterprise. Secondly, the reallocation of CCP location to the
   traditional zone increase the boundary clarity. Thirdly, transferring
   rights to the Ngata Toro community will make effective co-management,
   increase the legitimacy of rattan utilization, decrease potential
   conflicts among resource unit users and reducing monitoring cost.
   Finally, deciding the rattan harvesting quota will ensure the rattan
   ecological and livelihood sustainability. With the clarity of system
   boundaries and property rights, we argue that CCP institutions will
   bring many benefits in many ways. Overall, most variables of SES
   framework can be used to analyses the readiness of CCP institutional
   arrangement for sustainable rattan management in LLNP.},

Title = {Exploring sustainable land use in forested tropical social-ecological
   systems: A case-study in the Wet Tropics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {231},
Pages = {940-952},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Tropical countries lie at the nexus of three pressing issues for global
   sustainability: agricultural production, climate change mitigation and
   biodiversity conservation. The forces that drive forest protection do
   not necessarily oppose those that drive forest clearance for
   development. This decoupling, enhanced by the stronger economic forces
   compared to conservation, is detrimental for the social-ecological
   sustainability of forested tropical landscapes. This paper presents an
   integrated, and spatially-explicit, Agent-Based Model that examines the
   future impacts of land-use change scenarios on the sustainability of the
   Wet Tropics region of tropical Queensland, Australia. In particular, the
   model integrates Bayesian Belief Networks, Geographical Information
   Systems, empirical data and expert knowledge, under a
   land-sharing/land-sparing analysis, to study the impact of different
   landscape configurations on trade-offs and synergies among biodiversity
   and two ecosystem services (sugarcane production and carbon
   sequestration). Contrary to most tropical regions, model simulations
   show that Business As Usual is helping to reconcile these contrasting
   goals in the forested landscape of the Wet Tropics. The paper analyses
   which combination of governance and socio-economic factors is causing
   these positive results. This is an outstanding achievement for a
   tropical region, considering that most tropical areas are characterized
   for having stronger economic-land clearing forces compared to
   conservation forces, which reduce important ecosystem services for human
   wellbeing and the health of ecosystems.},

Title = {Economics of Yak herding in the Kanchenjunga landscape of the Eastern
   Himalayas},

Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Yak herding is one of the oldest market-based traditions, which is part
   of an integrated social-ecological system. But, it is at risk of
   extinction as yak herders are gradually shifting towards alternative
   occupations. The discontinuation of herding may have several
   implications such as loss of culture and degradation of the rangeland
   ecosystem. Though yak herding is not limited to the financial aspect of
   herding, this is considered a main cause of the discontinuation.
   Therefore, it is important to understand the economics of yak herding. A
   benefit-cost analysis of yak herding was carried out based on the
   interviews with 60 yak herders in the Kanchenjunga landscape, Nepal. The
   results indicate that yak herding is not financially attractive. High
   mortality of calves and adults is threatening this occupation, and
   degrading rangelands are increasing the costs. Yak herding generates
   substantial amount of social and ecological benefits in terms of
   preserving culture, maintaining rangeland ecosystems and curbing illegal
   activities. If these benefits are included, then the benefit-cost ratio
   and internal rate of return would be 1.32 and 10.44 respectively. Since
   yak herding generates low direct profits and requires herders to stay in
   remote areas, there is a high risk of discontinuation of this profession
   by successive generations of youth. This study suggests to improve
   rangeland management through prescribed burning and provisioning of
   health services, particularly in summer pastures and incentivize yak
   herders for generating positive externalities.},

Volume = {60},
Pages = {197-205},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The question of under what settings locally managed forests will lead to
   successful conservation without frustrating the local people's
   subsistence outcomes remains contested. This research investigates the
   relationship between attributes of locally managed forest SES and its
   forest and livelihood outcomes using data from 83 forest SESs across
   seven countries. The data were obtained from the International Forestry
   Resources and Institutions (IFRI) database. Thirteen predicators that
   were selected from the attributes of forest, user group and governance
   of the local forest SES were used to evaluate their influence on SES
   sustainability. Our results showed that sustainable forest SES was
   significantly associated with forest size, diversity of the NTFP that is
   extracted from the forest, networks among the forest users, rule making
   by external non-forest harvest organizations in dispute resolution, and
   benefits sharing. On the other hand, the distance of forest users'
   settlements in the forest, rule making for forest protection and harvest
   quantity as well as sanctions by external non-forest harvest
   organizations were found to be significantly associated with
   unsustainable forest SESs. Our findings have important implications for
   the ongoing discourse on how to promote sustainable forest management at
   local level. The results on the success factors can assist decision
   makers to improve the chances for the success of forest governance that
   rely on local people who depend upon forests. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Protected areas (PA) are effective means for protecting biodiversity,
   but less is known about their effect on the social-ecological system
   (SES). Using a semi-experimental approach and a descriptive case study
   based evaluation, we analyzed the effect of a PA in the Yucatan
   Peninsula on land-cover and household resource management strategies in
   time and space (before and after the PA establishment; inside and
   outside its limits). To assess the changes of land-use practices in the
   areas surrounding the communities inside and outside the PA, and their
   change over time (from 2003 to 2015), we used remote sensing analysis
   and semi-structured interviews. Our results show that after the PA was
   established, the forest increased and agricultural plots decreased
   inside and to a lesser extent outside the PA. However, fires reduced the
   area of old-growth forest and increased young secondary forest,
   highlighting the system's vulnerability to uncommon events. Resource
   management strategies were also affected: while inside the PA households
   tended toward specializing on tourism, outside the PA household
   strategies implied a diversification of productive activities. Overall,
   the establishment of the PA proved to be an effective tool to promote
   forest recovery and prevent deforestation in the regions surrounding the
   communities both inside and outside the PA.},

Title = {Comparing social representations of the landscape: a methodology},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Social representations (SRs) are systems of values, ideas, and practices
   that characterize individuals' and social groups' relationships to both
   their social and natural environment. Comparing SRs between places,
   social groups, and through time is critical to understanding how
   social-ecological systems (SESs) and their diverse uses are perceived,
   interpreted, and understood. This knowledge needs to be taken into
   account to achieve efficient land use management of SESs such as
   agricultural landscapes. People's perceptions of the landscape are
   increasingly studied in sustainability sciences and a growing number of
   studies use the SR framework for analyzing differences in SRs between
   stakeholders and localities or for detecting changes over time. Robust
   methodologies able to compare SRs are required for this purpose. In this
   paper, we propose a modular approach to studying SRs from words
   collected from free listing tasks. This approach relies on standardizing
   definitions of frequency thresholds commonly used to assess SR content,
   consensus level, and structure. We then illustrate the value of this
   methodological approach through a comparative study of farmers' social
   representations of the agricultural landscape among four contrasted
   social-ecological contexts in France. We show how our comparative method
   allows for characterizing spatial variations in SRs and identifying
   social-ecological factors that influence the structuration and content
   of SRs. Finally, we discuss our methodological progress and the
   implications of our results for public policies aimed at managing SESs
   and in particular agricultural landscapes for conservation.},

Title = {Dynamics in the landscape ecology of institutions: lags, legacies, and

   Columbia, Canada 1858-2020},

Abstract = {ContextMany landscapes are constrained into pathways featuring
   deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and rising mega-disturbances due to
   legacies and feedbacks preserved in ecosystems and institutions.
   Institutions are the norms and rules that emerge locally or are set by
   prevailing powers, and that mediate coupled social-ecological
   dynamics.ObjectivesWe analyzed coupled landscape-institutional dynamics
   contributing to path-dependent mega-disturbances and the depletion of
   old-growth forests in temperate forests of British Columbia, Canada
   (1858-2020).MethodsWe used qualitative historical review to
   contextualize dynamics in a hierarchy of institutional structures (i.e.,
   power dynamics), functions (i.e., policy interventions), and processes
   (i.e., land management activities) and quantitative data to reconstruct
   their landscape outcomes. We examined connections between institutions
   and landscapes with a focus on temporal lags, legacies, and
   feedbacks.ResultsInstitutional structure persisted as an overarching
   colonial legacy (since 1858) whereas institutional functions (e.g.,
   policy interventions) were added more frequently (every 10-30 years) but
   tended to layer onto existing functions rather than replace them.
   Institutional processes dynamically reshaped forests through regimes of
   harvesting, tree planting, and fire suppression, while a fourth process
   of landscape monitoring acted as a feedback to enable institutional
   adaptation depending on what was monitored and by who.ConclusionsWe
   describe lags, legacies, and feedbacks as causal forces of change in
   landscape-institutional co-evolution, and contribute to emerging theory
   on the landscape ecology of institutions. To foster social-ecological
   resilience we recommend to (1) manage forests more locally; (2) restore
   complex landscapes; and (3) use reflective processes to help transform
   institutions to meet emerging landscape challenges.},

Title = {Maintaining or building roads? An adaptive management approach for
   preserving forest multifunctionality},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {537},
Pages = {1-9},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {The sustainable management of forests is a critical global challenge
   that requires meeting human needs while also preserving forest
   ecosystems and the livelihoods they provide. To achieve this goal,
   forest management must encompass all goods and services provided by the
   forest, and increasingly, forests are being viewed as complex
   social-ecological systems that require adaptive and multifunctional
   management. One key aspect of sustainable and multifunctional forest
   management is the use of shared infrastructures, such as roads, to
   connect the capacity for production and multifunctional use. However,
   the provision of roads raises issues and dilemmas, particularly in
   contexts where different forest functions have conflicting objectives.
   Effective governance is essential to address these challenges. In this
   article, we propose a control problem framework with infinite horizon
   that integrates the role of roads and their governance into adaptive
   management. Our approach involves using a dynamical forest model that
   considers the roads related to forest functions as part of the
   mathematical viability theory problem. We distinguish between different
   scenarios of mono-functional and multifunctional forest management and
   examine the safe operating space of the exploited ecosystems for each
   scenario. Our results demonstrate the formalization of complex
   interactions within a multifunctional forest system and highlight how
   even small changes in infrastructure provision strategies can
   dramatically impact the safe operating space of the forest ecosystem. By
   incorporating shared infrastructures into adaptive forest management, we
   can ensure the sustainability of both the forest ecosystem and the human
   communities that depend on it.},

Abstract = {Grazing-based livestock production, named pastoralism, is classified
   into nomadism, transhumance and agro-pastoralism. Transhumance is
   characterised by the seasonal and recurring movement of livestock
   whereby seasonal grazing areas and routes for livestock movement are
   fixed. All grazing based livestock production systems including
   transhumance are constrained globally for a variety of reasons. The
   major threats to the system are globalisation, nationalisation or
   privatisation of rangelands, national parks and community forestry
   policies restricting free grazing and shortage of labour. The collapse
   or decline of such social-ecological systems (SESs), which have existed
   for over 1000s years, often induces adverse impacts on societies and
   ecosystems. Here we review the literature on transhumance, and discuss
   reasons for transhumance, and the associated advantages and
   disadvantages of livestock movement in transhumance. Our review also
   focuses on how the integration of crop and livestock production in
   transhumance derives mutual benefits. The review indicates that the
   seasonal movement of livestock is an ecological necessity in areas with
   harsh climates and low pasture production. Transhumance is also a
   herders' adaptive management to adjust to variable grazing resources and
   environmental conditions. The disadvantages of seasonal movement of
   livestock such as greater herding labour required and expenditure of
   more energy for livestock, are far outweighed by the ecological
   advantages. Some of these are: to minimise grazing competition and to
   protect rangeland pastures from being over-grazed. Our review also
   indicates that the integration of crop and livestock production derives
   mutual benefits and contributes for their enhanced sustainability.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {This study intends to give recommendations to the management of Paraty
   fishery in Brazil through an interplay of local and scientific
   knowledge. In particular, the objectives are the following: 1) to
   describe the Paraty fishery; 2) to compare the fishermen's local
   ecological knowledge with recorded fish landings and previous studies in
   Paraty; 3) to combine the data on local fishing and on local/Caicara
   livelihoods with the SES (social-ecological systems) Model. The methods
   include a systematic survey of fishing in Tarituba and Praia Grande,
   which are located in the northern end and the central part of the Paraty
   municipality, respectively. For four days each month, systematic data on
   catches at landing points were collected, as well as macroscopic gonad
   analysis data for the fishes Centropomus parallelus and C. undecimalis
   (snook, robalo), Epinephelus marginatus (grouper, garoupa),
   Scomberomorus cavalla (King mackerel, cavala), and Lutjanus synagris
   (Lane snapper, vermelho). Spring and summer are important seasons during
   which some species reproduce, and the integration of fishing periods for
   some target species could assist in fishing management through the use
   of closed seasons. Fishermen could obtain complementary earnings from
   tourism and from the ``defeso system{''} (closed season including a
   salary payment) to conserve fishing stocks. The SES model facilitates an
   understanding of the historical context of fishing, its economic
   importance for local livelihoods, the constraints from conservation
   measures that affect fishermen, and the management processes that
   already exist, such as the defeso. If used to integrate fishing with
   complementary activities (tourism), such a system could improve the
   responsibility of fishermen regarding the conservation of fish stocks.},

Title = {Spatial Modeling of Social-Ecological Management Zones of the Ali'i Era
   on the Island of Kaua'i with Implications for Large-Scale Biocultural
   Conservation and Forest Restoration Efforts in Hawai'i},
Journal = {PACIFIC SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {71},

Abstract = {Policy makers and resource managers in Hawai'i often look to the ancient
   Hawaiian system of resource management, known as the ahupua'a -system,
   as a holistic and sustainable mountains-to-sea model for restoration of
   social-ecological system health and function. Many components of this
   ancient system, such as agriculture, aquaculture, and nearshore fishery
   management, have been documented, studied, and revived in the name of
   both sustainability and perpetuation of Hawai'i's indigenous culture.
   One relatively glaring hole in the context of our understanding of this
   ancient system is management of forest resources on a system (i.e.,
   large-scale plant community) level. Five terms for identified and
   managed social-ecological zones, wao kanaka, wao la'au, wao nahele, wao
   kele, and wao akua, were used to delineate GIS layers in the model
   ahupua'a of Ha'ena. These were then extrapolated across the entire
   island of Kaua'i. The resulting map indicates that not all ahupua'a on
   Kaua'i had all five social-ecological zones, which gives valuable
   insight into how upland regions of the various ahupua'a may have been
   managed in the ali'i era. This research has implications for
   contemporary approaches to large-scale biocultural conservation
   initiatives and other resource management plans that aim toward having
   broader community support for such efforts. Analysis shows that broad
   overlap between the ancient system and contemporary management zones
   exists, which implies that it may be feasible to adapt this ancient
   approach in the bureaucratic system of the contemporary era.},

Title = {Firewood Collection in South Africa: Adaptive Behavior in
   Social-Ecological Models},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Due to the fact that the South Africa's savanna landscapes are under
   changing conditions, the previously sustainable firewood collection
   system in rural areas has become a social-ecological factor in questions
   about landscape management. While the resilience of savannas in national
   parks such as Kruger National Park (KNP) in South Africa has been widely
   acknowledged in ecosystem management, the resilience of woody vegetation
   outside protected areas has been underappreciated. Collecting wood is
   the dominant source of energy for rural households, and there is an
   urgent need for land management to find sustainable solutions for this
   complex social-ecological system. However, the firewood collection
   scenario is only one example, and stands for all human-ecosystem service
   interactions under the topic of over-utilization, e.g., fishery,
   grazing, harvesting. Agent-based modeling combined with goal-oriented
   action planning (GOAP) can provide fresh insights into the relationship
   between individual needs of humans and changes in land use. At the same
   time, this modeling approach includes adaptive behavior under changing
   conditions. A firewood collection scenario was selected for a
   proof-of-concept comprising households, collectors, ecosystem services
   and firewood sites. Our results have shown that, even when it is
   predictable what a single human agent will do, massive up-scaling is
   needed in order to understand the whole complexity of social-ecological
   systems. Under changing conditions, such as climate and an increasing
   population, fair distribution of natural goods become an important
   issue.},

Title = {Rapid ecosystem change challenges the adaptive capacity of Local
   Environmental Knowledge},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {31},
Pages = {272-284},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The use of Local Environmental Knowledge has been considered as an
   important strategy for adaptive management in the face of Global
   Environmental Change. However, the unprecedented rates at which global
   change occurs may pose a challenge to the adaptive capacity of local
   knowledge systems. In this paper, we use the concept of the shifting
   baseline syndrome to examine the limits in the adaptive capacity of the
   local knowledge of an indigenous society facing rapid ecosystem change.
   We conducted semi-structured interviews regarding perceptions of change
   in wildlife populations and in intergenerational transmission of
   knowledge amongst the Tsimane', a group of hunter-gatherers of Bolivian
   Amazonia (n = 300 adults in 13 villages). We found that the natural
   baseline against which the Tsimane' measure ecosystem changes might be
   shifting with every generation as a result of (a) age-related
   differences in the perception of change and (b) a decrease in the
   intergenerational sharing of environmental knowledge. Such findings
   suggest that local knowledge systems might not change at a rate quick
   enough to adapt to conditions of rapid ecosystem change, hence
   potentially compromising the adaptive success of the entire
   social-ecological system. With the current pace of Global Environmental
   Change, widening the gap between the temporal rates of on-going
   ecosystem change and the timescale needed for local knowledge systems to
   adjust to change, efforts to tackle the shifting baseline syndrome are
   urgent and critical for those who aim to use Local Environmental
   Knowledge as a tool for adaptive management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Participatory action research and environmental learning: implications
   for resilient forests and communities},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5-6},
Pages = {611-627},
Abstract = {How can a participatory approach to research promote environmental
   learning and enhance social-ecological systems resilience? Participatory
   action research (PAR) is an approach to research that its' supporters
   claim can foster new knowledge, learning, and action to support positive
   social and environmental change through reorienting the standard process
   of knowledge production. PAR is posited as being particularly suitable
   for use with historically disadvantaged groups. As such it may be a
   useful tool for environmental learning which would enable a
   social-ecological system to better respond to change as theorized by
   resilience thinkers. In this paper, we examine a PAR project to
   determine how PAR fostered environmental learning and, in turn, how the
   learning influenced resilience. The project partnered an ecologist,
   federal and state forest managers, and harvesters of salal (Gaultheria
   shallon), a non-timber forest product gathered and sold for use in the
   floral industry in the forests of the Olympic Peninsula, Washington,
   USA. Based on interviews with each group of partners during and after
   the PAR project, we found that the PAR approach did indeed generate
   environmental learning, defined here as ecological literacy, civic
   literacy, values awareness, and self-efficacy, and contributed to
   resiliency through promoting greater diversity, memory, redundancy, and
   adaptive capacity. However, the political vulnerability of the salal
   harvesters, who were largely undocumented Latino workers, inhibited the
   extent to which adaptive measures could be taken to revise permitting
   procedures and additional collaborative research. We conclude that the
   PAR approach is a valuable tool for environmental learning but the
   extent to which learning can actually promote system change and greater
   resilience must also be understood within the underlying context,
   especially political realities.},

Title = {Can Disparate Shared Social Values Benefit the Conservation of
   Biodiversity in Hong Kong's Sacred Groves?},
Journal = {HUMAN ECOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {51},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1021-1032},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {As socio-ecological systems of high conservation value, sacred groves
   are subject to intense competing interests worldwide. Hong Kong's fung
   shui woodlands (FSW) are an ancient form of sacred grove derived from
   old-growth forest fragments protected for geomantic beliefs relating to
   their proximity to traditional villages and subsequently modified
   through planting, exploitation, and natural succession. Today, they
   contain approximately 30\% of the territory's native flora and are the
   only remaining localities for many rare plants, but inconsistent
   government policy and declining community involvement have led to
   mismatched expectations whereby biodiversity suffers by default. To
   identify common ground for better management, we interviewed residents
   of nine villages to quantify self-stated degree of connectedness and the
   relative importance of five shared social values in relation to the FSW
   at each location. One-third of respondents claimed no knowledge of the
   FSW in their village and more than two-thirds had never even visited it,
   but most expressed positive attachment particularly with respect to
   perceived health/social and historical/cultural value. Connectedness was
   a strong predictor of importance attributed to all values and was
   correlated with gender, education level, and protected status: women
   were significantly less connected with FSW than men, more educated
   respondents exhibited greater FSW connectedness, and residents at
   protected sites expressed greater connectedness than those at
   unprotected ones. Importance varied significantly with indigeneity and
   age group, but not species richness or conservation value. We infer that
   biodiversity could benefit from nuanced policy that promotes
   connectedness through emphasis of wider societal values.},

Title = {What drives reindeer management in Finland towards social and ecological
   tipping points?},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Reindeer management (RM) in northern Fennoscandia is an example of
   social-ecological systems (SESs) providing social, cultural, ecological,
   and economic values. Changing climate and pasture conditions and
   societal changes continue to transform the operational environment of
   RM. These key drivers, and resulting transformations including
   alternative SES states, have not been studied in detail before. Our
   comprehensive literature review and interviews with herders reveal that
   land use, climate change, and governance drive the emergence of SES
   tipping points. The basis of successful RM depends on the quantity and
   quality of pastures to secure animal fitness. However, intensive
   forestry, extreme weather, and predators constrain the availability of
   forage and suitable calving grounds. Maintaining RM by means of
   predation compensation mechanisms and regular supplementary winter
   feeding to adapt to changes brought about by land use and warming
   climate comprises an alternative system state. However, if negative
   impacts increase remarkably or rapidly and compensatory mechanisms
   become insufficient, long-term impacts on system identity, and even
   local collapses, are expected. Although some environmental and societal
   changes are perceived as pressures by herders, they can be beneficial
   for other livelihoods in the region. Therefore, our study raises
   questions for future studies on social justice, such as who has the
   right to decide what constitutes a desirable system state, or what
   collaborative efforts to maintain RM in Fennoscandia would entail. Our
   work is applicable also in other Arctic/sub-Arctic regions where
   nature-based livelihoods, such as small-scale forestry and agriculture,
   hunting, traditional fishing, and gathering are practiced.},

Title = {Actor-based identification of deforestation drivers paves the road to
   effective REDD plus in DR Congo},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {123-132},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Conversion of tropical forests remains high on the international agenda,
   but the effectiveness of the proposed framework to reduce emissions from
   deforestation and degradation (REDD+) has been questioned. We
   hypothesized that an effective implementation of REDD+ would require
   understanding of the functioning of the local social-ecological system
   and modulation of actions to the actors' characteristics and motivations
   in the affected areas. But cross-scale studies of deforestation drivers
   are seldom performed, given the difficulties to obtain consistent
   datasets, particularly for the local scale. We addressed this issue for
   the agricultural expansion in the Central Basin of the Democratic
   Republic of Congo, a REDD+ priority country.
   We detected considerable variation in deforestation rate within scale
   levels, with highest variation at village and household level, which had
   gone unnoticed so far. Population density and market access are the main
   sources of inter- village variation, although cultural factors affect
   magnitude by an order of 2. Individual household contributions to
   deforestation are strongly unevenly distributed, with longer established
   households and better market integrated households deforesting more than
   others.
   Our results reveal that due to the current lack of cross-scale studies,
   policy makers are lacking context specific relevant information at local
   scale needed to design efficient, effective and equitable policies. They
   also challenge the dominant discourse that agricultural expansion in the
   Basin is driven by poor subsistence farmers, and make us add
   actor-oriented interventions and land use zoning as two crucial
   requirements for REDD+ intensification policies to become effective. (C)

Abstract = {We explored the social and ecological outcomes associated with emergence
   of a management panacea designed to govern a stochastic renewable
   natural resource. To that end, we constructed a model of a coupled
   social-ecological system of recreational fisheries in which a manager
   supports naturally fluctuating stocks by stocking fish in response to
   harvest-driven satisfaction of resource users. The realistic assumption
   of users remembering past harvest experiences when exploiting a
   stochastically fluctuating fish population facilitates the emergence of
   a stocking-based management panacea over time. The social benefits of
   panacea formation involve dampening natural population fluctuations and
   generating stability of user satisfaction. It also maintains the
   resource but promotes the eventual replacement of wild fish by
   hatchery-descended fish. Our analyses show this outcome is particularly
   likely when hatchery-descended fish are reasonably fit (e.g.,
   characterized by similar survival relative to wild fish) and/or when
   natural recruitment of the wild population is low(e.g., attributable to
   habitat deterioration), which leaves the wild population with little
   buffer against competition by stocked fish. The potential for
   release-based panacea formation is particularly likely under user-based
   management regimes and should be common in a range of social-ecological
   systems (e.g., fisheries, forestry), whenever user groups are entitled
   to engage in release or replanting strategies. The net result will be
   the preservation of a renewable resource through user-based incentives,
   but the once natural populations are likely to be altered and to host
   nonnative genotypes. This risks other ecosystem services and the future
   of wild populations.},

Title = {Coping with Dismantling Forces: Traditional Management and
   Transformations of Szekely-Hungarian Village Commons of Transylvania, in
   the 16-21th Centuries},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},

Pages = {278-294},
Abstract = {The Szekelyfold region of Transylvania, Romania is a unique
   social-ecological system and a traditional farming landscape with rich
   biological and cultural diversity. Commons institutions have ancient
   roots here, and are still prevalent today. In this paper, we attempt to
   give an overview of the traditional organisation, accelerating
   challenges, transformations and reorganisations of the Szekely commons
   over their history based on existing literature, covering the interval
   between the 16th and 21th centuries. Based on this overview, we also
   identify key drivers for resilience that counteracted dismantling
   forces, to account for the long persistence and transformability of
   these institutions. We found that between the end of the 16th and the
   mid-19th centuries, Szekely commons showed remarkable stability in their
   functioning based on village bylaws, and these documents also
   demonstrate that most communities could be characterised by Ostrom's
   design principles in this period. From the 19th century, the pressures
   of state centralisation, market integration, new technologies,
   population growth, polarisation and changing values intensified,
   creating significant dismantling forces. However. Szekely commons
   survived, and we argue that the harsh mountainous environment and
   isolation, coupled with locally rooted identity, worldview and a rich
   institutional memory, and also the traditional notions of equity and the
   widespread availability of common resources constituted elements of
   resilience, which helped to prevent dissolution. We conclude that as
   direct human-nature links lie at the heart of many of the identified
   drivers for resilience, nurturing these links seems essential for the
   survival of traditional local institutions and management practices that
   maintain biological and cultural diversity in a globalised world.},

Title = {Stewardship, learning, and memory in disaster resilience},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5-6},
Pages = {591-609},
Abstract = {In this contribution, we propose and explore the following hypothesis:
   civic ecology practices, including urban community forestry, community
   gardening, and other self-organized forms of stewardship of green spaces
   in cities, are manifestations of how memories of the role of greening in
   healing can be instrumentalized through social learning to foster
   social-ecological system (SES) resilience following crisis and disaster.
   Further, we propose that civic ecology communities of practice within
   and across cities help to leverage these memories into effective
   practices, and that these communities of practice serve as urban
   iterations of the collaborative and adaptive management practices that
   play a role in SES resilience in more rural settings. We present two
   urban examples to build support for this hypothesis: the Living
   Memorials Project in post-9/11 New York City, and community forestry in
   New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. These cases demonstrate what we
   refer to as a memorialization mechanism that leads to feedbacks critical
   to SES resilience. The process begins immediately after a crisis, when a
   spontaneous and collective memorialization of lost ones through
   gardening and tree planting ensues, following which a community of
   practice emerges to act upon and apply these memories to social learning
   about greening practices. This in turn may lead to new kinds of
   learning, including about collective efficacy and ecosystem services
   production, through a kind of feedback between remembering, learning,
   and enhancing individual, social, and environmental well-being. This
   process, in the case of greening in cities, may confer SES resilience,
   through contributing to both psychological-social resistance and
   resilience and ecosystem benefits.},

Title = {A conceptual framework of urban forest ecosystem vulnerability},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {115-126},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The urban environment is becoming the most common setting in which
   people worldwide will spend their lives. Urban forests, and the
   ecosystem services they provide, are becoming a priority for
   municipalities. Quantifying and communicating the vulnerability of this
   resource are essential for maintaining a consistent and equitable supply
   of these ecosystem services. We propose a theory-based conceptual
   framework for the assessment of urban forest vulnerability that
   integrates the biophysical, built, and human components of urban forest
   ecosystems. A review and description of potential vulnerability
   indicators are provided. Urban forest vulnerability can be defined as
   the likelihood of decline in ecosystem service supply and its associated
   benefits for human populations, urban infrastructure, and biodiversity.
   It is comprised of (i) exposure, which refers to the stressors and
   disturbances associated with the urban environment that negatively
   affect ecosystem function, (ii) sensitivity, which is determined by
   urban forest structure and dictates the system response to forcing from
   exposures and the magnitude of potential impacts, and (iii) adaptive
   capacity, which is the social and environmental capacity of a system to
   shift or alter its conditions to reduce its vulnerability or to improve
   its ability to function while stressed. Potential impacts, or losses in
   ecosystem service supply, are temporal in nature and require
   backward-looking monitoring and (or) forward-looking modelling to be
   measured and assessed. Vulnerability can be communicated through the use
   of indicators, aggregated indices, and mapping. A vulnerability approach
   can communicate complex issues to decision-makers and advance the
   theoretical understanding of urban forest ecosystems.},

Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A fundamental challenge is to understand and navigate trade-offs between
   ecosystem services (ES) in dynamic landscapes and to account for
   interactions between local people and broad-scale drivers, such as
   agricultural intensification. Many analyses of ES trade-offs rely on
   static mapping and biophysical indicators while disregarding the
   multiple uses, values, and desires for ES (UVD-ES) that local people
   associate with their changing landscapes. Here, a participatory UVD-ES
   framework was applied to assess differences in the use, values, and
   desire of ES between three zones with different land-use intensities
   (with pre-frontier, frontier, and post-frontier landscapes) in West
   Kalimantan (Indonesia). The analysis revealed that (1) almost the full
   suite of ES uses has become destabilized as a result of agricultural
   intensification; (2) ES more closely associated with agricultural
   intensification were largely desired by local people yet they still
   valued a diversity of traditional ES, such as those derived from the
   provision of non-timber forest products, fish, and other ES associated
   with non-material aspects including those tied to traditional culture;
   (3) the mismatch in used ES versus valued ES increased with agricultural
   intensification due to a decrease in the flow of non-timber forest
   products, aquatic, regulating, and non-material (cultural) ES. Together,
   exploring UVD-ES patterns in a participatory way helped to reveal
   locally relevant social-ecological drivers of ES and a multidimensional
   perspective of ES trade-offs. Our UVD-ES framework offers an opportunity
   to foster participation as a way to reconnect global environmental
   research agendas with local and regional landscape contexts.},

   major ecosystem changes. A century of fire suppression and climate
   change have set the stage for mega-disturbances that threaten
   biodiversity, human life and values, ecosystem services, and forest
   persistence. Stakeholders face multidimensional and often contentious
   trade-offs with costs and benefits that can be mismatched in space and
   time. If compromises cannot be reached, the status quo is likely to
   continue, resulting in the conversion of large portions of a 100 000
   km(2) predominately mixed-conifer forest ecosystem to a
   chaparral-dominated ecosystem. We describe the outcomes of a
   continuation of the ecological status quo on biodiversity, cultural
   history, fire management, recreational value, and climate control,
   including indirect effects on water and food security and recreation.
   The social-ecological ramifications of such a future are undesirable for
   most stakeholders. Therefore, we contend that forest management
   conflicts should be framed in terms of the cost of failure of
   negotiations among stakeholders. Specifically, negotiations may benefit
   from (1) stakeholders quantifying their definitions of success and
   failure, (2) quantification of trade-offs and recognition of their
   multidimensionality, and (3) allowing for solutions that are
   heterogeneous in space and time. This approach may help stakeholders
   navigate the wicked problem of managing Sierra Nevada forests and other
   complex social-ecological systems.},

Title = {Spatial conservation planning with ecological and economic feedback
   effects},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {237},

Abstract = {Most spatial conservation prioritisations being implemented across the
   globe are based on static approaches to conservation planning. These use
   snapshots of systems to support decision-making. However, ignoring the
   dynamic nature of systems can result in misleading spatial
   prioritisations and missed opportunities to encourage participation in
   conservation programmes. Using a modelling approach, we show that
   integrating economic and ecological feedbacks into conservation planning
   improved social and ecological outcomes. We developed an approach that
   enabled accounting for feedbacks of farmland set-asides using a popular
   conservation planning tool. We empirically assessed the impact of
   ignoring feedbacks on plans to restore the Brazilian Atlantic Forest by
   comparing outcomes of our approach and a widely used static approach.
   The proposed approach attained better conservation outcomes than a
   static approach, at about 7\% lower cost, while also allowing more
   farmers to benefit economically from the set-aside scheme through
   capitalising on the differences between their opportunity costs and the
   amount paid by the scheme. Accounting for feedbacks led to substantially
   different areas being prioritised for farmland set-asides, and to more
   farmers being included in the set-aside scheme. These results show
   important benefits from understanding, and then working with, feedbacks
   that inevitably accompany large-scale conservation interventions. Our
   approach is the first to integrate both environmental and economic
   feedbacks into spatial conservation planning, and model information rent
   capture. In doing so, it demonstrates how existing economic incentives
   can be used to encourage farmers to join a conservation set-aside, while
   still resulting in a lower overall intervention cost.},

Abstract = {Governing common pool resources (CPR) in the face of disturbances such
   as globalization and climate change is challenging. The outcome of any
   CPR governance regime is the influenced by local combinations of social,
   institutional, and biophysical factors, as well as cross-scale
   interdependencies. In this study, we take a step towards understanding
   multiple-causation of CPR outcomes by analyzing (1) the co-occurrence of
   design principles (DPs) by activity (irrigation, fishery and forestry),
   and (2) the combination(s) of DPs leading to social and ecological
   success. We analyzed 69 cases pertaining to three different activities:
   irrigation, fishery, and forestry. We find that the importance of the
   design principles is dependent upon the natural and hard human made
   infrastructure (i.e. canals, equipment, vessels etc.). For example,
   clearly defined social boundaries are important when the natural
   infrastructure is highly mobile (i.e. tuna fish), while monitoring is
   more important when the natural infrastructure is more static (i.e.
   forests or water contained within an irrigation system). However, we
   also find that congruence between local conditions and rules and
   proportionality between investment and extraction are key for CPR
   success independent from the natural and human hard made infrastructure.
   We further provide new visualization techniques for co-occurrence
   patterns and add to qualitative comparative analysis by introducing a
   reliability metric to deal with a large meta-analysis dataset on
   secondary data where information is missing or uncertain.},

Title = {How can social-ecological system models simulate the emergence of
   social-ecological crises?},
Journal = {PEOPLE AND NATURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {88-103},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {1. The idea that human impacts on natural systems might trigger
   large-scale, social-ecological `crises' or `breakdowns' is attracting
   increasing scientific, societal and political attention, but the risks
   of such crises remain hard to assess or ameliorate.
   2. Social-ecological systems have complex dynamics, with bifurcations,
   nonlinearities and tipping points all emerging from the interaction of
   multiple human and natural processes. Computational modelling is a key
   tool in understanding these processes and their effects on system
   resilience. However, models that operate over large geographical extents
   often rely on assumptions such as economic equilibrium and optimisation
   in social-economic systems, and mean-field or trend-based behaviour in
   ecological systems, which limit the simulation of crisis dynamics.
   3. Alternative forms of modelling focus on simulating local-scale
   processes that underpin the dynamics of social-ecological systems.
   Recent improvements in data resources and computational tools mean that
   such modelling is now technically feasible across large geographical
   extents.
   4. We consider the contributions that the different types of model can
   make to simulating social-ecological crises. While no models are able to
   predict exact outcomes in complex social-ecological systems, we suggest
   that one new approach with substantial promise is hybrid modelling that
   uses existing model architectures to isolate and understand key
   processes, revealing risks and associated uncertainties of crises
   emerging. We outline convergent and efficient functional descriptions of
   social and ecological systems that can be used to develop such models,
   data resources that can support them, and possible `high-level'
   processes that they can represent.},

Title = {Landscape sustainability and the landscape ecology of institutions},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},
Number = {11, SI},
Pages = {2613-2628},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Context Landscape sustainability emerges from interactions between
   linked human and natural systems. Many of these interactions are
   mediated by institutions (e.g., rules, laws, customs, traditions), most
   of which are themselves spatially defined entities that both generate
   and respond to spatial variation in the landscape. However, the spatial
   dynamics of the interplay between institutions and landscape
   heterogeneity are poorly understood. Objective To define the landscape
   ecology of institutions as an emerging research field, providing a
   summary of key themes and frontiers. Methods We draw on existing theory
   in both landscape ecology and institutional analysis to explore the
   interface between landscape ecology and institutions in
   social-ecological systems. Results Three central themes in understanding
   landscape sustainability through an institutional lens include the role
   of landscape heterogeneity as a driver of institutions; the spatial
   properties of institutions as influences on ecological and socioeconomic
   processes; and the relationships between institutions and landscape
   resilience. Emerging frontiers for further research include
   understanding the roles of top-down vs bottom up processes (design vs.
   emergence); understanding landscapes as institutional filters; the role
   of landscapes in institutional development and change; and
   co-evolutionary dynamics between landscapes and institutions. We discuss
   each of these points in detail. Conclusions Spatially mediated feedbacks
   between landscape structure and institutions are poorly understood and
   critical for landscape sustainability. Further research in this area
   will depend heavily on generating data sets that describe the spatial
   properties of institutions and allow them to be analysed as landscape
   features.},

Title = {People or place? An exploration of social and ecological drivers of
   urban forest species composition},
Journal = {URBAN ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Number = {5},
Pages = {887-901},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Urban forests have garnered increasing attention as providers of an
   array of beneficial ecosystem services. However, urban forest ecosystems
   are highly complex and heterogeneous systems whose structure are shaped
   by interacting social and ecological processes. Approaches to reliably
   identify and differentiate these processes could be valuable for
   addressing complexity and reducing uncertainty in decision-making in
   urban forestry. The purpose of this study is to identify and quantify a
   range of social and ecological drivers of urban forest species
   composition, distribution, and diversity. This was done using
   hierarchical cluster analysis and discriminant analysis with empirical
   plot data describing the tree species composition in Toronto, Canada.
   Tree density and imperviousness were by far the most influential drivers
   of species composition. Increasing imperviousness saw not just reduced
   tree density but a decline in native species abundance. Additionally,
   single-detached housing, homeownership, and income were closely
   associated and explained higher tree densities and abundances of native
   species. However, income had a lower than expected influence on urban
   forest species composition given its importance in canopy cover
   research. Continuous forest patches were highly distinct compared to the
   remainder of the urban landscape, which highlights the ecological
   distinctiveness of residual forests within cities and lends support to
   their conservation. Increasing the understanding of social and
   ecological drivers of tree species composition, distribution, and
   diversity within cities is an integral part of urban forest ecosystem
   classification, which can be a valuable decision-support tool for
   ecosystem-based management in urban forestry.},

Title = {System Properties Determine Food Security and Biodiversity Outcomes at
   Landscape Scale: A Case Study from West Flores, Indonesia},

Abstract = {The food-biodiversity nexus is a concept that defines and characterizes
   the complex interactions between agricultural systems and biodiversity
   conservation. Here we use a social-ecological systems approach that
   combines fuzzy cognitive mapping and graph theoretic analyses to uncover
   system properties that determine food security and biodiversity outcomes
   at a landscape scale. We studied a rice-based agricultural landscape
   system situated in Mbeliling district of West Flores, Indonesia. A
   graphical representation of the Mbeliling district food-biodiversity
   nexus was created by local experts. The representation revealed system
   properties that help reconcile the trade-offs between food security and
   biodiversity conservation. The graph represented a diverse set of food
   security and biodiversity nodes, and showed that there is not a simple
   dichotomy between `production and protection'. The analysis captured
   greater complexity than popular academic concepts such as land
   sparing-land sharing or sustainable intensification. Three major themes
   emerged from the graph. We found distinct clusters of factors
   influencing biodiversity and food security. We named these sources of
   influence (1) Modernisation and sustainable farming; (2) Knowledge and
   management; and (3) Governance and processes. Component 2 was the most
   representative of emergent system properties that contribute positively
   to managing a sustainable food-biodiversity nexus in the Mbeliling
   landscape. The key determinants of outcomes were: improving agronomic
   practices, diversifying production, maintaining forest cover and
   connectivity, and using knowledge and natural resource management
   processes to mitigate the main drivers of change. Our approach
   highlights the complexities in the food-biodiversity nexus, and could
   have wide application in other locations.},

Title = {Stochasticity-induced persistence in coupled social-ecological systems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {542},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {Stochasticity is often associated with negative consequences for
   population dynamics since a population may die out due to random chance
   during periods when population size is very low (stochastic fade-out).
   Here we develop a coupled social-ecological model based on stochastic
   differential equations that includes natural expansion and harvesting of
   a forest ecosystem, and dynamics of conservation opinions, social norms
   and social learning in a human population. Our objective was to identify
   mechanisms that influence long-term persistence of the forest ecosystem
   in the presence of noise. We found that most of the model parameters had
   a significant influence on the time to extinction of the forest
   ecosystem. Increasing the social learning rate and the net benefits of
   conservation significantly increased the time to extinction, for
   instance. Most interestingly, we found a parameter regime where an
   increase in the amount of system stochasticity caused an increase in the
   mean time to extinction, instead of causing stochastic fade-out. This
   effect occurs for a subset of realizations, but the effect is large
   enough to increase the mean time to extinction across all realizations.
   Such ``stochasticity-induced persistence{''} occurs when stochastic
   dynamics in the social system generates benefits in the forest system at
   crucial points in its temporal dynamics. We conclude that studying
   relatively simple social-ecological models has the benefit of
   facilitating characterization of dynamical states and thereby enabling
   us to formulate new hypothesis about mechanisms that could be operating
   in empirical social-ecological systems. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All

   A Review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Pages = {43-92},
Abstract = {We provide a cartography of 319 bioeconomic models applied to
   terrestrial habitats by combining a quantitative analysis of
   methodological criteria and the narratives underlying the equations.
   Based on a multiple correspondence analysis and clustering techniques,
   our cartography is organized in four groups. Two of them adopt a
   conservation perspective: while the first one focuses on how to
   efficiently preserve species given a limited budget through a
   cost-effectiveness approach without any biodiversity monetarization, the
   second one stands for a second generation of models tackling
   habitat-based conservation measures with specific applications in
   agriculture and forestry. The last two groups are concerned with the
   notion of harvesting. Biodiversity is here monetized and the problem is
   framed as the maximization of the utility of agents derived from the
   flow of the biodiversity variable raising thus a cost-benefit problem.
   While the notion of harvesting is mostly applied to endangered species
   and invasive species in one group, a specific interest for forestry
   characterizes the second one. The temporal analysis of the database
   shows that bioeconomic models applied to terrestrial social-ecological
   systems exhibit an overall recent and ongoing decline. We discuss this
   result regarding the neighboring methods, especially the correlative and
   datadriven models. Since a diversity of modeling frameworks is needed to
   investigate the management of social-ecological systems, especially to
   embrace different understandings and decrease uncertainty, we provide
   some challenges for the future of mathematically based bioeconomic
   models.},

Title = {Exploring linked ecological and cultural tipping points in Mongolia},
Journal = {ANTHROPOCENE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {46-69},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We review evidence of Holocene climate, vegetation, and cultural changes
   in Mongolia and critically examine evidence that Mongolia's steppes are
   at the brink of ecological and cultural tipping points in the
   Anthropocene. Until 5,000 YBP there is no evidence of lasting human
   influences on ecosystems, but after this time, changes in vegetation and
   soil physical properties signal domestic livestock grazing impacts on
   steppe ecosystems.
   Contemporary (1991-2015) literature and region by region analysis of
   climate, livestock, remotesensing and human population data reveal two
   potential tipping points. Temperatures warmed across the 5 regions.
   Since 1991, livestock densities and forage use increased in most
   regions, the spatial distribution of grazing pressure is more
   heterogeneous, and variability increased in stocking densities, forage
   use and forage production in all or most regions. Substantial plant
   species shifts and losses occurred in the mountain and forest steppe
   regions. Although a large proportion of Mongolia's rangelands are
   altered from their ecological potential, few have crossed an
   irreversible threshold of ecological change. Rangelands in Mongolia's
   Khangai, northern and central regions may be approaching an ecological
   tipping point if grazing pressure is not reduced. After 1991, herder
   populations initially rose and then decreased significantly across most
   regions. If demographic and social trends contribute to loss of herding
   knowledge and identity, a cultural tipping point could occur. We
   describe four potential future scenarios that could unfold if these
   tipping points are reached, hypothesize feedbacks between ecological and
   cultural thresholds, and discuss implications for policy and management.

Abstract = {Context Human-dominated landscapes in the tropics need to be managed for
   biodiversity and the maintenance of ecosystem services (ES).
   Nevertheless, integrating both biodiversity conservation and ES
   management remains a challenge. Objectives This study aimed to quantify
   woody plant species diversity and associated ES in farmland and forests,
   and investigate the relationship between species and ES diversity.
   Methods The study was conducted in southwestern Ethiopia. We surveyed
   woody plants in 181 20 m by 20 m plots in farmland, forest with, and
   forest without coffee management. We also interviewed 180 randomly
   selected households about woody plant benefits. We then (a) quantified
   species and ES diversity; and (b) investigated the relationship between
   species and ES diversity. Results We recorded 128 woody plant species in
   total. Most ES were available in all land uses, although they differed
   in their mean availability. ES composition was significantly different
   among land uses. ES diversity was positively related with species
   diversity in all land uses. Conclusions Our findings suggest that all
   examined land-use types were multifunctional in terms of key ES provided
   by woody plants and that maintaining high species diversity also
   benefits ES diversity. Given these findings, we suggest to: (1)
   strengthen landscape multifunctionality by drawing on the positive
   relationship between biodiversity and ES diversity; (2) devise
   conservation policies that encompass entire landscape mosaics and
   enhance co-benefits of conservation and ES provision across land uses;
   and (3) conduct further social-ecological studies that use mixed data to
   elicit socially relevant relationships between biodiversity and ES
   diversity.},

Title = {The Legacy of Hurricanes, Historic Land Cover, and Municipal Ordinances
   on Urban Tree Canopy in Florida (United States)},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) greatly enhances the livability of cities by
   reducing urban heat buildup, mitigating stormwater runoff, and filtering
   airborne particulates, among other ecological services. These benefits,
   combined with the relative ease of measuring tree cover from aerial
   imagery, have led many cities to adopt management strategies based on
   UTC goals. In this study, we conducted canopy analyses for 300 cities in
   Florida to assess the impacts of development practices, urban forest
   ordinances, and hurricanes on tree cover. Within the cities sampled, UTC
   ranged from 5.9 to 68.7\% with a median canopy coverage of 32.3\% Our
   results indicate that the peak gust speeds recorded during past
   hurricanes events were a significant predictor of canopy coverage (P =
   0.001) across the sampled cities. As peak gust speeds increased from 152
   km/h (i.e., a lower-intensity Category 1 storm) to 225 km/h
   (lower-intensity Category 4 and the maximum gusts captured in our data),
   predicted canopy in developed urban areas decreased by 7.7\%. Beyond the
   impacts of hurricanes and tropical storms, we found that historic
   landcover and two out of eight urban forest ordinances were significant
   predictors of existing canopy coverage (P-landcover < 0.001; P-tree
   preservation ordinance = 0.02, P-heritage tree ordinance = 0.03).
   Results indicate that some local policies and tree protections can
   potentially impact urban tree canopy, even in the face of rapid
   development and periodic natural disturbances.},

Title = {A review of successes, challenges, and lessons from Indigenous protected
   and conserved areas},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {241},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Indigenous Peoples' protected and conserved areas have gained global
   attention due to growing interest in protecting biodiversity during a
   time of Indigenous resurgence. We reviewed the academic literature to
   synthesize the motivations, successes, challenges, and lessons from
   protected and conserved areas led by Indigenous Peoples globally. We
   found and analyzed 58 papers, describing 86 specific initiatives
   involving at least 68 Indigenous Peoples across 25 countries. We found
   that Indigenous Peoples established protected and conserved areas
   independently and through local- and broad-scale partnerships. States
   that supported such efforts did so through formal legislation,
   agreements, and policies, and informally through local relationships and
   shared values. Indigenous Peoples' protected and conserved areas created
   socio-cultural, political, and ecological benefits such as improving
   Indigenous livelihoods, increasing governance and management capacities,
   and improving species populations and habitat protection. However, some
   challenges (e.g. restrictive legislations, burdensome partnerships,
   insufficient funding) limited benefits, and demanded additional
   capacities and resources for mitigation. We recommend that states and
   other external actors: create and improve policies, legislations, and
   resources for Indigenous Peoples' protected and conserved areas as
   defined by Indigenous Peoples; provide resources and facilitate
   Indigenous leadership to shape external mechanisms for protected area
   establishment and development; and create new internal mechanisms for
   Indigenous engagement and partnerships. Indigenous Peoples would benefit
   from building partnerships to support and manage their areas. Finally,
   we suggest that managers commit more resources to effectively monitor
   and manage these areas, including integrating management priorities with
   local and larger scale socio-cultural and environmental issues that
   affect these areas.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Designing policies for the sustainable development of social-ecological
   systems with complex human-land relations requires integrated management
   and nexus thinking; China's national parks are typical social-ecological
   systems. Ecosystem services and community livelihood are two essential
   components of sustainable management in the nature-community nexus
   (NCN). This study focuses on the Qianjiangyuan National Park Pilot Area
   in eastern China. Following a systems approach and integrating
   qualitative (causal analysis and systems but dynamic methods) and
   quantitative (InVEST model, Spearman's correlation analysis, regression
   analysis, and multiple correspondence analysis) methods, we developed
   two causal mechanisms linking livelihood assets and ecosystem services,
   and verified them by exploring multi-dimensional linkages and revealing
   two types of NCNs. Results showed that the proportions of cropland and
   orchard areas have significant negative correlations with water and soil
   retention services, respectively, while forests significantly benefit
   both services. A positive NCN exists in areas where water and soil
   retention services perform well and the local community develops
   vibrantly with a considerable proportion of young, highly educated, or
   high-income (especially the income from secondary industries) residents.
   A negative NCN is seen in areas where the water and soil retention
   services values are low; a great many households do not have substantial
   income from secondary and tertiary industries, and few households have
   vast forest areas. These results can be used as scientific evidence for
   optimizing institutional arrangements and contributing to sustainable
   and harmonious development of national parks in China.},

Title = {Bridging the divide between rural and urban community-based forestry: A
   bibliometric review},
Journal = {FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {144},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Community-based forest management takes myriad forms, including
   community forestry, urban and community forestry, and joint forest
   management. These variations are all implemented with a promise to
   include local communities (to varying degrees) in forest decision-making
   and management, but distinctions are often made between rural versus
   urban focused research and practice. Such distinctions may be arbitrary
   and increasingly unnecessary, as rural and urban communities exist on a
   continuum. To understand whether there is a measurable divide between
   urban and rural community forestry scholarship, we conduct a systematic
   bibliometric analysis including examining co-citation networks, citation
   counts, and keywords. We find there is a multi-dimensional divide
   between the scholars studying community-based forestry in rural and
   urban focused contexts, including in terms of discipline, topics of
   focus, and the intellectual foundations of each community. The
   separation we find between urban and rural community-based forest
   research represents an opportunity to explore where researchers and
   practitioners typically isolated in rural or urban research may learn
   from and connect with each other. Ultimately, we argue that
   community-based forestry cannot achieve its potential to improve forests
   and reduce inequality without increased connections between scholars and
   practitioners from the often siloed rural and urban communities.
   Connecting these communities will require increased collaboration
   between natural and social scientists and increased attention to the
   research needs of practitioners and local communities, which we argue
   may help facilitate more just forest governance.},

Title = {Ecosystem-based management revisited: Updating the concepts for urban
   forests},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {186},
Pages = {24-35},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The concept of ecosystem-based management (EBM) emerged from growing
   concern around adverse environmental impacts associated with resource
   management in the late twentieth century. Despite inconsistencies and
   ambiguities in both definition and implementation, the concept has seen
   considerable uptake in federal and provincial/state policies. More
   recently, municipal urban forest plans and programs have been making
   reference to EBM, yet there is almost no existing research on EBM in
   urban settings. In this paper, we discuss EBM in the context of urban
   forest ecosystems. Specifically, we ask three questions: (1) how might
   the concept of EBM remain relevant and be applied in densely-populated
   urban settings; (2) what structure and form might EBM take in the
   management of urban forest ecosystems; and (3) what are some examples of
   EBM applications in municipal urban forestry? The review is structured
   around 10 prominent themes from the EBM literature, which are
   re-negotiated for the urban context and, where necessary, are altered,
   omitted, or replaced with new themes. We also draw from four
   complementary cases of EBM in practice in Halifax, Toronto, and
   Edmonton. The resulting 12 themes of urban forest EBM include:
   Resilience, hierarchical context, social-ecological boundaries, data and
   information management, monitoring, adaptive management, interagency
   cooperation, partnerships and civic engagement, organizational change,
   social change, environmental justice, and values. Urban forests are
   important ecosystem service providers, but managers face a host of
   challenges, ranging from a consistent lack of resources to degraded
   urban sites. Continued dialogue on best approaches for integrating
   ecological principles into management is essential.},

Title = {Contrasting perspectives on mangroves in arid Northwestern Mexico:
   Implications for integrated coastal management},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {54},
Number = {4},
Pages = {318-329},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Mangroves in Northwestern Mexico are vital to maintain coastal
   environments healthy, to provide nutrients for several food chains, and
   to supply valuable goods and services that sustain and improve human
   livelihoods. Many of these values offer a range of opportunities for
   economic development that attract workers, investors and developers.
   Recently, federal privatization policies have promoted an accelerated
   coastal development of this region to obtain large profits in short
   times, creating competing and overlapping interests to use coastal
   environments and control key resources. Such intense developments are
   modifying the ecological conditions of many coastal areas, threatening
   the provision of important ecosystem services to society. After years of
   centralized decisions, new paradigms are needed to achieve a coastal
   management that ensures long-term ecosystem maintenance, fair resource
   use and social equity. Recognizing the multiplicity of actors involved
   in coastal management and using a qualitative research methodology, we
   identified and explored the perspectives of different key stakeholders
   in the states of Baja California Sur and Sonora, Mexico, to better
   understand their views on mangroves use and management as well as the
   interaction among them. We discuss similarities and/or discrepancies
   found among stakeholders' perceptions by describing their central ideas
   and identifying overlapping interests that may create conflicts when
   defining development and conservation programs or formulating policies.
   This information also intends to encourage further research on the
   social-ecological system of the coasts in Northwestern Mexico and to
   contribute to address coastal management issues in integrated ways that
   consider the social dimension through documenting stakeholders'
   narratives in the future. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Fire-Regulating Services and Disservices With an Application to the
   Haifa-Carmel Region in Israel},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JUL 4},
Abstract = {In the Mediterranean region, and in other fire-prone areas of the globe,
   human and economic losses due to forest fires have increased in the past
   decades, particularly at the urban-wildland interface. To counter this
   trend, economic and human resources are generally invested to combat and
   suppress wildfires, with much less invested to adapt through
   ecosystem-based management. Ecosystem services for fire regulation are
   rarely accounted for in the literature and are generally excluded from
   ecosystem service classifications. This gap causes fire-regulating
   services to be overlooked in socio-ecological assessments and in
   economic valuations, potentially further hampering the design and
   implementation of ecosystem-based approaches. We review the literature
   on fire risk reduction related to ecosystem management to define and
   characterize fire-regulating services and disservices. We then suggest
   indicators for the assessment of these services and disservices, and we
   propose a conceptual framework linking fire risk, ecosystem services,
   and ecosystem management practices. In the second part of the paper, we
   apply these concepts to the historical development of the
   social-ecological system of the Haifa-Mount Carmel region in Israel,
   including pre- and post-fire forest management practices. To inform the
   case study we investigate reports, relevant scientific articles, and
   policy documents, all corroborated with information from expert lectures
   on the topic. We conclude by suggesting that human capital should become
   an integral part of the description and definition of fire-regulating
   services and disservices, especially for highly modified urban and
   peri-urban environments.},

Abstract = {How to create and adjust governing institutions so that they align (fit)
   with complex ecosystem processes and structures across scales is an
   issue of increasing concern in conservation. It is argued that lack of
   such social-ecological fit makes governance and conservation difficult,
   yet progress in explicitly defining and rigorously testing what
   constitutes a good fit has been limited. We used a novel modeling
   approach and data from case studies of fishery and forest conservation
   to empirically test presumed relationships between conservation outcomes
   and certain patterns of alignment of social-ecological interdependences.
   Our approach made it possible to analyze conservation outcome on a
   systems level while also providing information on how individual actors
   are positioned in the complex web of social-ecological
   interdependencies. We found that when actors who shared resources were
   also socially linked, conservation at the level of the whole
   social-ecological system was positively affected. When the scales at
   which individual actors used resources and the scale at which ecological
   resources were interconnected to other ecological resources were aligned
   through tightened feedback loops, conservation outcome was better than
   when they were not aligned. The analysis of individual actors' positions
   in the web of social-ecological interdependencies was helpful in
   understanding why a system has a certain level of social-ecological fit.
   Results of analysis of positions showed that different actors
   contributed in very different ways to achieve a certain fit and revealed
   some underlying difference between the actors, for example in terms of
   actors' varying rights to access and use different ecological resources.},

Title = {Trends in agroforestry research over 4 decades},
Journal = {ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {Agroforestry has a high potential to contribute to climate change
   mitigation and adaptation as a nature-based climate solution and is
   increasingly included as a climate strategy in international agreements
   and national plans. Yet, how to equitably increase and sustain
   agroforestry on the scale needed to meet these targets remains unclear.
   Examining broad trends in the existing 4 decades of agroforestry
   literature can highlight gaps and opportunities for future research that
   enables agroforestry transitions. Using text analytics and a full-text,
   corpus-based approach, we analyzed changes in word use in 9,664
   agroforestry research articles and reports published between 1980 and
   2020 with regard to 4 key themes of the social dimensions of
   agroforestry transitions: (1) agreements and policies; (2) scales and
   decision-making agents; (3) knowledge, culture, and equity; and (4)
   frameworks and methods. We then compared the frequency of these themes
   in research articles and reports. Despite the most frequently used terms
   across all 4 decades being primarily ecological (e.g., forest, species,
   soil), the lexicon of agroforestry literature has expanded to
   incorporate more social, economic, and political elements (e.g.,
   livelihood, knowledge, community) over time, and as agroforestry has
   become more central to climate change adaptation and mitigation targets.
   Trends in the frequency of several terms (e.g., biodiversity,
   development, climate) corresponded with the signing of intergovernmental
   agreements, illustrating the responsiveness of the field to global
   priorities. Reports had a higher frequency of terms related to social
   themes than research articles. We discuss the implications of these
   emergent trends and opportunities for future research in support of
   sustainable and just agroforestry transitions.},

Title = {Moving from ecological impacts to social vulnerability in data-scarce
   places},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {354},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Managers need to trace social impacts and vulnerability caused by
   environmental change all the way to its driving forces to target key
   system components for intervention. However, most available scientific
   evidence deals with either the ecological impacts of direct drivers or
   the value of ecosystem benefits to people. Our matrixbased tool combines
   these types of evidence to make environmental management problems
   traceable through a structured yet flexible procedure. The tool consists
   of a series of matrices that sequentially link direct drivers of
   environmental change, landscapes, ecological conditions, benefits to
   people, and stakeholder types. Qualitative matrices result from the
   integration and synthesis of available evidence from literature reviews,
   and where data is scarce, these are used to elicit quantitative scores
   from expert opinion. Expert scoring of links and multiplication of
   matrices allow for estimating the impacts of each driver of
   environmental change on each stakeholder type and using this information
   as input to assess stakeholders' vulnerability through impact -influence
   diagrams. Applying the tool to the Argentine Gran Chaco, a globally
   threatened ecoregion, yielded a transparent and reliable picture of this
   data-scarce place, with important management implications. Tracing
   stakeholder impacts back to direct drivers confirmed that further
   encroachment of cleared areas around indigenous lands will increase the
   vulnerability of this social group. Also, assessing confidence levels
   for every social-ecological link suggested that incentivizing peasant
   farmers to restore natural forage supply represents a management
   opportunity to reverse degradation. Our tool makes interdisciplinary
   frameworks of linked ecological and social systems operational so
   managers can use the best available knowledge of a place and account for
   uncertainty to make environmental management decisions.},

Title = {Soil health and management matters: A survey of field tree nursery
   producers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {331},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Extensive calls for increased tree planning worldwide are highlighting
   the need for management changes in the field tree nursery sector.
   Healthy soil is the foundation for sustainable agricultural systems, and
   best practices for soil management confer tangible benefits to producers
   as well as broader system-wide benefits. However, field tree producers
   lack the foundational resources needed to implement, manage, and
   evaluate soil health practices within their operations. Furthermore,
   tree producers are unique in that their primary product is central to
   the sustainable development of urban spaces and are facing increased
   demand for high-quality trees. There is sub-sequently a two-pronged
   need. First, a greater understanding of the key objectives,
   opportunities, and challenges driving soil management in tree production
   is required to support the development of specified practices, within
   the sector. Second, a greater characterization of the short-and
   long-term value of trees is required to incentivize the soil health
   practices that will support resilience in tree production systems. The
   study characterizes the soil health and management practices implemented
   in Ontario by field tree nursery producers. A questionnaire was
   administered in the summer of 2020 to Ontario tree nursery producers
   within the Landscape Ontario Horti-cultural Trades Association (N = 29).
   Responding producers provided insight into soil management practices,
   opportunities and challenges. Tree nursery producers expressed a need
   for resources to support cover crop usage and comprehensive soil testing
   to improve tree performance. Reflection on current soil management
   challenges and opportunities highlights the benefits of considering soil
   management as one aspect within the broader social -ecological system.},

Title = {Reviewing social-ecological resilience for agroforestry systems under
   climate change conditions},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {869},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Global change is shaping social-ecological systems, threatening both
   natural and socio-economic ecosystems as a whole. Landscapes with
   combined nature-human interactions are particularly vulnerable to
   changing climatic conditions. Therefore, there is a need to find viable
   and practical solutions for the preservation and recovery of the
   affected systems. A relevant way to cope with disturbances is to promote
   social-ecological resilience through the use of strategies targeting the
   social-ecological system as a whole, in order to ensure an efficient
   self-reorganization of a landscape. This study presents a research
   innovation by clarifying the concept of social-ecological resilience
   while being focused on providing a useful tool for landscape managers.
   For doing so, the research first defines social-ecological resilience
   and aims to give a clear idea of its characteristics and application
   features. Second, it explains the importance of social-ecological
   resilience for landscapes, focusing on the relationship of humans with
   nature and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) for biodiversity
   conservation. Third, it proposes guidelines and measures for the
   promotion and enhancement of social-ecological resilience. The outcomes
   of the study show a broad perspective on the concept of
   social-ecological resilience to understand the necessary adaptation to
   global change. As findings, this research highlights the significance of
   nature-human interactions for agroforestry systems, citing also the
   potential contribution that digital innovation can play for the
   conservation of those interactions in a sustainable way. Moreover, it
   uncovers the key role of local communities in building social-ecological
   resilience through the application of a variety of described strategies
   that can have a relevant impact and be useful for landscape management
   practices to face upcoming challenges linked to climate change.},

   various operationalisations it either treats the former as a black box
   or it fails to capture dynamic aspects. We address these limits and
   develop a Dialectical Socio-Ecological System (D-SES) framework, which
   combines process ecology with historical materialism, to describe the
   emergence and persistence of capitalist dynamics. We draw on data
   collected through fieldwork and desk research and deploy our framework
   to study capital-intensive agriculture in the Chaco Salteno, an
   important agricultural frontier in South America, obtaining some general
   insights. We open up the socio-economic subsystem and break it down into
   a lower-level material/economic sphere and an upper-level
   cultural/institutional sphere. Capitalist dynamics emerge out of the
   peculiar relationships occurring both within and between these spheres.
   This configuration shows the typical signs of autocatalysis. It attracts
   resources and capital to expand itself (centripetality). It becomes more
   complex and organised over time, fine-tuning production modes, cultures,
   and institutions (directionality). It is subject to the laws of
   competition and profit maximisation, which emerge independently from the
   individual actors and processes making up the system (autonomy).
   Finally, it engenders frictions, reflecting class antagonism between the
   direct producers and the appropriators of wealth. These frictions can
   become leverage points for a system's transformation.},

Title = {Comparison between best-response dynamics and replicator dynamics in a
   social-ecological model of lake eutrophication},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {509},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {Social-ecological models are often used to investigate the mutual
   interactions between an ecological system and human behaviour at a
   collective level. The social system is widely represented either by the
   replicator dynamics or by the best-response dynamics. We investigate the
   consequences of choosing one or the other with the example of a
   social-ecological model for eutrophication in shallow lakes, where the
   anthropogenic discharge of pollutants into the water is determined by a
   behavioural model using the replicator or a best-response dynamics. We
   discuss a fundamental difference between the replicator dynamics and the
   logit formulation of the best-response dynamics. This fundamental
   difference results in a different number of equilibria. We show that the
   replicator equation is a limit case of the best-response model, when
   agents are assumed to behave with infinite rationality. If agents act
   less rationally in the model using the best-response dynamics, the
   correspondence with the model using the replicator dynamics decreases.
   Finally, we show that sustained oscillations observed in both cases may
   differ substantially. The replicator dynamics makes the amplitude of the
   limit cycle become larger and makes the system come closer to full
   cooperation or full defection. Thus, the dynamics along the limit cycle
   imply a different risk for the system to be pushed by a perturbation
   into a desirable or an undesirable outcome depending on the
   socioeconomic dynamics assumed in the model. When analyzing
   social-ecological models, the choice of a socioeconomic dynamics is
   often little justified but our results show that it may have dramatic
   impacts on the coupled human-environment system. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Tracing environmental and livelihood dynamics in a tropical coastal
   lagoon through the lens of multiple adaptive cycles},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Understanding the long-term dynamics of social-ecological systems is
   critical to better inform sustainable management. Since Holling's
   adaptive cycle heuristic, published in 2001, substantial progress has
   been made to explore historical changes in agricultural, pastoral, and
   forest systems. However, the application of this heuristic in coastal
   fishery systems has been relatively rare. Using the Tam Giang Lagoon in
   Vietnam as an example of a rapidly changing environment, we explore the
   historical behavior of this tropical coastal social-ecological system
   (SES), associated livelihood pathways, and possible challenges for
   future livelihood adaptations through the lens of the adaptive cycle
   metaphor. Our analysis demonstrates that the present lagoon SES
   condition is the result of a series of historical events and
   reorganization attempts through two complete adaptive cycles. The
   lagoon's future vulnerability is tied to the intensification of human
   uses, prolonged ecological degradation, and intensifying climatic
   hazards. We show how the evolution of the lagoon SES resulted in
   divergent livelihood pathways that bring benefits to some users but also
   cause persistent constraints and sometimes irreversible losses to other
   users in shared common pool resources. A one-size-fits-all fishery
   management approach is therefore ill-suited for improving diverse
   livelihoods. We recommend that fishery policies take seriously the
   heterogeneity in livelihood pathways for sustainable lagoon management.
   We end by reflecting on the usefulness of the adaptive cycle heuristic
   in systematically exploring historical dynamics and identifying
   underlying drivers and feedbacks between the social and ecological
   components of complex fishery systems.},

Title = {Reframing ecosystem management in the era of climate change: Issues and
   knowledge from forests},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {165},
Pages = {115-127},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Climate change is one of the significant concerns in land and resource
   management, creating an urgent need to build social-ecological capacity
   to address widespread and uncertain environmental changes. Given the
   diversity and complexity of ecological responses to climate change
   ``ecosystem management{''} approaches are needed to provide solutions
   for meeting both ecological and human needs, while reducing
   anthropogenic warming and climate-related impacts on society. For
   instance, ecosystem management can contribute to a reduction in the
   greenhouse gas emissions through improved land-use and reduced
   deforestation at a regional scale. Further, conserving and restoring
   naturally-functioning ecosystems, which is often one of the goals of
   ecosystem management can significantly contribute to buffering
   ecological responses to climate extremes such as droughts and wildfires.
   Moreover, ecosystem management helps build capacity for learning and
   adaptation at multiple scales. As a result, societies will be better
   prepared to respond to surprises and uncertainties associated with
   climate change. In this regard, it is imperative to reframe climate
   change issues based on the ecosystem approach. Although climate change
   and ecosystem management plans have largely developed independently, it
   is now essential for all stakeholders to work together to achieve
   multiple goals. The ecosystem-based approaches can enable flexible and
   effective responses to the uncertainties associated with climate change.
   Reframing ecosystem management helps to face an urgent need for
   reconsideration and improvement of social-ecological resilience in order
   to mitigate and adapt to the changing climate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Reconciling food security and biodiversity conservation: participatory
   scenario planning in southwestern Ethiopia},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Social-ecological systems are complex and involve uncertainties emerging
   from interactions between biophysical and social system components. In
   the face of growing complexity and uncertainty, stakeholder engagement
   with the future is important to proactively manoeuvre toward desirable
   outcomes. Focusing on the interrelated challenges of food security and
   biodiversity conservation, we conducted a participatory scenario
   planning exercise in a rural landscape in southwestern Ethiopia. We
   involved 35 stakeholder organizations in multiple workshops to construct
   causal loop diagrams, elicit critical uncertainties, and draft scenario
   narratives. Jointly, we developed four plausible future scenarios for
   the studied landscape: (1) gain over grain: local cash crops; (2) mining
   green gold: coffee investors; (3) coffee and conservation: a biosphere
   reserve; and (4) food first: intensive farming and forest protection.
   These scenarios differ with respect to their main social-economic
   dynamics as well as their food security and biodiversity outcomes.
   Importantly, three of the four scenarios, i.e., all except ``coffee and
   conservation: a biosphere reserve,{''} focused on increasing efficiency
   in agricultural production through intensification, specialization, and
   market integration. In contrast, ``coffee and conservation: a biosphere
   reserve{''} was driven by agroecological production methods that support
   diversified livelihoods, a multifunctional landscape, maintenance of
   natural capital, a governance system that supports local people, and
   social-ecological resilience. Similar agroecological trajectories have
   been advocated as desirable for sustainable development in numerous
   other smallholder farming systems worldwide. Given fewer trade-offs and
   better equity outcomes, it appears that an agroecological development
   pathway stands a good chance of generating synergies between food
   security and biodiversity conservation. Pathways prioritizing
   agricultural efficiency, in contrast, are more likely to degrade natural
   capital and cause social inequity.},

Title = {Understanding the contribution of wild edible plants to rural
   social-ecological resilience in semi-arid Kenya},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Wild edible plants (WEPs) are known to make important contributions to
   food baskets and livelihoods in the smallholder and subsistence farming
   communities of sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, protecting and promoting
   the sustainable use of WEPs in concert with more mainstream agricultural
   innovation efforts has the potential to build household resilience to
   food insecurity. There is, however, a need to better understand how WEPs
   contribute to rural livelihoods on a daily basis and act as emergency
   safety nets during periods of hunger. Focusing on two villages in rural
   eastern Kenya, we sought to determine which household conditions are
   correlated with household reliance on WEPs as a coping strategy during
   times of food insecurity, while also investigating the role of access
   restrictions on adaptive capacity and the ability to obtain these
   important food resources. Results reveal that reliance on WEPs is
   greater in households that report food insecurity, lack off-farm income,
   and have lower asset levels. Access to WEPs is also a major factor in
   consumption frequency, with smaller farm sizes and increased distance to
   harvest areas significantly correlated with lower levels of WEP use. By
   combining vulnerability and adaptive capacity measures for each
   household, we created a more complete accounting of the factors that
   influence WEP consumption frequency, with implications for policy. This
   study represents an important first step in taking a more holistic view
   of the subsistence value of WEPs and the myriad factors that influence
   households' reliance on, and ability to obtain, uncultivated natural
   resources.},

Title = {An integrated approach to prioritize restoration for carnivore
   conservation in shared landscapes},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {273},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Global land use change has resulted in the loss and fragmentation of
   habitats and amplified the pace of species extinction. With carnivores
   being disproportionately at risk of range contraction, restoration is an
   important strategy to counter the impacts of habitat loss and
   fragmentation. While protection of public lands has been the cornerstone
   of conservation, private lands can play an important supplementary role.
   India harbors 23 \% of the global carnivore species, threatened by a
   rapidly growing economy and high human densities. Using a
   socialecological systems approach, we prioritized private agricultural
   lands for agroforestry in the buffer area of Pench Tiger Reserve. We
   applied systematic conservation planning tools and combined data on (1)
   habitat use of four carnivores (tiger, leopard, dhole, and sloth bear),
   (2) landowner willingness to modify land use through enrolment in an
   incentive-based program, and (3) monetary cost of program
   implementation, to identify priority areas for agroforestry based on
   their relative cost-effectiveness. Our integrated approach generated a
   configuration of priority areas that was markedly different than if we
   selected areas using ecological data only. Over an 8-year period,
   restoration of similar to 4900, similar to 8300 and similar to 12,000
   acres through agroforestry was estimated to have a cumulative cost of
   USD 56 million, USD 95 million, and USD 140 million, respectively.
   Partnering with and incentivizing private landowners can expand the
   effective size of small and fragmented protected areas. Our approach can
   be applied to other shared landscapes, dominated by private ownership,
   to identify areas that deliver a compromise between ecological
   suitability, social acceptability, and economic viability.},

Title = {Participatory planning of a community-based payments for ecosystem
   services initiative in Madagascar's mangroves},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},

Volume = {175},

Abstract = {Although the dynamics of coastal resources are largely determined by the
   impacts of human users, spatially-explicit social data are rarely
   systematically integrated into coastal management planning in data-poor
   developing states. In order to plan a community-based mangrove payments
   for ecosystem services initiative in southwest Madagascar, we used two
   participatory approaches; public participation geographic information
   systems and concept modelling workshops - with 10 coastal communities to
   investigate the dynamics and spatial distribution of the mangrove
   resources they use. In each village we conducted participatory mapping
   of land and resource use with different livelihood groups using printed
   satellite images, and concept modelling workshops to develop concept
   models of the mangrove social-ecological system (including the
   identification of threats and underlying drivers, and proposals for
   targeted management strategies). Each community then proposed mangrove
   zoning consisting of strict conservation zones, sustainable use zones
   and restoration zones. Following validation and ground-truthing, the
   proposed zones and management strategies formed the basis of the zoning
   and management plan for the mangrove. Participatory approaches proved a
   simple and reliable way to gather spatial data and better understand the
   relationships between the mangrove and those who use it. Moreover,
   participation stimulated mangrove users to consider resource trends, the
   impacts of their activities, and required management actions, promoting
   a collective `buy-in' for the project. Since participation extended
   beyond research to the development of management zones, rules and
   strategies, we believe that community ownership of the project has been
   strengthened and the chances of successfully conserving the mangrove
   improved.},

Title = {Conservation in a social-ecological system experiencing climate-induced
   tree mortality},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {192},
Pages = {276-285},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We present a social-ecological framework to provide insight into climate
   adaptation strategies and diverse perspectives on interventions in
   protected areas for species experiencing climate-induced impacts. To
   develop this framework, we examined the current ecological condition of
   a culturally and commercially valuable species, considered the predicted
   future effects of climate change on that species in a protected area,
   and assessed the perspectives held by forest users and managers on
   future adaptive practices. We mapped the distribution of yellow-cedar
   (Callitropsis nootkatensis) and examined its health status in Glacier
   Bay National Park and Preserve by comparing forest structure, tree
   stress-indicators, and associated thermal regimes between forests inside
   the park and forests at the current latitudinal limit of the species
   dieback. Yellow-cedar trees inside the park were healthy and relatively
   unstressed compared to trees outside the park that exhibited reduced
   crown fullness and increased foliar damage. Considering risk factors for
   mortality under future climate scenarios, our vulnerability model
   indicated future expected dieback occurring within park boundaries.
   Interviews with forest users and managers revealed strong support for
   increasing monitoring to inform interventions outside protected areas,
   improving management collaboration across land designations, and using a
   portfolio of interventions on actively managed lands. Study participants
   who perceived humans as separate from nature were more opposed to
   interventions in protected areas. Linking social and ecological
   analyses, our study provides an interdisciplinary approach to identify
   system-specific metrics (e.g., stress indicators) that can better
   connect monitoring with management, and adaptation strategies for
   species impacted by climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Maintenance of socio-cultural values and biodiversity at local and
   regional levels are new important additional criteria for the
   implementation of sustainable forest management. Ukraine's forest sector
   is in transition from planned socialist to market economy. We evaluated
   the role of the traditional village system, which was successful for
   centuries for achieving both common economic as well as these new
   dimensions of sustainable forest management in Ukraine's Carpathian
   Mountains. We used the Skole district as a case study that represents
   one of the most forested areas in Ukraine, and an integral part of Boiko
   people's ethnographic area. The village is a traditional
   social-ecological system defined by the traditional land use of
   pre-industrial cultural landscapes, and a spatial structure with land
   use zones satisfying different needs. Using documents on regional
   environmental history, analysis of socio-economic statistics, and
   interviews with local land users, we evaluated the extent to which the
   traditional village system supports socio-cultural dimensions of
   sustainable forest management. Our review of environmental history
   indicates that after different phases of cultural landscape development
   during several 100 years, the traditional village system is still a
   basic unit of the Skole district's forest landscapes. However, data and
   interviews show that the traditional village system is endangered.
   Making use of the total economic value of forest landscape resources,
   including wood and non-wood products and services based on cultural
   values and biodiversity, is an urgent task. Support of traditional
   village socio-cultural functions and land use systems including fields,
   wooded grasslands and forests should be milestones in a regional program
   of sustainable forest management. Traditional village system zoning and
   land use systems would be good indicators of sustainable forest
   landscapes. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Understanding trends in biological invasions by introduced mammals in

Volume = {46},

Abstract = {Invasive introduced mammals (IIMs) have ecological and social dimensions
   that require holistic research to integrate academic disciplines with
   basic and applied sciences. We assessed current knowledge of IIMs to
   determine trends in their study and management in southern South
   America. A keyword search was used to select indexed papers in the Web
   of Science. These were reviewed to assess each study's objective,
   methodology, country, publication year, and taxa. Unpublished grey'
   literature was added to evaluate further each species' native range,
   year of introduction, the reason for its introduction, its distribution,
   dispersal pathways, impacts, and management. Most of the 190
   peer-reviewed publications were focused on autecology and impacts of
   IIMs; less than 4\% addressed management or social topics. Twenty-three
   IIMs have been documented in the study area. The southern Magellanic
   subpolar forest was the most invaded ecoregion (17 spp.), and the most
   studied orders, from 440 records in 190 papers, were Artiodactyla (35\%)
   and Rodentia (28\%). Together, livestock and commensals brought during
   early European colonisation constituted 44\% of this assemblage, but
   hunting was the major reason behind the introduction of IIMs (30\%). To
   enhance policies and institutional frameworks pertaining to biological
   invasions, we highlight the importance of: 1) recognising the presence
   and spread of IIMs in pristine' or protected areas; 2) improving
   controls to prevent new introductions and escapes; 3) including social
   and cultural aspects of biological invasions in research and management
   plans; 4) reinforcing hunting regulations; 5) establishing long-term
   programmes to monitor distribution and dispersion; 6) creating
   mechanisms for scientists and managers to co-produce research and policy
   programmes oriented towards applied issues; 7) developing pilot
   management projects in critical areas; 8) achieving societal involvement
   in management programmes to ensure public acceptance; and 9) developing
   prioritisation tools, as resources needed to manage IIMs are often
   limited.},

Title = {Addressing complexity and uncertainty: conceptual models and expert
   judgments applied to migratory birds in the oil sands of Canada},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Complexity and uncertainty are inherent in social-ecological systems.
   Although they can create challenges for scientists and decision makers,
   they cannot be a reason for delaying decision making. Two strategies
   have matured in recent decades to address these challenges. Systems
   thinking, as embodied by conceptual modeling, is a holistic approach in
   which a system can be better understood by examining it as a whole.
   Expert elicitation represents a second strategy that enables a greater
   diversity of inputs to understand complex systems. We explored the use
   of conceptual models and expert judgments to inform expansion of
   monitoring around oil sands development in northern Alberta, Canada,
   particularly related to migratory forest birds. This study area is a
   complex social-ecological system for which there is an abundance of
   specific information, but a relatively weak understanding about system
   behavior. Multiple conceptual models were developed to represent
   complexity and provide a more fulsome view of influences across the
   landscape. A hierarchical approach proved useful, and a mechanistic
   structure of the models clarified the cumulative and interactive nature
   of factors within and outside the study area. To address gaps in
   understanding, expert judgments were integrated using a series of
   structured exercises to derive ``weightings{''} of importance of
   different components in the conceptual models, specifically pairwise
   comparisons, Likert scaling, and a maximum difference conjoint approach.
   These exercises were helpful for discriminating the importance of
   different influences and illuminating the competing beliefs of experts.
   Various supporting tools helped us engage a group of experts from across
   North America, which included a virtual meeting, online polling, desktop
   sharing, web survey, and financial incentive. This combination of
   techniques was innovative and proved useful for addressing complexity
   and uncertainty in a specific natural resource management setting, which
   can be informative for others facing similar challenges.},

Title = {Navigating Sustainability: Revealing Hidden Forces in Social-Ecological
   Systems},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {During the 1992 Rio Conference, the sustainable development agenda
   envisioned a transformative change for the management of natural
   resources, where the well-being of human society would be enhanced
   through the sustainable use of natural capital. Several decades on,
   relentless economic growth persists at the expense of natural capital,
   as demonstrated by biodiversity decline, climate change and other
   environmental challenges. Why is this happening and what can be done
   about it? We present three agent-based models that explore the social,
   economic and governance factors driving (un)sustainability in complex
   social-ecological systems. Our modelling results reinforce the idea that
   the current economic system fails to safeguard the natural capital upon
   which it relies, leading to the prevailing decoupling between the
   economic and natural systems. In attempting to find solutions for such
   disjunction, our research shows that social-ecological systems are
   complex, dynamic and non-linear. Interestingly, results also reveal that
   there are common factors to most social-ecological systems that have the
   potential to improve or diminish sustainability: the role of financial
   entities and monetary debt; economic speculation; technological
   development and efficiency; long-term views, tipping point management
   and government interventions; and top-down and bottom-up conservation
   forces. These factors can play a dual role, as they can either undermine
   or enhance sustainability depending on their specific context and
   particular conditions. Therefore, the current economic system may not be
   inherently unsustainable, but rather specific economic mechanisms,
   decision-making processes and the complex links between economic and
   natural systems could be at the root of the problem. We argue that
   short- and medium-term sustainability can be achieved by implementing
   mechanisms that shift capitalist forces to support environmental
   conservation. Long-term sustainability, in contrast, requires a more
   profound paradigm shift: the full integration and accounting of
   externalities and natural capital into the economy.},

Title = {Modeling fine scale urchin and kelp dynamics: Implications for
   management of the Maine sea urchin fishery},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {141},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {107-117},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The Maine sea urchin fishery is a classic boom-bust fishery in which
   efforts to sustain the resource failed despite the creation of a
   co-management system. We report on ethnographic work undertaken to
   assist in the development of a fine scale model of the natural system of
   this fishery. The development of the natural system model required
   understanding the key linkages between the biology and ecology of the
   sea urchin and the behavior of fishermen. Information was gathered from
   the primary scientific literature and from interviews with sea urchin
   industry members and scientists. Urchin-kelp interactions at a very fine
   scale create patchy, almost sedentary aggregations of urchins.
   Settlement of larval urchins appears to be ubiquitous; however, after
   settlement patches of urchins operate as nearly independent demographic
   units. In the short term - months to several years - the abundance of
   urchins in any patch and the spatial dynamics within these patches are
   determined largely by the actions of fishermen. Consequently, the
   resource can be characterized as a dynamic fitness landscape in which
   the spatial structure of urchin patches is the principal determinant of
   fishermen's harvesting strategies and fishermen's activities are the
   principal determinant of the spatial structure of urchin patches. While
   doing the interviews for the natural system model, we developed a fine
   scale alternative to the usual theoretical explanation of overfishing.
   The scale of management in the fishery occurs at a much broader scale
   than the demographically relevant scale of urchin patches. This results
   in a mismatch of ecological and management scales that leave each patch
   in the fishery in an open access state, resulting in a very fine scale
   form of serial overfishing that removes, piece-by-piece, discrete, local
   aggregations of sea urchins. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Landscape-level conservation that maintains biodiversity and livelihoods
   for local people requires long-term collaborations across local
   communities, scientists, practitioners and decision-makers. The Network
   for Conserving Central India (NCCI) provides a platform for such
   collaborations in a globally important tiger conservation region within
   a complex social-ecological system. Using the NCCI as an example, our
   study identifies indicators to track progress in collaborative
   landscape-level networks across four dimensions: the composition of the
   network; collaborative scientific output; dissemination of research
   outputs through social, electronic and print media; and participation in
   policy and decision-making bodies. The NCCI is primarily comprised of
   members of the scientific community, Non-Governmental Organizations
   (NGOs) and various levels of government. Since 2013, the NCCI members
   conducted research that predominantly addressed human-wildlife conflicts
   and human livelihood needs around protected areas (PAs), with less
   attention to forest ecology and climate. NGOs within the NCCI work
   closely with local communities and provide avenues for local engagement.
   Co-production of policies is an essential but challenging goal due to
   established hierarchies and top-down institutional structures. Our
   analyses highlight the NCCI's role as a knowledge platform and bridge
   among researchers, NGOs, and government, with significant opportunities
   for boundary work in the Science, Policy and Practice Interface (SPPI).
   A challenging and unfulfilled goal is the engagement of local
   communities to co-produce approaches that balance conservation, local
   livelihoods, and development. We suggest that other landscape-level
   networks in social-ecological systems can modify these dimensions as
   pertinent to their respective circumstances to track progress towards
   co-produced management to address livelihood and conservation needs.},

Title = {Adaptation in fire-prone landscapes: interactions of policies,
   management, wildfire, and social networks in Oregon, USA},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {This editorial introduces the special feature on the social-ecological
   system of a fire-prone forest landscape in Oregon, USA. Research into
   social-ecological systems of fire-frequent landscapes is in its infancy
   and this special feature highlights one of the first attempts to
   understand a fire-dependent forest landscape from this perspective. An
   agent-based landscape modeling framework, Envision, was the primary tool
   for the research. The papers in this special feature examine three major
   questions: (1) What is the landscape structure of forest conditions,
   fire regimes, ownerships, and attitudes toward fire and forest
   management?; (2) How are social networks of the study region structured
   and how might they influence attitudes and actions of landowners?; (3)
   How do land management policies, institutions, and decisions interact to
   influence future fire occurrence, biodiversity, and ecosystem services?
   The findings of the empirical research and simulation modeling reveal
   how the high ecological and social (e.g., landownership and management
   goals) diversity of the region contributes to very different fire
   potentials, attitudes, and management approaches across space. The
   social network analysis reveals that the social network is divided into
   fire protection and fire restoration subnetworks that only a few
   organizations were able to bridge. The simulation modeling shows how
   difficult it can be to affect fire behavior across large areas, and what
   the trade-offs of different management actions might be in terms of
   ecosystem services and fire risk. The special feature also includes
   papers that examine how social science research is influenced by the use
   of an agent-based model, and what has been learned about the process of
   conducting social-ecological research and engaging with stakeholders
   with the goal of improving understanding of and adaptation to
   fire-frequent landscapes.},

Title = {Sustainability in forest management and a new role for resilience
   thinking},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {310},
Pages = {416-427},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Forest management faces a substantial challenge with ever-more-pervasive
   anthropogenic impacts and growing demands on forests coupled with the
   increasing certainty of global change. If the capacity of forests to
   provide valued ecological goods and services in the future is to be
   maintained, new tools and approaches will be needed. Several approaches
   have been influential in dealing with sustainability challenges in
   forest management and forestry to date, two of the most notable being
   the ecosystem approach and adaptive management. Resilience-based
   approaches have now emerged as a new paradigm to deal with these
   challenges. This paper considers how resilience thinking might inform
   forest management by exploring its conceptual basis in comparison with
   the ecosystem approach and adaptive management as two earlier
   influences. We identify three novel conceptual contributions and outline
   some of the key challenges encountered when applying resilience thinking
   to the management of forests.
   Resilience thinking offers new conceptual contributions for dealing with
   large and uncertain changes, the relationships between social and
   ecological components of forest systems, and a new perspective on
   sustainability. However, there are several barriers to it informing
   forest management in a practical way, including means by which
   resilience can be measured and valued within a management context, and
   most importantly, how resilience can be maintained and enhanced within
   systems focused on resource production or service provision. Resilience
   thinking's contributions are largely conceptual at this stage and offer
   more in terms a problem-framing approach than analytical or practical
   tools. Decision-relevant, science-based, and solution-oriented
   approaches are required to tackle future forest management challenges.
   Resilience thinking, if developed to become more solution-orientated
   could offer a needed complement to current management paradigms. (C)

Abstract = {People and nature interact since millennia in forests worldwide, but
   current management strategies addressing these ecosystems often exclude
   local people from the decision-making process. This top-down approach is
   the cornerstone of conservation initiatives, particularly in highly
   threatened and fragmented forested ecosystems. In contrast,
   collaborative management involving the participation of local
   com-munities has increasingly contributed to conservation efforts
   globally. Here we ask how collaborative management would contribute to
   the conservation of a threatened, culturally important, and keystone
   tree species. We address this question in the Araucaria Forest System1
   (AFS) in southern Brazil, where the main conservation strategy has been
   top-down based on restrictive use. Throughout the entire distribu-tion
   of AFS, we interviewed 97 smallholders about how they use and manage
   Araucaria angustifolia trees (araucaria). We integrated their
   Traditional Ecological Knowledge2 (TEK) with a literature review about
   the conservation status of Araucaria Forests to analyze potential
   outcomes of two alternative conservation models: top-down with
   restrictive use, and bottom-up with collaborative management. We
   identified the feedback mechanisms in each model, and how they dampen or
   self-reinforced critical processes for AFS resilience. Our models showed
   that a top-down strategy maintains forest cover resilient to illegal
   logging but at the cost of losing TEK (undermining socio-ecological
   resilience) and forest resilience to other external disturbances, such
   as climate change. Alternatively, a bottom-up approach based on
   successful collaborative management schemes may increase the general
   resilience of AFS, while preserving TEK, thus contributing to
   maintaining the entire social-ecological system. Our findings indicate
   how it is paramount to maintain TEK to conserve AFS in the long term
   through collaborative management. By including local actors in the
   governance of AFS, its resilience is reinforced, promoting forest
   expansion, maintenance of TEK, and participatory conservation.},

Title = {Connecting changes in Euphrates River flow to hydropattern of the
   Western Mesopotamian Marshes},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {768},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {The Mesopotamian Marshlands are the largest wetland system in the Middle
   East. Historically, these marshes served as the floodplains of the
   Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and they are currently connected to these
   rivers via surface water feeder canals. Historically, the Mesopotamian
   marshes received consistent flood pulses during the spring season from
   March to May. In recent decades, however, several large dams have been
   constructed in the Tigris and Euphrates basins for irrigation purposes
   and power generation, severely altering the flow regime. which along
   with other direct anthropogenic activities, has severely degraded the
   marsh ecosystem. This work quantifies changes in the riverine flow
   regime and how they have affected the hydro-pattern of the western
   Mesopotamian marshes (focusing on the western Al-Hammar marsh) and
   describes the role of hydrological drivers that are important for marsh
   restoration. The total area of the Al-Hammar marshes has been reduced
   from an average of 2800 km(2) before 1970 to a minimum of 240 km(2) in
   recent decades, concomitant with reductions in annual average Euphrates
   River flow (at Hit) from 967 to 602 m(3)/s and marked flow regime
   alteration. While climate warming and reduced precipitation were
   observed in the basin, changes in the fundamental precipitation-flow
   relationship implicate infrastructural changes (upstream dams) as the
   primary reason for these changes. This analysis quantified how flow
   variability under historic and contemporary conditions have affected
   wetland area and other hydro-pattern characteristics and suggests that
   at an annual average of least 70 m(3)/s of water deliveries to the
   western Mesopotamian marsh are required to restore 1000 km(2) of wetland
   area. Our hope is that this focus on the river-marsh connection will
   help inform predictive models and scenario analysis for restoration of
   this unique social-ecological system. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Lattice-work corridors for climate change: a conceptual framework for
   biodiversity conservation and social-ecological resilience in a tropical
   elevational gradient},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Rapid climate change poses complex challenges for conservation,
   especially in tropical developing countries where biodiversity is high
   while financial and technical resources are limited. The complexity is
   heightened by uncertainty in predicted effects, both for ecological
   systems and human communities that depend heavily on natural resource
   extraction and use. Effective conservation plans and measures must be
   inexpensive, fast-acting, and able to increase the resilience of both
   the ecosystem and the social-ecological system. We present conservation
   practitioners with a framework that strategically integrates climate
   change planning into connectivity measures for tropical mountain
   ecosystems in Costa Rica. We propose a strategy for doubling the amount
   of habitat currently protected in riparian corridors using measures that
   are relatively low cost and fast-acting, and will employ and expand
   human capital. We argue that habitat connectivity must be enhanced along
   latitudinal gradients, but also within the same elevational bands, via a
   lattice-work corridor system. This is needed to facilitate range shifts
   for mobile species and evolutionary adaptation for less mobile species.
   We think that conservation measures within the elevational bands must
   include conservation-friendly land uses that improve current and future
   human livelihoods under dynamic conditions. Key components include
   community involvement, habitat priority-setting, forest landscape
   restoration, and environmental services payments. Our approach is
   fundamentally adaptive in that the conservation measures employed are
   informed by on-the-ground successes and failures and modified
   accordingly, but are relatively low risk and fast-acting. Our proposal,
   if implemented, would satisfy tenets of climate-smart conservation,
   improve the resilience of human and ecological communities, and be a
   model for other locations facing similar challenges.},

Title = {Adapting production forests in southern Sweden to climate change
   Constraints and opportunities for risk spreading},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Pages = {84-97},
Abstract = {Purpose - Recent climate scenarios indicate that Sweden's southern
   region, Gotaland, will experience significant climate change over the
   coming century. Swedish forestry policy guidelines emphasize the need
   for risk spreading to reduce the potential adverse impacts of these
   changes. Risk spreading is defined here as reducing the vulnerability of
   a social-ecological system by increasing the heterogeneity of its
   ecological components. Risk spreading may be achieved through the
   diversification of tree species currently relied upon by the forestry
   sector. The purpose of this paper is to consider the capacity of the
   socio-ecological forest system to adapt to climate change through the
   use of risk spreading.
   Design/methodology/approach - A variety of disciplines contribute to the
   understanding of the rate at which risk spreading is likely to take
   place in a system. A synthesis is conducted to unite these insights.
   Findings - Five key constraints on the rate at which risk spreading can
   take place are identified. These include constraints imposed by the
   silvicultural system itself, voluntary policy measures, forest-owner
   perceptions of climate change, motivation among forest owners to respond
   to risk, and forestry consultants. Potential future directions are
   discussed and include the need for specifying the goal of risk spreading
   policy, and the need to evaluate the motivations of those forest owners
   already altering adopting risk spreading approaches.
   Originality/value - Conceptual equivalents of the ``risk spreading{''}
   approach are international, due to the need for many societies to adapt
   social-ecological systems to climate change. The issues raised from this
   case study/synthesis provide value insights regarding the breadth of
   systemic constraints which can thwart attempts at rapid adjustment to
   climate change, and where solutions to these constraints may be found.},

Abstract = {Analysis of social-ecological systems is becoming increasingly used
   since the framework provides a valuable set of variables for
   understanding relationships between people and ecosystems. This
   interaction focuses on the use and management of natural resources that,
   in many cases, are common-pool resources. In Mexico, common-pool
   resources have long been explored since at least 60\% of the forested
   lands in the country are held under the legal figure of `ejidos' and
   indigenous communities, which aimed at driving the collective use of
   lands and resources. However, few studies incorporate ecological
   processes for an integrated understanding of social-ecological systems.
   In this study, we seek to understand how ecological variability
   influences the creation and functioning of different rules and,
   consequently, institutions for forests management. Our case study was
   conducted in an ejido with high ecological variability located in
   Jalisco on the Pacific coast of Mexico. The research approach was
   interdisciplinary and combined qualitative and quantitative methods. We
   conducted participant observation and 23 semi-structured interviews;
   botanical collections were also carried out. We found that there is
   strong influence between ecological variables and the emergence of rules
   and collective action. The most important variables influencing these
   processes were the economic value of resource units, ecosystem services
   perceived by local people and location and size of the resource system
   (including area and number of species). Historical processes also play a
   part that generates knowledge of resource systems and the current
   social, economic and political settings at a larger scale. The
   establishment of relationships with variables that produce certain
   outcomes for the framework of the social-ecological system is an
   important challenge to be met in order to move forward in both theory
   and practice.},

Abstract = {Recreation ecology has its foundations in the premise that
   recreationists have a negative impact on ecosystems, and are thus
   treated as an ecological stressor. However, ecology is the study of
   interactions between organisms and the environment, not just an
   organism's impacts on the environment. While we do not dispute the
   evidence that recreationists can negatively impact ecosystems,
   recreation can also have positive effects for conservation.
   Contextualizing interactions between recreation and ecology within
   broader multi-scale social-ecological systems can advance our scientific
   knowledge of these interactions to provide a basis for more effective
   management of protected areas that host recreation. In this paper, we
   propose the concept that recreation-ecosystem interactions are part of a
   system with a range of positive, negative, and neutral interactions with
   feedbacks of variable intensity occurring between multiple levels. We
   simplify this concept into a two-dimensional quadrant system to describe
   the spectrum of interactions within a range of social-ecological
   systems, which could be developed for countless natural and social
   systems. For example, the social portion of this system includes values
   such as cultural, health and well-being, tribal, and many others;
   examples of the ecological portion include vegetation, biodiversity,
   soils, and more. As an illustrative example, we develop the system for
   recreation-wildlife interactions. We also emphasize the importance of
   integrating recreation and wildlife research and management through
   approaches based on this framework. Future research in this area might
   be improved by considering this novel framework to balance the needs of
   humans and protect natural ecosystems in protected area management
   decisions.Management implications: The framework aims to help outdoor
   recreation managers and researchers better-Address existing gaps in
   research and management,-Collaborate with those working in complementary
   fields ,-Develop more integrative recreation planning and management
   tools, and-Resolve persistent problems in outdoor recreation management.},

Title = {A review of urban forest modeling: Implications for management and
   future research},
Journal = {URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {43},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Urban forest modeling is becoming increasingly complex, global, and
   transdisciplinary. Increased modeling of urban forest structure and
   function presents an urgent need for comparative studies to assess the
   similarities and differences between modeling techniques and
   applications. This paper provides a systematic review of 242 journal
   papers over the past two-decades, and identifies 476 case studies. We
   assess model case studies among different locations, units and scales,
   compare the ability and functional capacity of the models and different
   tools, compare papers published in different disciplines, and identify
   new emerging topics in the field of urban forest modeling. Conclusions
   from this analysis include: (1) the spatial distribution of case studies
   is primarily clustered around the US, Europe, and China, with the most
   popular units to model being streets and parks; (2) the most commonly
   used model types are the i-Tree toolset, ENVI-met computational fluid
   dynamic models, and the Hedonic price model; (3) uncertainty assessment
   of urban forest models is limited; (4) spatially explicit models are
   critically important for estimating of ecosystem services as well as for
   environment management; (5) most case studies focus on biophysical
   benefits with few studies estimating economic and social benefits; and
   (6) linkages between urban forests and their social-psychological and
   health effects are less common due to subjectivity and uncertainty in
   expressing and quantifying human cultures, attitudes and behaviors.
   Based on a comparison of different models and a syntheses of case
   studies, we make suggestions for future research connecting urban
   forestry and urban ecosystems, model development, and ecosystem
   services. Such knowledge is critical for policy- and decision-makers,
   and can help improve urban forest planning, design and management.},

Title = {Feeding sites promoting wildlife-related tourism might highly expose the
   endangered Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (<i>Rhinopithecus bieti</i>) to
   parasite transmission},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {An increasing number of studies have found that the implementation of
   feeding sites for wildlife-related tourism can affect animal health,
   behaviour and reproduction. Feeding sites can favour high densities,
   home range overlap, greater sedentary behaviour and increased
   interspecific contacts, all of which might promote parasite
   transmission. In the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti),
   human interventions via provisioning monkeys at specific feeding sites
   have led to the sub-structuring of a group into genetically
   differentiated sub-groups. The fed subgroup is located near human
   hamlets and interacts with domesticated animals. Using high-throughput
   sequencing, we investigated Entamoeba species diversity in a local host
   assemblage strongly influenced by provisioning for wildlife-related
   tourism. We identified 13 Entamoeba species or lineages in faeces of
   Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys, humans and domesticated animals (including
   pigs, cattle, and domestic chicken). In Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys,
   Entamoeba prevalence and OTU richness were higher in the fed than in the
   wild subgroup. Entamoeba polecki was found in monkeys, pigs and humans,
   suggesting that this parasite might circulates between the wild and
   domestic components of this local social-ecological system. The highest
   proportion of faeces positive for Entamoeba in monkeys geographically
   coincided with the presence of livestock and humans. These elements
   suggest that feeding sites might indirectly play a role on parasite
   transmission in the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey. The implementation of such
   sites should carefully consider the risk of creating hotspots of disease
   transmission, which should be prevented by maintaining a buffer zone
   between monkeys and livestock/humans. Regular screenings for pathogens
   in fed subgroup are necessary to monitor transmission risk in order to
   balance the economic development of human communities dependent on
   wildlife-related tourism, and the conservation of the endangered Yunnan
   snub-nosed monkey.},

Title = {Environmental determinants of the old oaks in wood-pastures from a

Abstract = {Large, old trees are keystone ecological structures, their decline
   having disproportional ecological consequences. There is virtually no
   information available regarding the status and occurrence of old trees
   in traditional cultural landscapes from Eastern Europe. In this study,
   we explore the environmental determinants of the old oaks found in
   wood-pastures from a changing traditional rural landscape from Central
   Romania. Both the old oaks and the wood-pastures harboring them have
   exceptional cultural, historical, and ecological values, yet are
   vulnerable to land-use change. We surveyed 41 wood-pastures from
   Southern Transylvania and counted the old oaks in them. We then related
   the number of old oaks from these wood-pastures to a set of local and
   landscape level variables related to wood-pastures. We found 490 old
   oaks in 25 wood-pastures. The number of old oaks was positively related
   to the size of the wood-pasture and the amount of pasture and forest
   around it (500 m buffer), and negatively related to the proximity of the
   village. Furthermore, we found a significant interaction between the
   effects of sheepfolds in the wood-pasture and the size of the
   wood-pasture on the number of old trees, indicating a negative influence
   of sheepfolds on the number of old trees in smaller sized wood-pastures.
   There is an increasing risk for losing old trees in the traditional
   cultural landscapes due to the lack of formal recognition of these
   trees. Therefore, while presenting the positive example of local
   initiatives and citizen science, we argue for an urgent development and
   implementation of conservation policies along with education strategies
   targeting the old trees and rural communities from the changing
   traditional cultural landscapes of Eastern Europe.},

Title = {Tourism at Costalegre, Mexico: An ecosystem services-based exploration
   of current challenges and alternative futures},
Journal = {FUTURES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {66},
Pages = {70-84},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Tourism, as all human activities, is dependent on the natural
   environment and its respective ecosystem services (ES). Different user
   groups manage and consume these touristic ES differently, resulting in
   discrepancies and potential conflicts. Despite the urgency to find
   inclusive local approaches for sustainable development, tourism studies
   still analyze socio-economic and ecological impacts separately and lack
   integrated social-ecological approaches to improve foresight in tourism
   planning. Based on a growing concern regarding the future of Costalegre
   on the Jalisco coast of Western Mexico, we analyze through interviews,
   surveys, and participant observation the dependence of tourism on
   specific ecosystem services and conduct a scenario analysis which shows
   present and future implications for the social-ecological system.
   Furthermore, this analysis shows in detail how different scenarios
   change ES provision and people's livelihoods. Key findings include
   identifying freshwater provision and cultural ES as the most important
   touristic ES. At a regional scale, peasants in ejidos are the main ES
   stewards, whereas high-class tourism facilities constitute important
   local stewards. Benefits, mainly access to freshwater and the beach, are
   unequally distributed, provoking conflicts among different ES user
   groups that may escalate in the near future. Improved communication
   between all user groups and strengthening of key political actors seem
   to be the most immediate recommendations to ensure the long term
   sustainability of this particular region. This work may contribute to
   improved planning and decision-making as our ES based scenarios are a
   first step to integrate social-ecological knowledge into improved
   decision-making. At a local scale, the study reveals the most likely
   future development options and their social and ecological consequences.
   It could also serve as a baseline for informed policy making. (C) 2014

Year = {2009},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {The landscape of Mengsong, southwest China, was biologically diverse
   until recently due to historical biogeographical processes overlain by
   the swidden-cultivation practices of the Hani who migrated there several
   centuries ago. Our research sought to understand how the Hani adjusted
   their livelihoods to new policies, markets, and technologies, and the
   consequences for biodiversity conservation. We combined landscape, plot,
   and household surveys, interviews, and reviews of secondary documents,
   to reconstruct the major changes and responses to challenges in the
   social-ecological system over previous decades. Significant changes from
   closed to open canopy of secondary-forest vegetation took place between
   1965-1993 and from open-canopy to closed-canopy forest between
   1993-2006, mostly explainable by changes in state land-use policies and
   the market economy. Most remaining swidden-fallow succession had been
   converted into tea or rubber plantations. Swidden-fallow fields used to
   contain significant levels of biological diversity. Until 2000,
   biodiversity served several important ecological and social functions in
   the Hani livelihood system. Indigenous institutions were often
   functional, for example, linked to fire control, soil management, and
   watershed protection. For centuries, the Hani had detailed knowledge of
   the landscape, helping them to adjust rapidly to ecological disturbances
   and changes in production demands. The Hani understood succession
   processes that enabled them to carry out long-term land-management
   strategies. Recent government policies and market dynamics have
   simplified livelihoods and landscapes, seriously reducing biodiversity,
   but greatly increasing the area of closed-canopy forest (including
   plantations) and undermining the usefulness of Hani knowledge and
   land-use institutions. Meeting both conservation and development
   objectives in this landscape will require new functional links between
   sustainable livelihoods, culture, and biodiversity, rather than seeking
   to recreate the past.},

Title = {The Monteregie Connection: linking landscapes, biodiversity, and
   ecosystem services to improve decision making},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {To maximize specific ecosystem services (ES) such as food production,
   people alter landscape structure, i.e., the types of ecosystems present,
   their relative proportions, and their spatial arrangement across
   landscapes. This can have significant, and sometimes unexpected, effects
   on biodiversity and ES. Communities need information about how land/use
   activities and changes to landscape structure are likely to affect
   biodiversity and ES, but current scientific understanding of these
   effects is incomplete. The Monteregie Connection (MC) project has used
   the rapidly suburbanizing agricultural Monteregien landscape just east
   of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to investigate how current and historic
   landscape structure influences ES provision. Our results highlight the
   importance of forest connectivity and functional diversity on ES
   provision, and show that ES provision can vary significantly even within
   single land-use types in response to changes in landscape structure. Our
   historical analysis reveals that levels of ES provision, as well as
   relationships among individual ES, can change dramatically through time.
   We are using these results to build quantitative ES-landscape structure
   models to assess four future landscape scenarios for the region:
   Periurban Development, Demand for Energy, Whole-System Crisis, and Green
   Development. These scenarios integrate empirical and historical data on
   ES provision with local stakeholder input about global and local social
   and ecological drivers to explore how land-use decisions could affect ES
   provision and human well-being across the region to the year 2045. By
   integrating empirical data, quantitative models, and scenarios we have
   achieved the central goals of the MC project: (1) increasing
   understanding of the effects of landscape structure on biodiversity and
   ES provision, (2) effectively linking this knowledge to decision making
   to better manage for biodiversity and ES, and (3) creating a vision for
   a more sustainable social-ecological system in the region.},

   analysis of system change and opportunities},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {81},
Pages = {346-359},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Land use change arises from a variety of socio-economic and/or
   biophysical drivers, with direct and/or indirect feedbacks on the
   long-term functionality of the land as the fundamental life-support
   system for human wellbeing. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of
   production systems is critical for decision-making to maintain both
   functioning ecosystems and land-dependent livelihoods. We applied the
   adaptive cycle metaphor to examine historic spatiotemporal changes in
   one of the largest communal regions (ejido) in the Northern most
   extension of the tropical forest biome in Mexico. This large-scale case
   study explores the effects of a series of exogenous and endogenous
   drivers that transformed a former dense tropical forest into an
   intensive industrial sugarcane plantation with parallel developments and
   adjustments of rural livelihoods. We demonstrate how integral knowledge
   on the historical development of a 70-year old social-ecological system
   (SES) helps build fundamental understanding of the vulnerability,
   resilience, and adaptability of land and people (livelihoods) to current
   diverse external and endogenous drivers. With the adaptive cycle
   metaphor, we identified stable system states and the current phase of
   our focal SES, which, before the 1940s, was covered by dense dry
   tropical forest. The current SES had passed all phases in the adaptive
   cycle more than once and is presently in the early conservation phase
   represented by a high input commercial sugarcane production system with
   reduced resilience to external drivers of change. We show which drivers
   and historical events best explained the regional socioecological system
   dynamics including its vulnerability, resilience, and adaptability
   considering certain system states. Understanding system dynamics and
   phase changes considering the adaptive cycle metaphor helps identify
   both social and ecological resilience characteristics, and unexplored
   windows of opportunity for guided transformation of system states out of
   social-ecological traps.},

Abstract = {The path for bringing millions of people out of poverty in Africa is
   likely to coincide with important changes in land use and land cover
   (LULC). Envisioning the different possible pathways for agricultural,
   economic and social development, and their implications for changes in
   LULC, ecosystem services and society well-being, will improve
   policy-making. This paper presents a case that uses a multi-scale
   participatory scenario planning method to facilitate the understanding
   of the complex interactions between LULC change and the wellbeing of the
   rural population and their possible future evolution in Mozambique up to
   2035. Key drivers of change were identified: the empowerment of civil
   society, the effective application of legislation and changes in rural
   technologies (e.g., information and communications technologies and
   renewable energy sources). Three scenarios were constructed: one
   characterized by the government promoting large investments; a second
   scenario characterized by the increase in local community power and
   public policies to promote small and medium enterprises; and a third,
   intermediate scenario. All three scenarios highlight qualitative large
   LULC changes, either driven by large companies or by small and medium
   scale farmers. The scenarios have different impact in wellbeing and
   equity, the first one implying a higher rural to urban area migration.
   The results also show that the effective application of the law can
   produce different results, from assuring large international investments
   to assuring the improvement of social services like education, health
   care and extension services. Successful application of these policies,
   both for biodiversity and ecosystem services protection, and for the
   social services needed to improve the well-being of the Mozambican rural
   population, will have to overcome significant barriers.},

Booktitle = {PARTICIPATORY MANGROVE MANAGEMENT IN A CHANGING CLIMATE: PERSPECTIVES
   FROM THE ASIA-PACIFIC},
Series = {Disaster Risk Reduction},
Year = {2017},
Pages = {137-160},
Abstract = {The short- and long-term impacts from natural hazards, which are thought
   to be the consequences of climate change, interrupt the functions of the
   social-ecological system of the Sundarbans Mangrove Forest (SMF) in
   Bangladesh, which in turn affect the livelihood of people at risk. In
   the absence of sustainable livelihood options, over time these people
   have become more dependent on the resources of the Sundarbans. This
   study investigates how their livelihood strategies affect the dependency
   pattern on the common resources of this mangrove forest during economic
   depressions that resulted from disasters caused by extreme climatic
   events. The focus of this investigation is on a sub-district known as
   Koyra, located in southwestern coastal Bangladesh, which has the longest
   border with the Sundarbans. Relevant parameters such as climatic trends
   and extreme events, financial-physical-structural damage patterns,
   socioeconomic peculiarities, changes in consumption expenditure, asset
   portfolio, and occupation patterns are considered. Data are collected
   from 420 households through face-to-face questionnaires and seven focus
   group discussions (FGDs). The empirical results suggest that the higher
   intensity and frequency of natural hazards have led to substantially
   higher damages of asset and capital goods. Over the last two decades,
   around 8 \% of the sampled households have become landless; more than 25
   \% have switched from crops to other nonagricultural occupations; and
   more than 26 \% have started depending on forest resources for their
   consumption smoothing. In addition, each household has incurred annual
   disaster damages of on average US\$ 177. Combined with the absence of
   well-defined property rights, the people at risk have become more
   dependent on resources from the SMF for their livelihoods as well as
   consumption smoothing, which eventually is likely to jeopardize the
   stock of renewable resources of this forest. We recommend redefining
   property rights to ensure a win-win platform for all the stakeholders.},

   urban forest characteristics are often limited to contemporary
   socioeconomic factors, overlooking the role of history. The
   institutions, human communities, and biophysical conditions of cities
   change over time, creating layers of legacies on the landscape, shifting
   urban forests through complex interactive processes and feedbacks. Urban
   green spaces and planted trees can persist long after their
   establishment, meaning that today's mature canopy reflects conditions
   and decisions from many years prior. In this synthesis article, we
   discuss some of the major historical human and biophysical drivers and
   associated legacy effects expressed in present urban forest patterns,
   highlighting examples in the United States and Canada. The bioregional
   context - native biome, climate, topography, initial vegetation, and
   pre-urbanization land use - represents the initial conditions in which a
   city established and grew, and this context influences how legacy
   effects unfold. Human drivers of legacy effects can reflect specific
   historical periods: colonial histories related to the symbolism of
   certain species, and the urban parks and civic beautification movements.
   Other human drivers include phenomena that cut across time periods such
   as neighborhood urban form and socioeconomic change. Biophysical legacy
   effects include the consequences of past disturbances such as extreme
   weather events and pest and disease outbreaks. Urban tree professionals
   play a major role in many legacy effects by mediating the interactions
   and feedbacks between biophysical and human drivers. We emphasize the
   importance of historical perspectives to understand past drivers that
   have produced current urban forest patterns, and call for
   interdisciplinary and mixed methods research to unpack the mechanisms of
   long-term urban forest change at intra- and inter-city scales.},

Title = {An intergenerational transmission of sustainability? Ancestral habitus

Abstract = {The need for sustainable alternatives to industrial farming has led to a
   revival of interest in traditional agro-ecosystems. Whilst it is well
   recognised that traditional agro-ecosystems are both social and
   physical-technical - few case studies have examined interactions between
   both these dimensions in a single system. For a system to be considered
   sustainable it needs to be shown to have retained key characteristics
   over several generations. Case studies therefore demand a location where
   intergenerational transmission of agro-ecological knowledge and practice
   is ongoing. This paper examines the intergenerational transmission of
   social and physical-technical dimensions of a traditional agroecosystem
   of the Loma people in NW Liberia. We engage an innovative
   interdisciplinary combination of methodologies in analyzing interactions
   between: (i) energy efficiencies (yield to labour) in 3 different Loma
   food production systems, using longitudinal quantitative surveys, and,
   (ii) the social institutions that mediate food production practice,
   using qualitative methods. Our energy efficiency calculations show that
   AIDE cultivation is more than twice as efficient at producing calories
   as either shifting cultivation or forest and river extractivism, yet GPS
   mapping demonstrates that AIDE cultivation is highly spatially
   restricted despite clear opportunities for expansion and optimisation.
   This raises an important question: why have the Loma not expanded AIDE
   cultivation? We propose that despite being fully aware of the
   opportunities AfDEs present, a Loma `ancestral habitus' and substantive
   economic rationality restrict areal expansion and optimisation of AIDE
   cultivation, curtailing growth and structuring a social-ecological
   system in dynamic equilibrium. Our findings underline that
   sustainability is not simply a physio-technical issue; social and belief
   issues appear to be far more important in framing behaviour in
   traditional agro-ecosystems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Maintaining natural and traditional cultural green infrastructures
   across Europe: learning from historic and current landscape
   transformations},
Journal = {LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {36},

Pages = {637-663},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Context Maintaining functional green infrastructures (GIs) require
   evidence-based knowledge about historic and current states and trends of
   representative land cover types. Objectives We address: (1) the
   long-term loss and transformation of potential natural forest
   vegetation; (2) the effects of site productivity on permanent forest
   loss and emergence of traditional cultural landscapes; (3) the current
   management intensity; and (4) the social-ecological contexts conducive
   to GI maintenance . Methods We selected 16 case study regions, each with
   a local hotspot landscape, ranging from intact forest landscapes, via
   contiguous and fragmented forest covers, to severe forest loss.
   Quantitative open access data were used to estimate (i) the historic
   change and (ii) transformation of land covers, and (iii) compare the
   forest canopy loss from 2000 to 2018. Qualitative narratives about each
   hotspot landscape were analysed for similarities (iv). Results While the
   potential natural forest vegetation cover in the 16 case study regions
   had a mean of 86\%, historically it has been reduced to 34\%. Higher
   site productivity coincided with transformation to non-forest land
   covers. The mean annual forest canopy loss for 2000-2018 ranged from
   0.01 to 1.08\%. The 16 case studies represented five distinct
   social-ecological contexts (1) radical transformation of landscapes, (2)
   abuse of protected area concepts, (3) ancient cultural landscapes (4)
   multi-functional forests, and (5) intensive even-aged forest management,
   of which 1 and 4 was most common. Conclusions GIs encompass both forest
   naturalness and traditional cultural landscapes. Our review of
   Pan-European regions and landscapes revealed similarities in seemingly
   different contexts, which can support knowledge production and learning
   about how to sustain GIs.},

Title = {Participatory modelling for conceptualizing social-ecological system
   dynamics in the Bangladesh delta},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {The concept of complex social-ecological systems (SES) as a means for
   capturing system dynamics properties (e.g. interactions and feedbacks)
   has gained attention in policymaking and advancing evidence in
   understanding complex systems. In contexts with limited data, conceptual
   system dynamic models offer a promising entry point to overcome
   challenges in understanding SES dynamics, which is essential for
   managing the long-term sustainability of SES and human wellbeing. Here,
   we build on previous work focused on agricultural production and use
   participatory approaches to develop a conceptual System Dynamics (SD)
   model for the south-west coastal SES in Bangladesh encompassing multiple
   forms of livelihood (fisheries, shrimp farming and forests, as well as
   agriculture). Using qualitative methods, including focus group
   discussions with farmers, fishermen, shrimp farmers and forest people,
   as well as expert consultations, we identified interactions, feedback
   loops and thresholds for the SES. The conceptual system model developed
   independently by stakeholders is consistent with a model developed using
   an empirical approach and literature review. Feedback loops are
   identified for the ecological (e.g. climate and water, mangrove and
   salinity) and social (e.g. shrimp farming and mangrove, agricultural
   (e.g. crops) production and subsidy) sub-systems in the Bangladesh
   delta. The biophysical thresholds that impact social conditions include
   river water discharge (1500 to 2000 m(3) s(-1)), climate (28 degrees C)
   and soil salinity (similar to 4 to similar to 10 dS m(-1)). Exceeding
   these thresholds suggests that SES may lose resilience in the near
   future and increase the likelihood of regime shifts. Findings of this
   study contribute to the management of the deltaic ecosystem and provide
   specific policy recommendations for improving environmental
   sustainability and human well-being in the Bangladesh delta and can be
   further used as inputs into system dynamic modelling to simulate changes

Title = {Landscapes Toolkit: an integrated modelling framework to assist

Abstract = {At present, stakeholders wishing to develop land use and management
   change scenarios at the landscape scale and to assess their
   corresponding impacts on water quality, biodiversity and economic
   performance, must examine the output of a suite of separate models. The
   process is not simple and presents a considerable deterrent to making
   such comparisons and impedes the development of more sustainable,
   multifunctional landscapes. To remedy this problem, we developed the
   Landscapes Toolkit, an integrated modelling framework that assists
   natural resource managers, policy-makers, planners and local communities
   explore options for sustainable landscape development. The Landscapes
   Toolkit links spatially-explicit disciplinary models, to enable
   integrated assessment of the water quality, biodiversity and economic
   outcomes of stakeholder-defined land use and management change
   scenarios. We use the Tully-Murray catchment in the Great Barrier Reef
   region of Australia as a case study to illustrate the development and
   application of the Landscapes Toolkit. Results show that the Landscapes
   Toolkit strikes a satisfactory balance between the inclusion of
   component models that sufficiently capture the richness of some key
   aspects of social-ecological system processes and the need for
   stakeholders to understand and compare the results of the different
   models. The latter is a prerequisite to making more informed decisions
   about sustainable landscape development. The flexibility of being able
   to add additional models and to update existing models is a particular
   strength of the Landscapes Toolkit design. Hence, the Landscapes Toolkit
   offers a promising modelling framework for supporting social learning
   and adaptive management through participatory scenario development and
   evaluation as well as being a tool to guide planning and policy
   discussions at the landscape scale.},

Title = {Anticipating future risk in social-ecological systems using fuzzy
   cognitive mapping: the case of wildfire in the Chiquitania, Bolivia},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Understanding complex social-ecological systems, and anticipating how
   they may respond to rapid change, requires an approach that incorporates
   environmental, social, economic, and policy factors, usually in a
   context of fragmented data availability. We employed fuzzy cognitive
   mapping (FCM) to integrate these factors in the assessment of future
   wildfire risk in the Chiquitania region, Bolivia. In this region,
   dealing with wildfires is becoming increasingly challenging because of
   reinforcing feedbacks between multiple drivers. We conducted
   semistructured interviews and constructed different FCMs in focus groups
   to understand the regional dynamics of wildfire from diverse
   perspectives. We used FCM modelling to evaluate possible adaptation
   scenarios in the context of future drier climatic conditions. Scenarios
   also considered possible failure to respond in time to the emergent
   risk. This approach proved of great potential to support decision making
   for risk management. It helped identify key forcing variables and
   generate insights into potential risks and trade-offs of different
   strategies. The ``Hands-off{''} scenario resulted in amplified impacts
   driven by intensifying trends, affecting particularly the agricultural
   production under drought conditions. The ``Fire management{''} scenario,
   which adopted a bottom-up approach to improve controlled burning, showed
   less trade-offs between wildfire risk reduction and production compared
   with the ``Fire suppression{''} scenario. Findings highlighted the
   importance of considering strategies that involve all actors who use
   fire, and the need to nest these strategies for a more systemic approach
   to manage wildfire risk. The FCM model could be used as a
   decision-support tool and serve as a ``boundary object{''} to facilitate
   collaboration and integration of different perceptions of fire in the
   region. This approach also has the potential to inform decisions in
   other dynamic frontier landscapes around the world that are facing
   increased risk of large wildfires.},

Title = {Pau-brasil and string instrument bows telecouple nature, art, and
   heritage},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The wood of the pau-brasil tree (Paubrasilia echinata Lam., formerly
   Caesalpinia echinata Lam.) is used worldwide as raw material for the
   construction of high-quality bows for string instruments. Alternative
   tree species are rarely accepted by professional musicians, or by bow
   and violin makers. Historical overexploitation of this endemic species
   in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome (Mata Atlantica), a global
   biodiversity hotpot including UNESCO World Natural Heritage Sites, and
   illegal trade have caused drastic declines in its natural abundance.
   Pau-brasil is now classified as an endangered species and listed in
   Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
   Species. Traditional bow-making craftsmanship, an intangible cultural
   heritage, depends heavily on the high-quality pau-brasil wood. This
   complex situation presents unprecedented cross-continental
   transdisciplinary challenges. In order to target the protection of this
   coupled natural/cultural heritage, this work frames and examines the
   pau-brasil/bow-making cultural-ecological system as a complex
   telecoupled system linked by cultural ecosystem services provided by the
   pau-brasil, as well as the relationships and cultural exchanges among
   key actors. Using historical trajectory analysis, we identify past,
   present, and potential future trigger events, key drivers, and key
   system variables that explain the dynamics, feedback, and resilience of
   this complex multidimensional system. Furthermore, with a cross-scale
   social and power relations analysis, we examine the level of
   dependencies and influences of contemporary key actors on the ecosystem
   services provided by the pau-brasil and their interconnections, in order
   to ultimately identify their level of disadvantage regarding the
   pau-brasil. Finally, we discuss the potential of this novel
   cultural-ecological system approach to (i) interlink science, nature,
   and art, (ii) reconcile the currently competing protection aims of
   natural and cultural heritage elements, and (iii) provide future
   trajectories regarding the resilience and sustainable development of
   this pau-brasil/bowmaking cultural-ecological system. We advocate for
   this novel path forward toward sustainable transformation of complex
   cultural-ecological systems urgently needed to navigate our increasingly
   telecoupled world.},

Title = {``A shepherd has to invent{''}: Poetic analysis of social-ecological
   change in the cultural landscape of the central Spanish Pyrenees},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Since the mid-20th century, the Pyrenean pastoral social-ecological
   system (SES) has undergone socioeconomic and demographic transformations
   leading to changes in grazing practices and a decline in the livestock
   industry. Land abandonment has contributed to an ecological transition
   from herbaceous vegetation cover to shrublands and forests, leading to a
   loss of ecosystem services, including biodiversity and forage. I
   interviewed 27 stockmen (ganaderos) in two valleys of the central
   Pyrenees to document their traditional ecological knowledge and
   observations of environmental, social, economic, and cultural changes in
   the valleys. I used poetic analysis, a qualitative data analysis
   approach, to illustrate and analyze one ganadero's experience of
   social-ecological change. First, I created seven poems based on an
   interview transcript with this ganadero. Second, I analyzed the poetry I
   created, to see what new insights and understanding about system
   dynamics and the lived experience of SES change emerged from analysis of
   the transcript re-presented as poetry. Third, I compared key themes that
   emerged from this analysis with findings across the other 26 interviews.
   Fourth, I read the poems and presented the associated analysis to
   multiple audiences, to gauge their impact and effectiveness in
   communicating research findings. Finally, I synthesized across the
   themes raised in the seven poems. Poetic analysis revealed emotional and
   cultural dimensions of change, especially the importance of occupational
   and place identity, in the experience of the ganadero. The transcript
   re-presented as poetry portrayed the ganadero as an agent in creating
   and maintaining a cultural landscape and as both an adaptor and resister
   to SES change. Poetic analysis also uncovered telling contradictions,
   adaptive capacities, and barriers to adaptation in this SES that went
   unappreciated with conventional qualitative analysis approaches. This
   exploratory study illustrates the potential of poetry as a method of
   data analysis and communication in SES research.},

Title = {Meeting places and social capital supporting rural landscape
   stewardship: A Pan-European horizon scanning},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Achieving sustainable development as an inclusive societal process in
   rural landscapes, and sustainability in terms of functional green
   infrastructures for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services,
   are wicked challenges. Competing claims from various sectors call for
   evidence-based adaptive collaborative governance. Leveraging such
   approaches requires maintenance of several forms of social interactions
   and capitals. Focusing on Pan-European regions with different
   environmental histories and cultures, we estimate the state and trends
   of two groups of factors underpinning rural landscape stewardship,
   namely, (1) traditional rural landscape and novel face-to-face as well
   as virtual fora for social interaction, and (2) bonding, bridging, and
   linking forms of social capital. We applied horizon scanning to 16 local
   landscapes located in 18 countries, representing Pan-European
   social-ecological and cultural gradients. The resulting narratives, and
   rapid appraisal knowledge, were used to estimate portfolios of different
   fora for social interactions and forms of social capital supporting
   landscape stewardship. The portfolios of fora for social interactions
   were linked to societal cultures across the European continent:
   ``self-expression and secular-rational values{''} in the northwest,
   ``Catholic{''} in the south, and ``survival and traditional authority
   values{''} in the East. This was explained by the role of traditional
   secular and religious local meeting places. Virtual internet-based fora
   were most widespread. Bonding social capitals were the strongest across
   the case study landscapes, and linking social capitals were the weakest.
   This applied to all three groups of fora. Pan-European social-ecological
   contexts can be divided into distinct clusters with respect to the
   portfolios of different fora supporting landscape stewardship, which
   draw mostly on bonding and bridging forms of social capital. This
   emphasizes the need for regionally and culturally adapted approaches to
   landscape stewardship, which are underpinned by evidence-based knowledge
   about how to sustain green infrastructures based on both forest
   naturalness and cultural landscape values. Sharing knowledge from
   comparative studies can strengthen linking social capital.},

Title = {Scale mismatches in social-ecological systems: Causes, consequences, and
   solutions},

Abstract = {Scale is a concept that transcends disciplinary boundaries. In ecology
   and geography, scale is usually defined in terms of spatial and temporal
   dimensions. Sociological scale also incorporates space and time, but
   adds ideas about representation and organization. Although spatial and
   temporal location determine the context for social and ecological
   dynamics, social-ecological interactions can create dynamic feedback
   loops in which humans both influence and are influenced by ecosystem
   processes. We hypothesize that many of the problems encountered by
   societies in managing natural resources arise because of a mismatch
   between the scale of management and the scale(s) of the ecological
   processes being managed. We use examples from southern Africa and the
   southern United States to address four main questions: ( 1) What is a
   ``scale mismatch?{''} ( 2) How are scale mismatches generated? ( 3) What
   are the consequences of scale mismatches? ( 4) How can scale mismatches
   be resolved? Scale mismatches occur when the scale of environmental
   variation and the scale of social organization in which the
   responsibility for management resides are aligned in such a way that one
   or more functions of the social-ecological system are disrupted,
   inefficiencies occur, and/or important components of the system are
   lost. They are generated by a wide range of social, ecological, and
   linked social-ecological processes. Mismatches between the scales of
   ecological processes and the institutions that are responsible for
   managing them can contribute to a decrease in social-ecological
   resilience, including the mismanagement of natural resources and a
   decrease in human well-being. Solutions to scale mismatches usually
   require institutional changes at more than one hierarchical level.
   Long-term solutions to scale mismatch problems will depend on social
   learning and the development of flexible institutions that can adjust
   and reorganize in response to changes in ecosystems. Further research is
   needed to improve our ability to diagnose, understand, and resolve scale
   mismatches in linked social-ecological systems.},

Title = {The social-ecological drivers across land-use intersects driving marula
   tree population dynamics in north-eastern South Africa},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {492},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {A range of social and economic factors impact tree species, such as
   Sclerocarya birrea subsp. caffra (marula), which provide livelihood
   sustenance for local communities in the savanna woodlands of southern
   Africa. As an ecologically important savanna species, valued both
   culturally and economically, it is imperative to understand if resource
   use is sustainable. Population stability can be understood by comparing
   tree density and size-class distribution (SCD) profiles across land-use
   types (homestead yards, fields and rangelands) in non-conservation
   savanna social-ecological systems. Marula tree population data were
   gathered in rangeland transects and randomly selected fields and yards
   from four human settlements in the Bushbuckridge municipality of
   northeastern South Africa. Total density was lowest in fields (mean ? SE
   = 7.4 ? 0.7 trees/ha) and highest in homestead yards (mean ? SE = 25.7 ?
   4.1 trees/ha). Social data revealed that elevated seedling and sapling
   population densities in yards is linked to discarded kernels from marula
   beer making. Total densities increased in yards over a 15-year period
   but declined in rangelands, with female densities remaining almost
   constant across land-use types over this period. This is an important
   finding as it is a strong indication of socially-mediated population
   structure changes, confirming that combined cultural and economic value
   can lead to examples of species conservation. In this case, the
   prioritization of female trees as the distinguished fruit producers. SCD
   revealed weak recruitment in fields and rangelands. Diminished
   regeneration, combined with overharvesting for fuelwood in rangelands
   and felling trees in yards, is likely to negatively impact population
   stability in the longterm. Understanding resource conservation and
   degradation in the context of important non-timber forest products
   (NTFPs) is a key knowledge challenge, with this study serving as an
   updated inventory benchmark for marula populations in the area.
   Important lessons learned here can be applied to other social-ecological
   contexts where a key natural resource is responsible for sustaining
   livelihoods.},

Abstract = {Purpose of ReviewForests support most global terrestrial biodiversity
   and contribute to the livelihood of billions of people, but these and
   other benefits are in jeopardy due to global change. This leads to
   questions, such as how to address the challenges of global change in
   forest management, given the lack of knowledge and deep uncertainty
   about future developments. In addition, many of the impediments to
   implement adaptation strategies are unknown.Recent FindingsHere, we
   present an overview of results from a global survey of 754 forestry
   professionals (370 researchers and educators, 227 practicing foresters,
   37 policymakers, 64 administrators, and 56 with other or unspecified
   roles) from 61 countries across 6 continents who were interested in
   global change issues. These professionals were asked about their opinion
   regarding three different adaptation strategies: resist, adapt, and
   transform. Most respondents agreed that the majority of global change
   factors will negatively influence the ability of forests to provide
   desired ecosystem services. Similarly, they agreed about major
   challenges when implementing adaptation strategies and specifically
   whether our current knowledge base is sufficient. These concerns were
   not limited to ecological aspects, but respondents also highlighted the
   need for a better appreciation of social/political and economic
   barriers, especially regarding transformation strategies. In addition,
   the response patterns, including differences due to economic status,
   highlight the importance of developing and evaluating adaptation
   strategies in a local social-ecological context.SummaryOur study
   demonstrates a widespread perception on the part of forestry
   professionals around the world, especially among researchers and
   practitioners, that many global change factors will affect sustainable
   forest management negatively, resulting in the need for active
   silvicultural adaption. The results also suggest potential barriers to
   different adaptation strategies, particularly a relative lack of
   information and social acceptance for transform strategies. Further,
   this study highlights the importance of social and political factors and
   the need to understand the general public's values regarding adaptation
   strategies as well as how the influence of public opinion is perceived
   by forest managers.},

Title = {Another vision of sound tree and forest management: Insights from
   traditional ash shaping in the Moroccan Berber mountains},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {429},
Pages = {180-188},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The dimorphic Ash tree (Fraxinus dimorpha) is a keystone species in the
   functioning of agro-sylvo pastoral systems and livelihoods found on the
   northern slopes of the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. It grows in
   spontaneous woodlands and forests which are fully integrated within
   agro-ecosystems. Local populations have for centuries shaped ash stands
   by sequentially trimming and pollarding individual trees for providing
   fodder, house roof building material and ecosystem services for the
   overall social-ecological system. Exploitation follows very strictly
   observed 4-year cycles of exploitation of pollarded trees, which allows
   the harvesting of each individual tree for foliar forage after 4 years
   of regrowths, and at the same time shaping and letting some well-grown
   branches develop for further cycles in order to provide
   diameter-standardized poles (after 8 years) and beams (after 28-32
   years) for house roof construction. The management of tree regeneration
   is also illustrative of deep-seated Traditional Ecological Knowledge.
   Overgrazed trees or new seedlings are protected by means of stone walls.
   Resprouts with the most vigorous and straightest stems are selected and
   linked to each other, in order to favor, when growing, trunk
   anastomosis. This highly original practice allows an increase in foliage
   production of 36\% after a 4-year cycle, compared to non-anastomosed
   trees, and promotes the resilience and longevity of the trees. The main
   discrepancies in the vision of what might constitute `good' forest
   management between local stakeholders and professional foresters concern
   (1) the scale of the management unit (individual trees and overall
   forested landscape vs tree stand), (2) the partial (diffuse)
   exploitation of living trees vs intensive cycles of exploitation of the
   whole tree stand, and (3) flexibility and pro-active management of
   heterogeneity vs homogenization. This perspective offers an alternative
   basis for rethinking forest management strategies in a context of global
   change, and original insights for conserving anthropized forest
   ecosystems without excluding people.},

Title = {Why biodiversity declines as protected areas increase: the effect of the
   power of governance regimes on sustainable landscapes},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Pages = {357-369},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Achieving sustainable landscapes that integrate food production with
   biodiversity conservation remains challenging, particularly in the
   tropics where most forest clearance results from conversion to
   industrial agriculture. Land-sparing (delineating protected areas and
   intensifying agricultural production from developed land) has often been
   identified as more effective than land-sharing (mixing protection and
   production in an agro-ecological matrix) for biodiversity in the
   tropics. Nevertheless, biodiversity decline continues despite protected
   area expansion meeting global targets under international conventions.
   We developed a low-order stock-and-flow model to consider this apparent
   paradox, and used it to structure deliberations on the impacts of the
   power of governance regimes. The model articulates our shared hypothesis
   about the basic dynamics of the social-ecological system. We present
   scenarios that depict plausible biodiversity change over time under
   three different governance regimes and land-use trajectories. The
   scenarios raise the possibility that, while land-sparing gives better
   short-term results for biodiversity, land-sharing may outperform it over
   time. Two key insights derive from our deliberations. First, the forces
   that drive forest clearance for development do not necessarily oppose
   those that drive forest protection; this decoupling helps explain why
   biodiversity loss continues as protected areas increase. Second, the
   power of the governance regimes that protect existing forest can be
   weakened by protected area expansion, through lowering public discourse
   about risks from biodiversity loss, while the power of governance
   regimes for development concurrently remain strong; this helps explains
   why some REDD+ schemes are associated with increasing deforestation.
   These insights suggest novel leverage points for sustainable tropical
   landscapes, such as prioritising protected area placement by proximity
   to active agricultural frontiers, rather than by representative
   biodiversity or cost-effectiveness; or using area-based conservation
   targets that include both the extent of protected areas and of other
   remaining forest habitat. We recommend further investigation of these
   ideas, and of collaborative conceptual modelling approaches, to explore
   solutions for sustainable tropical landscapes.},

Title = {Examining the distributional equity of urban tree canopy cover and
   ecosystem services across United States cities},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB 11},
Abstract = {Examining the distributional equity of urban tree canopy cover (UTCC)
   has increasingly become an important interdisciplinary focus of
   ecologists and social scientists working within the field of
   environmental justice. However, while UTCC may serve as a useful proxy
   for the benefits provided by the urban forest, it is ultimately not a
   direct measure. In this study, we quantified the monetary value of
   multiple ecosystem services (ESD) provisioned by urban forests across
   nine U.S. cities. Next, we examined the distributional equity of UTCC
   and ESD using a number of commonly investigated socioeconomic variables.
   Based on trends in the literature, we predicted that UTCC and ESD would
   be positively associated with the variables median income and percent
   with an undergraduate degree and negatively associated with the
   variables percent minority, percent poverty, percent without a high
   school degree, percent renters, median year home built, and population
   density. We also predicted that there would be differences in the
   relationships between each response variable (UTCC and ESD) and the
   suite of socioeconomic predictor variables examined because of
   differences in how each response variable is derived. We utilized
   methods promoted within the environmental justice literature, including
   a multi-city comparative analysis, the incorporation of high-resolution
   social and environmental datasets, and the use of spatially explicit
   models. Patterns between the socioeconomic variables and UTCC and ESD
   did not consistently support our predictions, highlighting that
   inequities are generally not universal but rather context dependent. Our
   results also illustrated that although the variables UTCC and ESD had
   largely similar relationships with the predictor variables, differences
   did occur between them. Future distributional equity research should
   move beyond the use of proxies for environmental amenities when possible
   while making sure to consider that the use of ecosystem service
   estimates may result in different patterns with socioeconomic variables
   of interest. Based on our findings, we conclude that understanding and
   remedying the challenges associated with inequities requires an
   understanding of the local social-ecological system if larger
   sustainability goals are to be achieved.},

Title = {Perspectives on Climate Change, Mountain Hydrology, and Water Resources
   in the Oregon Cascades, USA},
Journal = {MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {S35-S46},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {From both social and environmental perspectives, water is the main
   connection between highland and lowland processes in mountain
   watersheds: Water flows downhill while human impacts flow uphill. For
   example, in the Oregon Cascades mountain range, geology, vegetation, and
   climate influence the hydrologic connections within watersheds. Geology
   determines which watersheds are surface runoff-dominated and which are
   groundwater-dominated. In this Mediterranean climate with dry summers,
   surface runoff watersheds will consistently experience near-zero late
   summer discharge, so declining snowpacks will have little effect on low
   flows. This contrasts with groundwater-dominated watersheds, where a
   shift from snow to rain or a decline in precipitation will reduce
   recharge, thereby reducing late summer groundwater contributions to
   streamflow. Earlier snowmelt causes forests to transpire earlier,
   resulting in decreased springtime streamflow. Reduced snowpacks lead to
   soil moisture stress, making forests more vulnerable to extensive
   wildfires and affecting the lifespan and composition of forests.
   Monitoring and quantifying these complex linkages and feedbacks require
   appropriate measurement networks. Sampling strategies often use
   watershed typology to identify where measurements should be focused.
   Such an approach should include not only established watershed
   classification parameters such as topology and geology but also
   interannual climate variability and land cover. As concerns of water
   scarcity and vulnerability move to the forefront, our watershed
   classifications should be extended to include ecosystem and
   social-ecological parameters. An integrated and agent-based modeling
   scheme called Envision has been developed to simulate alternative future
   landscapes at the watershed scale. Using fully coupled models of
   hydrology, ecosystems, and socioeconomics, decision-makers can simulate
   the effects of policy decisions in conjunction with other climate
   forcing, land use change, and economic disturbances. To understand the
   combined impacts of climate change and humans on water in mountain
   watersheds, researchers must develop integrated monitoring and modeling
   systems that explicitly include connections across eco-hydrologic and
   social-ecological systems.},

Title = {Growth and Collapse of a Resource System: an Adaptive Cycle of Change in
   Public Lands Governance and Forest Management in Alaska},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Large-scale government efforts to develop resources for societal benefit
   have often experienced cycles of growth and decline that leave behind
   difficult social and ecological legacies. To understand the origins and
   outcomes of these failures of resource governance, scholars have applied
   the framework of the adaptive cycle. In this study, we used the adaptive
   cycle as a diagnostic approach to trace the drivers and dynamics of
   forest governance surrounding a boom-bust sequence of industrial forest
   management in one of the largest-scale resource systems in U. S.
   history: the Tongass National Forest in southeastern Alaska. Our
   application of the adaptive cycle combined a historical narrative
   tracing dynamics in political, institutional, and economic subsystems
   and a longitudinal analysis of an indicator of overall system behavior
   (timber harvests). We found that federal policies in concert with global
   market changes drove transformative change in both forest governance
   (policy making) and forest management (practices), through creation and
   dissolution of subsidized long-term lease contracts. Evidence of the
   systemic resilience provided by these leases was found in the analysis
   of industry responses to market volatility before and after
   Tongass-specific federal reforms. Although the lease contracts
   stabilized the Tongass system for a period of time, they fostered a
   growing degree of rigidity that contributed to a severe industrial
   collapse and the subsequent emergence of complex social traps. Broader
   lessons from the Tongass suggest that large-scale changes occurred only
   when the nested economic and policy cycles were in coherence, and a
   systemic effort to minimize social and ecological variability ultimately
   resulted in catastrophic collapse of governance. This collapse resulted
   in a pervasive and challenging legacy that prevents Tongass
   reorganization and limits the adaptive capacity of the larger
   social-ecological system of southeastern Alaska. Although this legacy
   has inhibited system renewal for two decades, recent trends indicate the
   emergence of new opportunities for progress toward sustainable
   governance of the Tongass National Forest.},

Title = {Perception matters: an Indigenous perspective on climate change and its
   effects on forest-based livelihoods in the Amazon},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Indigenous and subsistence-oriented people are particularly sensitive to
   the impacts of climate change. Strategies to cope and adapt to those
   changes may rely on traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), which can
   play an important role for understanding global environmental change at
   the local level. We aim to provide insights regarding perceptions of
   climate change, traditional ecological knowledge, and the coping
   strategies forest-dependent Indigenous people in the Amazon adopt when
   faced with climate change impacts. The outcomes are based on a mixed set
   of methods: comprising semi-structured interviews, meteorological data,
   and photovoice in a case study approach of 49 households of the
   Indigenous Territory TCO Tacana I in lowland Bolivia. Data were
   collected in 2013 and 2015; meanwhile, the study area was hit by a
   severe extreme weather precipitation event and resulting flood in 2014.
   The results demonstrate that Tacana's perception of weather trends and
   those of Western science-trained specialists complement each other
   because they provide different sets of details. The study revealed 38
   traditional weather-related short-term indicators that underline the
   close interaction of Tacana with the environment. However, their current
   reliability has been questioned, indicating a need for further
   observation and research for potential long-term environmental change.
   Photovoice outcomes suggest that most of the negative effects during the
   extreme weather event were reported on natural capital in subsistence
   farming households. Indigenous households relied more on strong bonding
   and networking social capital (intracommunal and external), less on
   other capitals to cope with the flood event. Acknowledging TEK insights
   and changing local ecological indicators contributes information to
   assist sustainable ecosystem management and build corresponding
   resilient social systems. Local knowledge can support the understanding
   of climate and environmental change and local and regional risk
   management planning, interventions, and policy recommendations. This can
   considerably enhance the effectiveness and robustness of such strategies
   while counteracting the loss of traditional ecological knowledge.},

Title = {How can massive ecological restoration programs interplay with
   social-ecological systems? A review of research in the South China karst
   region},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {807},

Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Exploring the cost-effective pathways for restoring ecosystems is a
   fundamental aspect for scientific communities and policy-makers aiming
   for a sustainable future. The South China karst region has experienced
   severe environmental degradation because of unsustainable management
   practices in this vulnerable social-ecological context. However, it has
   also become one of the most stunning areas following its remarkable
   vegetation recovery over recent decades as a result of large-scale
   ecological restoration programs. There is an extensive body of
   literature focusing on how ecological restoration programs have altered
   the degraded environment in this region. By searching and comparing the
   published peer-reviewed articles, we reviewed the studies related to the
   effects of ecological restoration programs from the point of view of
   ecological, socio-economic, and integrated social ecological impacts, as
   well as influencing factors and restoration approaches. We found
   independent evidence to support that large-scale ecological restoration
   programs increased biomass and carbon sequestration since 2000 across
   this region. The farmers' livelihoods have spontaneously transited from
   agriculture into forestry or non-farming sectors without financial
   compensation or incentive schemes, which coincided with a positive
   correlation between the implementation of ecological restoration
   programs and poverty alleviation. However, due to a lack of clear
   ``before and after{''} comparisons, many studies have indirectly
   determined the impacts of ecological restoration with non-negligible
   uncertainties. In addition, considering the critical interactions
   between belowground and aboveground processes in karst regions, special
   attention should be given to the selection of tree species and
   restoration measures according to different bedrock types. In the
   future, to better understand the impacts of ecological restoration on
   social-ecological systems, research could be advanced by considering
   data access, context-based analysis, measurement-targeted assessment,
   and cross-scale integration. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Fluid hunter motivation in Central Africa: Effects on behaviour,
   bushmeat and income},
Journal = {PEOPLE AND NATURE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 16},
Abstract = {Individual motivation for the rural use of common-pool resources (CPRs)
   can be fluid, with the line between subsistence and commercial often
   unclear and in flux. Implications of fluid motivation are understudied
   yet important for social-ecological systems (SESs), such as bushmeat
   hunting throughout Central Africa that is essential to local
   protein/nutrition, income and culture. Making locally informative
   predictions of multiple SESs nested within a landscape-scale SES has
   been historically difficult, but community-driven participatory
   approaches provide new kinds and quantities of data, opening previously
   inaccessible doors for research and governance. We apply hierarchical
   Bayesian structural equation modelling to a novel dataset of 910 hunts
   from 111 gun and trap hunters across nine villages in Gabon, generated
   in a participatory process whereby hunters conducted GPS self-follows in
   conjunction with paraecologist surveys of their motivation, behaviour
   and offtake. We (i) establish the human behaviour driving gun-hunting
   and trapping success and predict its effect on offtake across villages
   and (ii) link fluid motivation of gun hunters to their behaviour, number
   of animals hunted, biomass yielded and income earned. Gun hunts across
   villages yielded more animals during the night than the day, and when
   hunters brought high amounts of ammunition and walked far distances from
   villages. Gun hunts were less successful when coupled with trapping
   while per-hunt success of trapping itself was generally low and
   difficult to predict. Fluid gun hunters hunted fewer animals when
   motivated strictly by subsistence, despite no reduction in ammunition
   brought or distance walked, while offtake from strictly commercial
   versus mixed motivation was the same. Numbers of animals hunted, biomass
   and income were tightly linked. We discuss the implications of these
   results for the ecological sustainability of hunting and participatory
   forecasting in bushmeat research and policy. Read the free Plain

Title = {``Towards West African coastal social-ecosystems sustainability:
   Interdisciplinary approaches{''}},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {211},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {The coastal system can be regarded as co-evolving socio-economic and
   ecological systems undergoing intense environmental pressures owing to
   the mechanisms of change exerted by human activities against a
   background of natural change. Understanding and managing ecological
   responses to these changes in the coastal areas require
   interdisciplinary approaches. Here, we develop a new approach of coastal
   socio-ecological systems (CSES) based on earlier work on the press-pulse
   dynamics (PPD) socio-ecological systems. To show the relevance of the
   modified (mPPD) framework, we applied it to two unique features
   (mangroves and beach systems) of the western African coastal (WAC)
   systems. Then, we constructed plausible 21st-century coastal systems
   scenarios at the coast based on a set of descriptive indicators
   (population growth, economic development, environmental quality,
   governance, technological advancement and climate change) for a better
   understanding and sustainable management planning of WAC systems. We
   found that different indicators characterizing each scenario will exert
   different pressures on the WAC systems, under the forms of the long-term
   press and short-term pulse events. The cross-cutting narratives of the
   different future scenarios in the face of climate change using the mPPD
   framework offer valuable insight into the development of WAC management
   strategies, policies and other agendas. It helps to define the plausible
   implications of following, or not, a particular management path. The
   inconsistencies between the aspirations of different resource users and
   lack of coordination of human activities taking place on land and in the
   coastal zone, partly due to fragmentation of institutions and weak
   coastal governance are revealed. In this context, the mPPDCSES framework
   can be used to investigate how ecosystems can experience different
   (intensities of) press as well as different frequencies of the pulse.
   Thus, its adaptability to construct future coastal vulnerability
   scenarios adds to its usefulness as a robust and dependable integrated
   coastal zone management tool.},

Abstract = {Managing a complex social-ecological system requires data about the many
   social and ecological variables characterizing it and about their
   interactions. While the selection of research topics has its own, mostly
   unpredictable dynamics and contingencies, there has been a recent surge
   of interest regarding the involvement of non-academic stakeholders in
   suggesting research topics and identifying perceived knowledge gaps
   regarding the management of complex social-ecological systems.
   Decision-makers will invariably be confronted with limitations regarding
   resources to be allocated to the study of various systems components,
   and regarding the processing capacity of scientists and other
   stakeholders alike. Matang forest is one of the longest-managed
   mangroves in the world and provides a widely cited example of
   silvicultural management for charcoal and pole production, while
   providing a range of other ecosystem services. We applied the nominal
   group technique (NGT) to identify research priorities for Matang, as it
   provides a systematic and participatory approach to identify collective
   priorities while also reducing bias. The method consists of two rounds,
   during which participants were asked to reflect first individually, and
   then collectively, about key characteristics of mangrove management and
   about research priorities in Matang. The results were compared to the
   recommendations of the scientific literature. NGT provides a rapid,
   robust and systematic approach to identify research priorities for
   mangrove management and can hence be a timely method to support
   decision-makers across South-East Asia in guiding resource allocation
   toward research needs in times of increasing mangrove degradation. This
   is the first time that the application of NGT has been documented in a
   mangrove context. Moreover, NGT is not yet being used frequently in
   natural resources management, hence in documenting our NGT application,
   we aim to contribute to the development of a the NGT body of knowledge
   beyond mere mangrove forest settings. Rapid methods (such as NGT) to
   identify pressing research priorities are needed to guide resource
   allocation and investment of time and scientific capacity based on a
   systematic and pluralistic assessment.},

Title = {An impact assessment tool to identify, quantify and select optimal
   social-economic, ecological and health outcomes of civic environmental
   management interventions, in Durban South Africa},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {302},

Abstract = {Using an environmental impact assessment (EIA) methodology, we provide a
   novel approach to identify and assess social-ecological outcomes from
   civic ecology interventions. We quantified the impact significance of
   six civic (community led) interventions implemented by the Wise Wayz
   Water Care (WWWC) local community programme (solid waste management,
   water quality monitoring, invasive alien plant control, crop production,
   recycling and community engagement), in two communities, situated in
   urban to peri-urban/rural environments in Durban, South Africa.
   Interventions resulted in 37 outcomes, of which 36 were positive and one
   negative. The resulting significance scores from the impact assessment
   allowed for interventions and their outcomes to be compared. The
   socio-economic outcomes were the greatest (21), followed by ecological
   (11) and health outcomes (6). Outcomes included access to education and
   training; improved quality of life; improved terrestrial and aquatic
   ecosystems; increase in recreation and cultural uses of natural areas;
   reduced health risks and increased nutrition. The most significant
   ecological outcomes resulted from invasive alien plant control, followed
   by solid waste removal and water quality monitoring. The greatest health
   outcomes resulted from solid waste removal and vegetable gardens,
   whereas the greatest social-economic outcomes resulted from the general
   operation of WWWC, solid waste removal, and invasive alien plant
   control. We demonstrate that investments in natural areas can deliver
   not only on enhancements in ecosystems and their services, but also for
   local community socioeconomic and health benefits. This study provides
   an intervention quantifying tool for practitioners to select optimal
   local management interventions, that can be aligned with desired
   outcomes related to specific community challenges and policy
   requirements. In so doing, this work shows the critical role that civic
   interventions play to ensure sustainability, and emphasises how
   social-ecological systems and ecosystem services perspectives can be
   used in practice towards achieving sustainable outcomes.},

Abstract = {Given the substantial contributions of forest biodiversity and ecosystem
   services to society, forest sciences have a large potential to
   contribute to the integrity and sustainability of our future. This is
   especially true when the roles of biodiversity for sustaining ecosystem
   services are considered. The rapid expansion of sustainable forest
   management (SFM) has resulted in the adoption of various forest
   management frameworks intended to safeguard biodiversity. Concurrently,
   the importance of forest ecosystem services has been increasingly
   recognized. Although some initiatives aimed at conserving both
   biodiversity and ecosystem services are emerging, knowledge gaps still
   exist about their relationships and potential trade-offs in forests.
   Given recent advancements, increasing opportunities and some lags in
   forest ecology, further research on biodiversity, ecosystem functions
   and services will play substantial roles in the development of SFM
   practices. Here, we identified key issues including (i) relationships
   between biodiversity and ecosystem function as a foundation of
   ecological integrity, (ii) resilience thinking to better prepare for and
   adapt to environmental changes, (iii) social-ecological perspectives
   that facilitate real-world conservation and management and (iv)
   theory-driven restoration that bridges science and practice. Thus, we
   illustrate priorities and future possibilities in applied ecology
   studies in forests, which will help society and ecosystems to build
   capacity and resilience to face uncertainty in the changing
   environment.Synthesis and applications. Under substantial human
   influences, forests are highly likely to be largely altered, potentially
   leading to the emergence of novel ecosystems or alternative stable
   states. Management thus needs more flexible, novel measures to address
   the significant uncertainty this generates. Resilience-based approaches
   are important to respond adaptively to future changes and cope with
   surprises, potentially providing multiple options. Although challenges
   exist, theory should play an important role in managing, conserving and
   restoring forest ecosystems. The issues discussed here should receive
   further attention in the context of the multiple goals of sustainable
   forest management.},

Title = {Systematic Planning and Ecosystem-Based Management as Strategies to
   Reconcile Mangrove Conservation with Resource Use},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {About 120 million people worldwide live within 10 km of large mangrove
   forests, and many of them directly depend on the goods and services
   provided by these ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how to
   synchronize ecological definitions and legal conservation strategies
   regarding mangroves, especially in developing countries, such as Brazil.
   The influence of human populations' socio-economic context in mangrove
   conservation policies, as well associated challenges in incorporating
   this influence, are underestimated or, often, largely ignored.
   Considering the recent threats emerging from changes in legislation and
   the lack of spatial and social-ecological integrated data to plan
   mangrove conservation in Brazil, this paper aims to answer the following
   questions: (1) What suitable measures could managers and other decision
   makers adopt for efficient mangrove conservation planning?; (2) What are
   the site-specific, social-ecological aspects that need to be taken into
   account when deciding on conservation and management strategies?; and
   (3) How could science contribute to the development of these measures?
   In order to achieve an ecosystem-based management approach, mangrove
   ecosystems should not be divided into sub-systems, but instead treated
   as an integrated system. Furthermore, interconnections with other
   coastal ecosystems must be assessed and taken into account. This is
   crucial for effective systematic conservation planning. Also, most of
   the particular social-ecological aspects in the different types of
   mangrove ecosystems along the Brazilian coast, and how those differences
   might be considered while planning for conservation, remain poorly
   understood. Based on similar drivers of change, geological features, and
   likely impacts of climate change, a macro-unit approach is proposed to
   group mangrove systems along the Brazilian coast and guide national
   policies. This paper draws parallels with management approaches
   worldwide to find common points and hence lessons to be applied in other
   regional realms. It considers the issues of legal vulnerability and
   needs for social-ecological data on mangroves, contributing toward
   systematic conservation planning and ecosystem-based management for
   these ecosystems.},

Title = {Agents, Individuals, and Networks: Modeling Methods to Inform Natural
   Resource Management in Regional Landscapes},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Landscapes are complex systems. Landscape dynamics are the result of
   multiple interacting biophysical and socioeconomic processes that are
   linked across a broad range of spatial, temporal, and organizational
   scales. Understanding and describing landscape dynamics poses enormous
   challenges and demands the use of new multiscale approaches to modeling.
   In this synthesis article, we present three regional systems-i.e., a
   forest system, a marine system, and an agricultural system and describe
   how hybrid, bottom-up modeling of these systems can be used to represent
   linkages across scales and between subsystems. Through the use of these
   three examples, we describe how modeling can be used to simulate
   emergent system responses to different conservation policy and
   management scenarios from the bottom up, thereby increasing our
   understanding of important drivers and feedback loops within a
   landscape. The first case study involves the use of an individual-based
   modeling approach to simulate the effects of forest harvesting on the
   movement patterns of large mammals in Canada's boreal forest and the
   resulting emergent population dynamics. This model is being used to
   inform forest harvesting and management guidelines. The second case
   study combines individual and agent-based approaches to simulate the
   dynamics of individual boats and whales in a marine park. This model is
   being used to inform decision-makers on how to mitigate the impacts of
   maritime traffic on whales in the Saint Lawrence Estuary in eastern
   Canada. The third example is a case study of biodiversity conservation
   efforts on the Eyre Peninsula, South Australia. In this example, the
   social-ecological system is represented as a complex network of
   interacting components. Methods of network analysis can be used to
   explore the emergent responses of the system to changes in the network
   structure or configuration, thus informing managers about the resilience
   of the system. These three examples illustrate how bottom-up modeling
   approaches may contribute to a new landscape science based on scenario
   building, to find solutions that meet the multiple objectives of
   integrated resource management in social-ecological systems.},

Title = {Conserving and restoring old growth in frequent-fire forests: Cycles of
   disruption and recovery},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {I provide a synthesis of the papers in the Special Issue, The
   Conservation and Restoration of Old Growth in Frequent-fire Forests of
   the American West. These papers - the product of an Old Growth Writing
   Workshop, held at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona on
   18 - 19 April 2006 represent the ideas of 25 workshop participants who
   argue for a new attitude toward managing old growth in the frequent-fire
   forests of the American West. Unlike the lush, old-growth rainforests of
   the Pacific Northwest, the dry, frequent-fire forests of the western
   United States evolved with surface fires that disturbed the system with
   such regularity that young trees were almost always killed. When
   saplings did survive, they grew beyond the harm of frequent surface
   fires and, ultimately, attained the characteristics that define old
   growth in these systems. This system worked well, producing old-growth
   trees in abundance, until the onset of Euro-American settlement in the
   mid-to late-19(th) century. The arrival of these settlers put in motion
   an interplay of unprecedented social, political, economic, and
   ecological forces ( e. g., removal of Native Americans and their
   fire-based land management systems, overgrazing of the understory,
   aggressive logging, establishment of federal land management agencies,
   implementation of a federal fire suppression policy). These activities
   have culminated in 1) overly dense forested ecosystems that are now on
   the verge of collapse because of catastrophic fires ( i.e., crown fire
   at the landscape level; the Rodeo-Chediski Fire) and insect outbreaks,
   2) the emergence of conservation-minded environmental legislation and
   policy, and 3) greater levels of interaction between citizens, federal
   agencies, and fire-prone landscapes. Recognizing the tenuous ecological
   situation of these forests, restoration ecologists, foresters, and
   others have developed ways to return historic ecological processes and
   lower tree densities to these forests. However, their efforts are not
   without challenges, including working with communities and citizens,
   serving as a bridge between entrenched bureaucracies ( i.e., federal
   agencies and environmental groups), balancing both ecological and
   economic interests, and producing new applied technologies and
   science-based policy to advance conservation and restoration efforts
   aimed at preserving and developing old growth within a healthy forest
   environment.},

Title = {How to manage urban disturbances: Focused on social-ecological
   vulnerability to fine dust pollution},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {104},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Since the pattern of fine dust pollution varies regionally, it is
   necessary to identify areas vulnerable to fine dust pollution based on
   local community and environmental infrastructure and then plan green
   infrastructure for these areas. The purpose of this study is to analyze
   the suitability area of green infrastructure systems to improve urban
   resilience with regards to fine dust pollution. Regarding the research
   methods, first, a search for previous studies is conducted to establish
   an evaluation index for the resilience to fine dust pollution. Second,
   data on the environmental and social factors of the case study site
   (Suwon, Republic of Korea) are collected and mapped based on the
   resilience evaluation indices established for fine dust pollution.
   Third, these indices are used to confirm that regional differences
   caused by landscape fragmentation exist with regards to resilience to
   fine dust pollution. This study yields two key outcomes. Firstly, the
   indicators associated with resilience against fine dust pollution are
   categorized into environmental and social factors. Environmental factors
   encompass the composition of pollutants (including concentrations of
   PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3, CO, and SO2), proximity to roads, and
   environmental assets such as well-established roadside green spaces,
   parks, forests, and thriving vegetation. Meanwhile, social factors
   incorporate considerations of social welfare services and air pollutant
   emission facilities. These factors contribute to the comprehensive
   evaluation indices, encompassing exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive
   capacity concerning fine dust pollution. Secondly, the spatial analysis
   of fine dust pollution within the case study area reveals that regions
   exhibiting robust social-ecological system adaptive capacities tend to
   demonstrate heightened resilience against fine dust pollution.
   Conversely, areas characterized by elevated exposure and sensitivity to
   this issue exhibit reduced resilience. Moreover, the investigation into
   landscape fragmentation highlights a strong correlation between
   resilience against fine dust pollution and the fragmentation of green
   spaces. This study deviates from previous research endeavors through its
   innovative approach of strategically planning green infrastructure in
   vulnerable zones, aligning with local characteristics. It further
   introduces distinct resilience evaluation indicators tailored to fine
   dust pollution and integrates considerations of the spatial distribution
   of social-ecological systems, thereby contributing to a nuanced
   understanding of this complex issue.},

Title = {Cultural drivers of reforestation in tropical forest groves of the
   Western Ghats of India},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {329},
Pages = {393-400},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Sacred forest groves in the Western Ghats of India are small fragments
   of tropical forest that have received protection due to religious
   beliefs and cultural practices. These forest fragments are an example of
   community-based conservation and they serve as refugia for many
   forest-dwelling species in otherwise highly anthropogenic tropical
   forest-agriculture landscapes of the Indian Western Ghats. Many of these
   sacred forest groves are considered ancient woodlands, but there is very
   little information on their origins. For instance: How old are these
   sacred groves? Are they relics of forest that was once continuous or are
   they patches of regenerated vegetation? How do changes in the
   surrounding landscape influence the vegetation in these groves? Based on
   palaeoecological reconstruction in two such sacred forest groves, we
   determined the age of these forest fragments. Both reconstructions
   indicate transition from non-forest open landscape to tree-covered
   landscape at these sites. These finding from two sacred groves challenge
   the common perception that sacred forest groves are remnants of
   once-continuous forest; instead, some sacred groves such as those
   studied might be regenerated forest patches that are approximately 400
   years old. This further raises a number of questions about the drivers
   of reforestation in these groves. What were the social and cultural
   circumstances which led to the recovery of forest within these patches?
   How did land tenure influence forest recovery? What role did religious
   beliefs play in forest restoration? Using Wallace's (1956) framework of
   `cultural revitalization' and based on historical literature and
   palaeoecological analysis of the two sacred groves, this paper examines
   the drivers of reforestation in the Western Ghats of India. It suggests
   various social, ecological and economic drivers of such revitalization,
   recognizing strong linkages between the `social' and the `ecological'
   within the social-ecological system of sacred forest groves. This
   example of reforestation suggests that contemporary restoration of
   forests needs to operate at a landscape scale and look at restoration as
   a social-ecological intervention in forest management. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {Analysis of Olive Grove Destruction by <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>
   Bacterium on the Land Surface Temperature in Salento Detected Using
   Satellite Images},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Agricultural activity replaces natural vegetation with cultivated land
   and it is a major cause of local and global climate change. Highly
   specialized agricultural production leads to extensive monoculture
   farming with a low biodiversity that may cause low landscape resilience.
   This is the case on the Salento peninsula, in the Apulia Region of
   Italy, where the Xylella fastidiosa bacterium has caused the mass
   destruction of olive trees, many of them in monumental groves. The
   historical land cover that characterized the landscape is currently in a
   transition phase and can strongly affect climate conditions. This study
   aims to analyze how the destruction of olive groves by X. fastidiosa
   affects local climate change. Land surface temperature (LST) data
   detected by Landsat 8 and MODIS satellites are used as a proxies for
   microclimate mitigation ecosystem services linked to the evolution of
   the land cover. Moreover, recurrence quantification analysis was applied
   to the study of LST evolution. The results showed that olive groves are
   the least capable forest type for mitigating LST, but they are more
   capable than farmland, above all in the summer when the air temperature
   is the highest. The differences in the average LST from 2014 to 2020
   between olive groves and farmland ranges from 2.8 degrees C to 0.8
   degrees C. Furthermore, the recurrence analysis showed that X.
   fastidiosa was rapidly changing the LST of the olive groves into values
   to those of farmland, with a difference in LST reduced to less than a
   third from the time when the bacterium was identified in Apulia six
   years ago. The change generated by X. fastidiosa started in 2009 and
   showed more or less constant behavior after 2010 without substantial
   variation; therefore, this can serve as the index of a static situation,
   which can indicate non-recovery or non-transformation of the dying olive
   groves. Failure to restore the initial environmental conditions can be
   connected with the slow progress of the uprooting and replacing infected
   plants, probably due to attempts to save the historic aspect of the
   landscape by looking for solutions that avoid uprooting the diseased
   plants. This suggests that social-ecological systems have to be more
   responsive to phytosanitary epidemics and adapt to ecological processes,
   which cannot always be easily controlled, to produce more resilient
   landscapes and avoid unwanted transformations.},

Title = {What do scientists and managers know about soil biodiversity?
   Comparative knowledge mapping for sustainable forest management},
Journal = {FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {119},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Soil biodiversity is crucial for maintaining forest health and
   safeguarding forest ecosystem services delivery, but it is under
   increasing human pressure. Forest management puts pressure on soil
   biodiversity, but has also the potential to support soil biodiversity
   recovery, depending on which decisions forest managers make. These
   decisions are highly influenced by managers' perception and
   understanding. Nevertheless, insights into forest managers'
   understanding of soils and their biodiversity are largely lacking. This
   paper addresses this gap by studying private and public forest managers'
   understanding of soil biodiversity and comparing their level of
   knowledge with scientists' knowledge. In addition, this paper assesses
   the effects of context on understanding by comparing between two regions
   (NW of Flanders, Belgium, and NE of Romania). Specifically, knowledge
   was elicited using semi-structured interviews based on an integrated
   framework. The interviews were coded and analyzed using a Fuzzy
   Cognitive Mapping approach. In total, 24 interviews were conducted after
   selecting respondents using a purposive sampling design. Our results
   indicate that forest managers are aware of the crucial role of soil
   biodiversity and possess practical and context-specific understanding,
   but lack in-depth knowledge related to ecosystem processes and functions
   and soil state variables, compared to scientists. In addition, managers
   did not seem to explicitly consider soil biodiversity in their
   management decisions, but instead seemed to treat soil more as a black
   box. While scientists had a more detailed understanding, their
   understanding also depended on their background as researchers and
   mostly overlooked practical, site-specific implications. Moreover, we
   found that local context influenced respondents' understanding,
   especially related to drivers and pressures that affect soil
   biodiversity. Hence, communication strategies oriented towards forest
   managers seem suitable to maximize adoption of adaptive management
   practices that support soil biodiversity. These strategies should go
   beyond awareness raising and specifically explain ecosystem processes
   and functions linked to forest soil biodiversity to improve managers'
   in-depth understanding, while taking their socio-economic and forestry
   context into account. Further, policy design should enhance conditions
   for knowledge exchange and discussion about soil biodiversity. The
   methodology presented in this study might help such knowledge
   integration of scientists and forest managers in order to combine
   in-depth understanding of soil biodiversity and applicability of
   management practices in specific forest contexts.},

Title = {Heterogeneous Actors in a Dialog: Insights and Perceptions concerning

Journal = {ALLGEMEINE FORST UND JAGDZEITUNG},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {188},
Number = {5-6},
Pages = {73-84},
Abstract = {The challenge of decision-making under a changing climate in forestry
   has become a decent part in debates and in scientific discourses. This
   paper uses a socio-scientific approach to this topic. It is examined, if
   and how forest's actors identify risk due to forestry in climate change.
   For this purpose a four year lasting stakeholder project has been
   analysed. In this project, actors of the forest policy area were invited
   to discuss in a dialog forum central aspects of future forestry in
   Germany due to changing climate conditions and rising uncertainties. The
   group consisted of representatives of forest owners (state, municipal,
   private), conservation and environmental organizations as well as
   authorities, timber industry and research centers (Tab. 1). The debates
   took place as a round table; identification of topics to discuss was
   committed to stakeholders themselves (Tab. 2). All debates were lined by
   scientific or expert input. The actors have been identified before in an
   `analysis of discourse field', a method which helps to minimize
   subjective bias in determine a discourse arena. This turned out to be a
   reasonable method for identifying actors.
   For this paper all six workshops held in the project have been examined
   under aspects of risk research. It was examined, which risks are
   identified by stakeholders concerning future forestry in a changing
   climate. Therefore, a category scheme has been established in accordance
   with principles of social science (openness, naturalistics), defining
   following risk types: physic, economic and social (Tab. 3).
   Analysis of the workshops showed, that especially physical and
   economical risks have been addressed by stakeholders. Also addressed but
   not as prominently have been aspects of social risks. Concerning
   identified physical risks (loss of trees, diseases, etc.) actors agreed
   due to urgency. As economical risks, loss of cultivation area and
   investments in an unknown future have been identified. When social
   function of forests is endangered or limited, social risks are
   identified. A category scheme is indispensable for analyzing data, but
   in reality some risks are connected cascading. During research it turned
   out that results can be more precise, if singular risks of a cascading
   risk complex are evaluated by actors interested in this risk and not by
   the whole group together, as it happened in the presented study. In
   addition it can be helpful to focus on local level instead of regional
   to effectuate a higher identification of actors with the dealing topic.},

Title = {Agroecosystem composition and landscape ecological risk evolution of
   rice terraces in the southern mountains, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {145},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Mountain rice terrace agriculture is a critical land use practice in
   southern China. Analyzing the vertical structure of rice terraces
   systems and the coupled evolution of their human-land relationship from
   a mountainous stereoscopic perspective is significant to regional
   resource use and sustainable agricultural development. This study took
   the Xijiang Township and Jiabang Township in the mountainous area of
   Southwest China as the research object, based on the unique rice farming
   environment in the mountainous region, to divide the typical types of
   the four-element isomorphic (FEI) of the regional forest, village,
   river, and rice terraces from the perspective of vertical
   differentiation. The spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of rice
   terraces based on the view of the social-ecological system were explored
   by using the land use data of Jiabang Township from 1962 (1977 in
   Xijiang Township) to 2020, and methods such as mathematical statistics,
   sample transect analysis. The ecological risk model was also employed to
   analyze the spatiotemporal variation characteristics and landscape
   stability of ecological risk in mountain rice terraces systems. The
   study showed that: (1) The rice terraces showed the
   ``forestterraces-village-river{''} (F-T-V-R),
   ``forest-village-terraces-river{''} (F-V-T-R), and
   ``forest-terraces-village-terracesriver{''} (F-T-V-T-R), and the rice
   terraces in each differentiation type experienced a continuous
   evolutionary feature of ``development-stabilization-local shrinkage and
   shifted.{''} (2) The mixed production trend of ``main rice and the
   auxiliary dry land{''} in the rice terraces landscape was gradually
   highlighted, and the degree of landscape abandonment and fragmentation
   was deepened, and the ``F-T-V-T-R{''} structure had the highest
   landscape stability in long-term development. (3) The ecological risks
   of each landscape type showed the characteristics of
   ``increase-stabilization-decrease{''} in different time series
   evolution. (4) Although the ``F-T-V-T-R{''} landscape types in the two
   areas were at a high-risk level in the long term, the long-term changes
   are less fluctuating, and the landscape security stability is the
   highest. The research results comprehensively reflected the
   spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of the landscape spatial
   pattern of rice terraces, and revealed the reflection of the FEI
   vertical differentiation structure on the regional social ecosystem and
   human-land relationship, which can help us to promote the optimal
   utilization of traditional rice terraces resources in the mountains and
   promote the sustainable development of rice agriculture.},

   conservation interventions for sustainable non-timber forest products},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {131},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Rural households in developing countries often depend on non-timber
   forest products (NTFPs), including foods, traditional medicines,
   fuelwood, fodder, and construction and craft materials such as bamboo
   and rattan, for their livelihoods, but the forests that supply NTFPs are
   subject to competition from other land uses. NTFP collectors who are
   unable to sustain their livelihoods because of changes caused in the
   NTFP collection environment by deforestation and degradation may even
   convert surrounding forests to agricultural land to compensate for their
   reduced incomes. This feedback loop of deforestation and degradation can
   create further conflicts among natural resource users and undermine
   long-term development goals. Here, we aimed to advance the discussion of
   forest conservation interventions in protected areas in developing
   countries-particularly the discussion of patrolling strategies in and
   around existing wildlife sanctuaries-by presenting a new approach that
   uses the case of NTFP collection and a human geography perspective. We
   used a structured questionnaire composed of closed questions to measure
   the awareness of village households of the impacts of deforestation
   and/or illegal extraction of trees on NTFP collection over a short
   period of time (2014-2016) near the Prey Long Wildlife Sanctuary in the
   eastern part of the Kampong Thom Province, Cambodia. Our survey was
   based on the conceptual framework of Bohensky and Lynam (Ecol. Soc. 10,
   11; 2005) that people in complex adaptive systems change their behaviour
   after becoming aware of the impact or consequences of a change. The
   probability of a village having an affected household (i.e., a household
   that was aware of the impact) was predicted by using generalized linear
   mixed models. By using identified geospatial indicators of environmental
   and socioeconomic aspects, including distance between the village and
   the wildlife sanctuary, size of deforested area per capita in 2014-2016
   within a 10-km radius of the village and proportion of households in the
   village that collect NTFPs for cash income, we predicted the spatial
   distribution of villages with affected NTFP-collecting households.
   Priority areas for NTFP collection were then mapped with reference to
   the identified indicators. By using these results, we present an
   approach to breaking the deforestation feedback loop by identifying
   priority areas for patrolling and other forest conservation
   interventions in the wildlife sanctuary.},

Title = {Rainforest conservation in Mexico's lowland Maya area: Integrating local
   meanings of conservation and land-use dynamics},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {448},

Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {In several tropical forested areas in which biodiversity conservation
   and indigenous cultures are interwoven, current conservation policies do
   not consider how the indigenous communities understand the concept of
   conservation that is promoted and implemented by conservation programs
   led by external actors, nor do they consider local traditional practices
   of resource management. To move towards more inclusive conservation
   policies that take these two aspects into account, research is required
   in indigenous settings that can inform policy makers. The present study,
   carried out in the lowland Maya area of Mexico, aims to investigate
   local meanings of rainforest conservation and dynamics of land use in
   two Maya common property holdings or `ejidos' (Noh cah and X-Maben). The
   study used a Social-Ecological Systems approach comprising: (i) the Maya
   communities and their local meanings of conservation as a Social
   Subsystem, assessed through social surveys, and (ii) the rainforest of
   each studied ejido - which was regarded as an Ecological Subsystem and
   assessed through satellite images (from 2000 to 2012). In the former,
   interviewees were asked: ``when you hear the phrase `conservation of the
   rainforest' what do you think is being said?{''} They were also asked if
   there were local words in Maya or Spanish that were similar in meaning
   to the aforementioned phrase. The results relating to the meanings of
   conservation demonstrate that Maya people, who rely on the rainforest
   for multiple livelihoods, understand two types of meanings for looking
   after the rainforest; one promoted by governmental conservation
   programs, and the other called Kanan K'aax, a Maya phrase that
   represents their customary or community-based rainforest conservation.
   Differences between these two models of conservation encompass
   differences with respect to scale, gender and the Maya people's own
   cultural practices. The results of the local dynamics of land use
   demonstrate that the landscapes of both study sites are dominated by
   mature rainforest (ranging from 73.9-82.7\%), and are therefore in a
   good state of conservation, and that their agricultural frontiers have
   not expanded. Our empirical results are valuable in terms of informing
   the scientific community about the state of rainforest conservation in
   the Maya Zone, and providing policy makers (from the Maya area and
   elsewhere) with information to devise new, more inclusive conservation
   policies that take full account of the indigenous cultural practices of
   rainforest management.},

Title = {Agent-based modelling of the social-ecological nature of poverty traps
   in southwestern Madagascar},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {190},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {CONTEXT: In Madagascar land use pressure on natural resources has
   increased drastically over the last decades. For subsistence farmers
   this situation often leads to an accelerated unsustainable exploitation
   of resources with negative consequences for their livelihood, which can
   be described as a social-ecological trap (SET).
   OBJECTIVE: Our paper seeks to understand the dynamics of SETs and
   demonstrates a model-driven scenario on how farmers may escape the trap.
   For this, we developed a spatially explicit empirical agent-based model
   (SEALM) to simulate possible future trends of farmers? crop management
   and the effects of these trends on the environment, household (HH)
   economy, food self-sufficiency (FSS) and HH coping strategies to food
   insecurity.
   METHODS: Using links between social-ecological system (SES) components
   that depict real-world conditions, SEALM focuses on three village
   communities for which extensive data were available from
   transdisciplinary research comprising surveys, remote sensing analysis,
   and field-based validation. To identify the most significant parameters
   and to quantify how parameter uncertainty influences model outcomes,
   local and global sensitivity analyses were performed. Simulations were
   conducted in annual time steps from 2015 to 2045 to depict two
   contrasting scenarios: A baseline scenario (A) and an improved crop
   management scenario to increase FSS (B). For scenario assessments we
   used direct simulation outputs (FSS, HH income, land cover) and further
   indices calculated based on model outcomes (coping strategy index,
   landscape fragmentation, and the Gini coefficient).
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Scenario A predicted expansion of cropland and
   fragmentation of remaining forest areas. Simulations at each time step
   displayed how SET situations occurred due to self-reinforcing ecological
   and social constraints and affected HHs future coping capacity to food
   shortages. Here, FSS was insufficient (< 1.0) for most HHs and was <0.5
   for years with rainfall deficits. Scenario B demonstrated a way to
   navigate out of the SET by increasing crop yields reflecting improved
   management and resulting in significantly higher FSS values and a lower
   coping strategy index. SEALM considers the heterogeneity in farmers?
   abilities, constraints, behaviour and decision-making and depicts the
   dynamic interplay of SES components contributing to SET.
   SIGNIFICANCE: SEALM serves as a discussion support with local
   stakeholders and experts and it allows to better tailor site specific
   land use recommendations due to its empirical driven and spatially
   explicit character. However, strategies and interventions that lower the
   poverty rate in the long term and encourage exit out of trap situations
   require major policy changes.},

Title = {Navigating the complexities of the forest land sharing vs sparing
   logging dilemma: analytical insights through the governance theory of
   social-ecological systems dynamics},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Month = {JAN 29},
Abstract = {This study addresses the ongoing debate on forest land-sparing vs
   land-sharing, aiming to identify effective strategies for both species
   conservation and timber exploitation. Previous studies, guided by
   control theory, compared sharing and sparing by optimizing logging
   intensity along a presumed trade -off between timber yield and
   ecological outcomes. However, the realism of this trade -off assumption
   is questioned by ecological and governance theories. This article
   introduces a mathematical model of Social-Ecological System (SES)
   dynamics, distinguishing selective logging intensification between
   sharing and sparing, with associated governance requirements. The model
   assumes consistent rules for logging, replanting, conservation support,
   access regulation, socio-economic, soil and climate conditions. Actors,
   each specialized in sustainable logging and replanting of a single
   species, coexist with various tree species in the same space for land
   sharing, contrasting with separate actions on monospecific stands for
   sparing. In sharing scenarios, a gradient of intensification is created
   from 256 combinations of selective logging for a forest with eight
   coexisting tree species. This is compared with eight scenarios of
   monospecific stands adjacent to a spared eight-species forest area
   safeguarded from logging. Numerical projections over 100 years rank
   sparing and sharing options based on forest-level tree biodiversity,
   carbon storage, and timber yield. The findings underscore the
   context-specific nature of the problem but identify simple heuristics to
   optimize both sparing and sharing practices. Prioritizing the most
   productive tree species is effective when selecting sparing, especially
   when timber yield and biodiversity are benchmarks. Conversely, sharing
   consistently outperforms sparing when carbon storage and biodiversity
   are main criteria. Sharing excels across scenarios considering all three
   criteria, provided a greater diversity of actors access and coexist in
   the shared space under collective rules ensuring independence and
   sustainable logging and replanting. The present model addresses some
   limitations in existing sparing-sharing theory by aligning with
   established ecological theories exploring the intricate relationship
   between disturbance practices, productivity and ecological outcomes. The
   findings also support a governance hypothesis from the 2009 Nobel Prize
   in Economics (E. Ostrom) regarding the positive impact on biodiversity
   and productivity of increasing polycentricity, i.e., expanding the
   number of independent species controllers' channels (loggers/
   replanters/supporters/regulators). This hypothesis, rooted in Ashby's
   law of requisite variety from control theory, suggests that resolving
   the sharing/sparing dilemma may depend on our ability to predict the
   yield -ecology performances of sparing (in heterogeneous landscapes) vs
   of sharing (in the same space) from their respective levels of
   ``polycentric requisite variety{''}.},

Abstract = {BackgroundPlot-based monitoring has yielded much information on the
   taxonomic diversity and carbon (C) storage in tropical lowland forests
   of the Amazon basin. This has resulted in an improved understanding of
   the relationship between lowland forest biomass dynamics and global
   change drivers, such as climate change and atmospheric CO2
   concentration. Much less attention has been paid to the mountain
   ecosystems of South America that comprise montane forests and alpine
   vegetation (paramo, puna, high Andean grasslands, wetlands, and alpine
   heath). This vegetation complex provides a variety of ecosystem services
   and forms a natural laboratory along various physiographic, geological
   and evolutionary history/biogeography, and land use history
   gradients.AimsHere, we review existing empirical understanding and
   model-based approaches to quantify the contribution of mountain
   ecosystems to ecosystem service provision in the rapidly changing
   socioecological setting of the South American mountains. The objective
   of this paper is to outline a broad road map for the implementation of
   mountain vegetation into dynamic global vegetation models (DGVM) for use
   in Earth System Models (ESM), based on our current understanding of
   their structure and function and of their responsiveness to global
   change drivers. We also identify treeline processes, critical in
   mountain ecosystems, as key missing elements in DGVMs/ESMs, and thus
   explore in addition a treeline model.MethodsStocktaking of the
   availability of empirical data was undertaken from eight research sites
   along the Andes and in south-eastern Brazil. Out of eight sites, two
   (one each in Venezuela and Brazil) had some climate, ecological and
   ecophysiological data potentially suitable to parametrise a DGVM. Tree
   biomass data were available for six sites. A preliminary assessment of
   the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) DGVM was made to
   identify gaps in available data and their impacts on model
   parametrisation and calibration. Additionally, the potential
   climate-determined elevation of the treeline was modelled to check the
   DGVM for its ability to identify the transition between the montane
   forest and alpine vegetation.ResultsOutcomes of the evaluation of the
   JULES land surface model identified the following key processes in
   montane forests: temperature-related decrease in net primary production,
   respiration, and allocation to above-ground biomass and increase in soil
   C stocks with elevation. There was a variable agreement between
   simulated biomass and those derived from field measurements via
   allometric equations.ConclusionsWe identified major gaps between data
   availability and the needs for process-based modelling of South American
   mountain vegetation and its dynamics in DGVMs. To bridge this gap, we
   propose a transdisciplinary network, composed of members of the
   theoretical/modelling and empirical scientific communities, to study the
   natural dynamics of mountain ecosystems and their responses to global
   change drivers locally, regionally and at the continental scale, within
   a social-ecological system framework. The work presented here forms the
   basis for the design of data collection from field measurements and
   instrumental monitoring stations to parametrise and verify DGVMs. The
   network is designed to collaborate with and complement existing
   long-term research initiatives in the region and will adopt existing
   standard field protocols. Complementary protocols will ensure
   compatibility between field data collection and data needed for
   process-based and empirical models.},

Abstract = {In recent decades, ecosystem theory has revisited the meaning of human
   action. There is a growing tendency to recognize that, once ``left
   alone{''}, human modified ecosystems do not return to their primitive
   state. Recently, this notion has been radically advocated by a group of
   ecologists who propose the concept of ``emerging{''} or ``novel{''}
   ecosystems. Emerging ecosystems are the direct result of either intense
   human modification of preserved ecosystems or the abandonment of
   established land uses (crops, pastures, planted forests etc.). These
   ecosystems present locally unprecedented patterns of species composition
   and dominance that don't depend on human intervention for its
   maintenance. Therefore these novel ecosystems ``exist as a
   non-regressive consequence of human activity{''}.
   In addressing the current manifestations of novel ecosystems, we adopt
   the retrospective method of historical geography, taking the landscape
   not only as a means but also as an end; more than mere instrument of
   knowledge, it is the object of knowledge. In this case, we visit the
   past only to fetch the explanatory elements of the present. Adopting
   this strategy, we proceed in the same way that natural scientists
   working in the evolutionary field (geologists, paleontologists, etc.):
   performing a ``remote sensing of processes through surviving
   structures{''}. More specifically, we use present residual structures
   (e.g. novel ecosystems) to reconstruct the past processes of landscape
   transformation. In this article, we aim to reconstruct the processes
   that produced two of the largest urban forests of today's world, both
   located in granite-gneiss massifs of Rio de Janeiro city, southeastern
   Brazil: Tijuca Massif and Pedra Branca Massif, both comprising,
   respectively, a National Park and a State Park.
   Currently, these two forest areas have particular ecological
   characteristics. Hiking on the slopes of Tijuca, it is easy to find
   whole tracts dominated by the exotic jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus
   Lam.), which had been originally introduced in those slopes in the
   mid-nineteenth century, when a reforestation project began to reclaim
   the lands degraded by coffee plantation and timber extraction. More
   hardly noticeable are the small plateaus of blackened soil, evidence of
   an ancient industry, essential to the past urban economy: charcoal
   manufacture. The residues of this activity, however, are much more
   common in the west, in Pedra Branca. There, one of the authors has
   discovered, through archaeological work, over a thousand old charcoal
   kilns with a local influence in species composition and dominance. To
   notice the conspicuous presence of the banana (Musa paradisiaca L.),
   however, one needs no digging. Planted decades ago in any place
   accessible by a mule - on the backs of which the succulent and
   nutritious fruits traveled to less rugged terrain, where they were
   collected by trucks - many of these herbs-that-want-to-be-trees remain
   in the landscape after being abandoned by their growers, generating
   hybrid banana-forest systems.
   These are examples of how human societies as they spatialize themselves
   - a necessary condition of their existence in time -, leave behind the
   clues to their own historical intelligibility. However, this dynamic of
   social reproduction and understanding would never be possible if only
   humans were involved. Human beings and their societies emerge as such
   only in an open and dynamic relationship with what is non-human - other
   animals, plants, minerals etc., and their particular ways of being. In
   other words, these are more-than-human social regimes whose development
   is dependent on both human agency and earth systems. Thus, the emerging
   ecosystem approach constitutes a new way of ``reading{''} the landscape,
   one that weaves together the human and non-human worlds into a coherent
   environmental history of the present social-ecological system.},
