Abstract = {In this paper, we summarize the contributions made by an
   interdisciplinary group of researchers from different disciplines
   (biology, ecology, economics, and law) that deal with key dimensions of
   marine social-ecological systems. Particularly, the local and global
   seafood provision; the feasibility and management of marine protected
   areas; the use of marine ecosystem services; the institutional dimension
   in European fisheries, and the affordable models for providing
   scientific advice to small-scale fisheries. This Special Issue presents
   key findings from selected case studies around the world available to
   educators, policy makers, and the technical community. Together, these
   papers show that a range of diverse ecological, economic, social, and
   institutional components often mutually interact at spatial and temporal
   scales, which evidence that managing marine social-ecological systems
   needs a continuous adaptability to navigate into new governance systems.},

Title = {Interactions Between Spatially Explicit Conservation and Management

Abstract = {Marine protected areas are not established in an institutional and
   governance vacuum and managers should pay attention to the wider
   social-ecological system in which they are immersed. This article
   examines Islas Choros-Damas Marine Reserve, a small marine protected
   area located in a highly productive and biologically diverse coastal
   marine ecosystem in northern Chile, and the interactions between human,
   institutional, and ecological dimensions beyond those existing within
   its boundaries. Through documents analysis, surveys, and interviews, we
   described marine reserve implementation (governing system) and the
   social and natural ecosystem-to-be-governed. We analyzed the
   interactions and the connections between the marine reserve and other
   spatially explicit conservation and/or management measures existing in
   the area and influencing management outcomes and governance. A top-down
   approach with poor stakeholder involvement characterized the
   implementation process. The marine reserve is highly connected with
   other spatially explicit measures and with a wider social-ecological
   system through various ecological processes and socio-economic
   interactions. Current institutional interactions with positive effects
   on the management and governance are scarce, although several potential
   interactions may be developed. For the study area, any management action
   must recognize interferences from outside conditions and consider some
   of them (e.g., ecotourism management) as cross-cutting actions for the
   entire social-ecological system. We consider that institutional
   interactions and the development of social networks are opportunities to
   any collective effort aiming to improve governance of Islas Choros-Damas
   marine reserve. Communication of connections and interactions between
   marine protected areas and the wider social-ecological system (as
   described in this study) is proposed as a strategy to improve
   stakeholder participation in Chilean marine protected areas.},

Abstract = {Climate and ecological emergencies play out acutely in coastal systems
   with devastating impacts on biodiversity, and the livelihoods of
   communities and their cultural values. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are
   one of the key management and regulatory tools against biodiversity
   loss, playing a role in strengthening bio-cultural diversity and
   sustainability of coastal social-ecological systems. What is unclear
   though is the effectiveness of static protections under climate change
   as species move. Next to ecological uncertainty, regulatory uncertainty
   may play a role in weakening marine conservation. We asked whether MPAs
   are ecologically effective now and can sustain or improve to be so in
   the future while facing key climate and regulatory uncertainties. MPAs
   can support the protection of cultural values and have an impact on
   activities of sea-users and the sustainability of social-ecological
   systems. As such, questions surrounding their legitimacy under a
   changing climate and increased uncertainty are pertinent. We argue that
   MPA governance must be cognisant of the interdependency between natural
   and human systems and their joint reaction to climate change impacts
   based on an integrated, co-developed, and interdisciplinary approach.
   Focusing on the UK as a case study, we highlight some of the challenges
   to achieve effective, adaptive and legitimate governance of MPAs.This
   article is part of the theme issue `Nurturing resilient marine
   ecosystems'.},

Abstract = {In view of current worldwide coral reef decline, and the shortcomings of
   traditional top-down management schemes of Marine Protected Areas
   (MPAs), decision makers and scientists face the important challenge of
   developing new approaches to generate effective conservation strategies.
   This study evaluates MPAs as linked social-ecological systems (SES) to
   inform better management by calculating indices for ecological health,
   social adaptive capacity, and the impact intensity of overfishing,
   pollution, and tourism. A series of ecological and socioeconomic
   indicators are used to estimate these indices and determine relevant
   conservation strategies in two protected areas in the Colombian
   Caribbean. Results reveal a precarious situation of high impact
   intensity combined with low ecological health and adaptive capacity.
   This study provides further evidence supporting the need for
   reconciliation of SES and a framework by which decision makers can
   assess priorities to increase MPA effectiveness. We highlight the need
   for system reorganization and recommend bottom-up comanagement schemes
   as a priority strategy to strengthen adaptive capacity.},

Abstract = {Environmental conservation initiatives, including marine protected areas
   (MPAs), have proliferated in recent decades. Designed to conserve marine
   biodiversity, many MPAs also seek to foster sustainable development. As
   is the case for many other environmental policies and programs, the
   impacts of MPAs are poorly understood. Social-ecological systems, impact
   evaluation, and common-pool resource governance are three complementary
   scientific frameworks for documenting and explaining the ecological and
   social impacts of conservation interventions. We review key components
   of these three frameworks and their implications for the study of
   conservation policy, program, and project outcomes. Using MPAs as an
   illustrative example, we then draw upon these three frameworks to
   describe an integrated approach for rigorous empirical documentation and
   causal explanation of conservation impacts. This integrated
   three-framework approach for impact evaluation of governance in
   social-ecological systems (3FIGS) accounts for alternative explanations,
   builds upon and advances social theory, and provides novel policy
   insights in ways that no single approach affords. Despite the inherent
   complexity of social-ecological systems and the difficulty of causal
   inference, the 3FIGS approach can dramatically advance our understanding
   of, and the evidentiary basis for, effective MPAs and other conservation
   initiatives.},

Abstract = {Collaborative management arrangements are increasingly being used in
   fisheries, yet critical questions remain about the conditions under
   which these are most successful. Here, we conduct one of the first
   comprehensive tests of Elinor Ostrom's diagnostic framework for
   analyzing social-ecological systems to examine how 16 socioeconomic and
   institutional conditions are related the livelihood outcomes in 42
   co-management arrangements in five countries across the Indo-Pacific. We
   combine recent developments in both theory and modeling to address three
   key challenges among comparative studies of social-ecological systems:
   the presence of a large number of explanatory mechanisms, variables
   operating at multiple scales, and the potential for interactions among
   socio-economic and institutional factors. We find that resource users
   were more likely to perceive benefits from co-management when they are
   more involved in decisions, were aware that humans are causal agents of
   change in marine systems, were wealthier, were not migrants, were in
   villages with smaller populations and older co-management arrangements,
   and had clearly established boundaries. Critically, we quantify a number
   of key interactions between: wealth, dependence on marine resources,
   involvement in decision-making, and population size that have strong
   implications for co-management success in terms of livelihood benefits.
   This study demonstrates that context plays a critical but identifiable
   role in co-management success. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   comprehensive understanding of SES; (ii) helps manage complexity as a
   system; and (iii) allows researchers to identify the feedback structures
   driving human-environment interactions that may perpetuate ecosystem
   decline. These benefits represent a valuable starting point for more

Title = {Seeing Through Fishers' Lenses: Exploring Marine Ecological Changes
   Within Mafia Island Marine Park, Tanzania},
Journal = {SAGE OPEN},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Insights from traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of the marine
   environment are difficult to integrate into conventional science
   knowledge (CSK) initiatives. Where TEK is integrated into CSK at all, it
   is usually either marginalized or restricted to CSK modes of
   interpretation, hence limiting its potential contribution to the
   understanding of social-ecological systems. This study uses
   semi-directive interviews, direct observations, and structured
   open-ended questionnaires (n = 103) to explore TEK of marine ecological
   changes occurring within the Mafia Island Marine Park, Tanzania, and
   factors contributing to these changes. It illuminates TEK insights that
   can be valuable in parallel with CSK to provide a more nuanced
   understanding of ecological changes. In some areas, fishers observed
   coral reef growth, increased fish abundance, and increased sea
   temperatures, whereas in others, they reported decreases in sea level,
   coral cover, fish abundance, catch composition, catch quantities, and
   fish size. They associated these changes with interrelated factors
   emanating from environmental processes, conservation outcomes, marketing
   constraints, population dynamics, and disappearance of cultural
   traditions. Utilizing TEK without restricting it to CSK modes of
   interpretation has the potential to improve CSK initiatives by promoting
   complementarity and mutual enrichment between the two kinds of
   knowledge, thereby contributing new insights that may enhance adaptive
   management and resilience in social-ecological systems.},

Title = {Unintended consequences of sustainable development initiatives: risks
   and opportunities in seagrass social-ecological systems},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Conserving biodiversity with a growing human population is a key
   sustainability challenge. Consequently, a vast number of development
   initiatives across the globe have been designed to combine social,
   economic, and environmental perspectives. For the most part, the
   development community is well acquainted with the negative experiences
   and unintended consequences that some projects have or may bring.
   However, in tropical coastal ecosystems, this aspect is not completely
   acknowledged, studied, or understood. Here, we use tropical seagrass
   meadows as a model social-ecological system to investigate how
   sustainable development initiatives result in unintended consequences
   with both positive and negative outcomes for environment and society. We
   analyze the initiatives and their effects in terms of a typology
   encompassing ???flow???, ???addition???, and ???deletion??? effects and
   investigate them across four types of sustainable development
   initiatives that occur within tropical coastal environments: (1)
   megafauna conservation, (2) alternative livelihood programs, (3)
   mosquito net malaria prophylaxis, and (4) marine protected areas. Using
   these four initiatives as examples, we show that sustainable development
   initiatives can produce unintended effects with major consequences.
   Further, we illustrate how not assessing such effects may ultimately
   undermine the initial goals of the sustainable development intervention.
   Our study suggests that acknowledging unintended effects and
   transitioning them so that they become sustainable is more effective
   than ignoring effects or viewing them as trade-offs. We strongly stress
   the need for an a priori process in which positive effects, negative
   effects, and potential uncertainties and surprises are considered when
   planning the development intervention, and we argue for greater
   social-ecological monitoring of initiatives. As such, this contribution
   links to contemporary approaches dealing with the sustainability of
   natural resources and social-ecological systems and bridges with the
   importance of development initiatives in the context of the United
   Nations Sustainable Development Goals.},

Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 14},
Abstract = {The framework proposed by Ostrom (2009) has become one of the most
   utilized tools to address the complexity of social-ecological systems.
   Most cases use this framework to analyze the systems from the
   perspective of a single resource unit. However, the livelihoods in
   several coastal communities are diverse, so that the users interact with
   multiple common-pool resources, which makes their analysis difficult. In
   this sense, it is important to identify the key elements of management
   to achieve the sustainable use of the resources. In this study, we were
   able to do this in a coastal community where commercial fishing,
   ecotourism, and recreational fishing coexist. The system of interest,
   located in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico, was subdivided by resource
   type using a multi-method approach to data collection including surveys,
   interviews, and records review. A conceptual map was developed that
   shows how the second-tier variables are integrated through the
   governance and actors with the biophysical system. The actors involved
   in lobster fishing achieved a more complex governance system, followed
   by the ecotourism and recreational fishing; the complexity of the
   governance was related with the equity level of the actors. The analysis
   revealed the research gaps to develop management strategies and improve
   the sustainability of the system.},

Title = {Marine protected areas overall success evaluation (MOSE): A novel
   integrated framework for assessing management performance and
   social-ecological benefits of MPAs},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {198},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Characterized by interlinked social, economic, and ecological dynamics,
   Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are a management tool for achieving
   sustainability goals in social-ecological systems. The recent increase
   in their establishment worldwide, fostered by international policies,
   highlights the need for comprehensive and integrated assessment
   frameworks able to address the evaluation of their social-ecological
   effectiveness and management performance, which is of fundamental
   importance for their adaptive management and decision making processes.
   Although several indicators and methodologies exist to assess MPAs
   ecological or social performances, no comprehensive assessment framework
   currently captures their broad range of objectives, encompassing the
   ecological, socio-cultural, and economic spheres. In this study, we
   present a novel quantitative framework (named MPAs Overall Success
   Evaluation - MOSE) able to assess the overall effectiveness and
   management performance of MPAs under the perspective of
   social-ecological systems. The multicriteria framework includes
   indicators linked to nature conservation, socio-cultural,
   socio-economic, and management objectives, integrating the
   multidisciplinary knowledge on MPAs in a single but comprehensive
   approach. The proposed framework was applied to the case study of
   Cerbere-Banyuls Natural Marine Reserve (France), the first MPA included
   in the IUCN Green List. Results showed that a high level of management
   effort is applied to the investigated MPA, generating several
   social-ecological benefits. This study showed the applicability of the
   MOSE framework and its potential usefulness as a tool to inform managers
   and decision-makers in charge for developing adaptive management
   strategies.},

Title = {Investigating Causal Pathways Linking Site-Level Characteristics,
   Compliance, and Ecological Performance in Caribbean MPAs},
Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {43},
Number = {3},
Pages = {329-341},
Abstract = {A rapidly growing body of empirical evidence has linked improved
   ecological performance of social-ecological systems (SES) with better
   compliance with rules governing human activities. Researchers have
   proposed several key factors that motivate an individual to comply with
   resource use rules, including deterrence, social pressures, moral
   inclinations, and perceived legitimacy of rules and responsible
   authorities. Much of the research on compliance proposes causal
   mechanisms at the individual human level, but few studies test causal
   paths with empirical data particularly at the site level. This study
   tested a proposed pathway for explaining overall compliance rates and
   ecological performance in SES using data from structured surveys of
   community members, key informant interviews, policy documents, and coral
   reef surveys at marine protected areas (MPAs) and their associated human

   and other active MPA management interventions positively affect

   influence significant predictors of overall compliance rates, which
   include active MPA management and enforced punishments.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem-based Fisheries Management is a holistic management approach
   that integrates the dynamics of an entire ecosystem, including societal
   dimensions. However, this approach seldom lives up to its promise
   because economic and social objectives are rarely specified. To fill
   this gap, we explored how an ecosystem model could better integrate
   economic and social objectives, using the coral reef ecosystem around
   Hawai`i as a case study. After meeting with stakeholders and conducting
   a literature review of policy/strategy documents, we identified societal
   and ecological objectives and associated performance indicators for
   which data existed. We developed a social-ecological system conceptual
   framework to illustrate the relationships between ecological and social
   state components. This framework was the foundation for the development
   of the final social-ecological system model which we simulated using an
   Ecopath with Ecosim model. We simulated four gear/species restrictions
   for the reef-based fishery, two fishing scenarios associated with the
   opening of hypothetical no-take Marine Protected Areas for the
   deepwater-based fishery, and a Constant Effort (No Action) scenario.
   Despite limitations in the model, our approach shows that when social
   and economic objectives and social-ecological relationships are defined,
   we can quantify the trade-offs among the identified societal objectives
   to support managers in choosing among alternative interventions.},

Title = {Public perception of an important urban estuary: Values, attitudes, and
   policy support in the Biscayne Bay-Miami Social Ecological System},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {Understanding public perceptions, values, and preferences can be
   fundamental to effective conservation governance, management, and
   outreach. This is particularly true in socially and ecologically complex
   marine and coastal spaces, where many relevant questions remain. The
   social-ecological system of Biscayne Bay and Miami-Dade are on the
   frontier of problems that will soon engulf many coastal-urban systems.
   Despite the economic, ecological, and cultural importance of Biscayne
   Bay, research into the social components of this social-ecological
   system is distinctly lacking. In order to effectively address urgent
   coastal management issues, practitioners and policy-makers need a clear
   understanding of public perceptions, values, and priorities. In this
   paper I present the results of a large online survey (n = 1146)
   exploring public attitudes toward Biscayne Bay as a case study of
   management and opportunity in a complex coastal social-ecological
   system. Results describe a public that interacts with and utilizes
   Biscayne Bay in a variety of ways, from leisure and recreation, to
   subsistence. This public believes the Bay to be moderately healthy,
   though somewhat in decline, and has experienced a range of local
   environmental threats, about which they feel considerable concern. These
   interactions and concerns are in turn reflected in overwhelming
   endorsement of value statements regarding the ecological, material,
   cultural and economic importance of the ecosystem to the city, as well
   as high levels of support for policy actions to protect and restore that
   ecosystem. Together these findings indicate that additional policy steps
   to preserve and restore Biscayne Bay would enjoy support from the local
   public and demonstrate the power of public perceptions research to
   identify gaps and opportunities for management and outreach.},

Title = {General rules for environmental management to prioritise social
   ecological systems research based on a value of information approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {56},
Number = {8},
Pages = {2079-2090},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Globally, billions of dollars are invested each year to help understand
   the dynamics of social ecological systems (SES) in bettering both social
   and environmental outcomes. However, there is no scientific consensus on
   which aspect of an SES is most important and urgent to understand;
   particularly given the realities of limited time and money. Here we use
   a simulation-based ``value of information{''} approach to examine where
   research will deliver the most important information for environmental
   management in four SESs representing a range of real-life environmental
   issues. We find that neither social nor ecological information is
   consistently the most important: instead, researchers should focus on
   understanding the primary effects of their management actions. Thus,
   when managers are undertaking social actions the highest research
   priority should be understanding the dynamics of social groups.
   Alternatively, when manipulating ecological systems it will be most
   important to quantify ecological population dynamics. Synthesis and
   applications. Our results provide a standard assessment to determine the
   uncertain social ecological systems (SES) component with the highest
   expected impact for management outcomes. First, managers should
   determine the structure of their SES by identifying social and
   ecological nodes. Second, managers should identify the qualitative
   nature of the network, by determining which nodes are linked, but not
   the strength of those interactions. Finally, managers should identify
   the actions available to them to intervene in the SES. From these steps,
   managers will be able to identify the SES components that are closest to
   the management action(s), and it is these nodes and interactions that
   should receive priority research attention to achieve effective
   environmental decision making.},

Journal = {ECOSYSTEMS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Pages = {649-664},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The concept of spatial resilience has brought a new focus on the
   influence of multi-scale processes on the dynamics of ecosystems.
   Initial ideas about spatial resilience focused on coral reefs and
   emphasized escalating anthropogenic disturbances across the broader
   seascape. This perspective resonated with a new awareness of global
   drivers of change, such as growth in international trade and shifts in
   climate, and the need to respond by scaling up governance and
   management. We review recent trends and emerging ideas in spatial
   resilience, using coral reefs and dependent communities as exemplars of
   multi-scale social-ecological systems. Despite recent advances,
   management and governance of ecosystems remain spatially fragmented and
   constrained to small scales. Temporally, many interventions still miss
   or ignore warning signals and struggle to cope with history, politics,
   long-term cumulative pressures, feedbacks, and sudden surprises.
   Significant recent progress has been made in understanding the relevance
   of spatial and temporal scale, heterogeneity, networks, the importance
   of place, and multi-scale governance. Emerging themes include better
   integration of ecology and conservation with social and economic
   science, and incorporating temporal dynamics in spatial analyses. A
   better understanding of the multi-scale spatial and temporal processes
   that drive the resilience of linked social-ecosystems will help address
   the widespread mismatch between the scales of ongoing ecological change
   and effective long-term governance of land- and seascapes.},

Title = {Scalar capital as ingredient of success in conservation governance:
   evidence from Melanesia},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {62},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Problems of scale abound in the governance of complex social-ecological
   systems. Conservation governance, for example, typically occurs at a
   single scale, but needs to inform governance and action at other scales
   to be truly effective at achieving social and ecological outcomes. This
   process is conventionally conceived as unidirectional - either scaling
   down or scaling up - in the way it both exploits and creates the
   natural, social, human, institutional, and financial resources and
   benefits that are collectively known as conservation `capital'. Here we
   analyse multiscale conservation governance and the different types of
   capital that impede or facilitate its effectiveness. Comparative
   analysis of conservation planning in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon
   Islands, through in-depth document review, key informant interview, and
   participant observation, reveals limited evidence of unidirectional
   processes. Instead, we observe multidirectional scaling pathways,
   cultivated by the following six scale-explicit characteristics of
   effective conservation governance: 1) multiscale understanding, 2) scale
   jumping, 3) scaled leadership characteristics, 4) scaled stakeholder
   engagement, 5) scaled policy frameworks, and 6) scaled institutional
   settings. While the latter four are familiar concepts, though not always
   recognised as explicitly scalar, we know little about the first two
   attributes of conservation governance. Based on this novelty and
   relevance, we propose a new form of capital - `scalar capital' - to
   complement natural, social, human, institutional, and financial capitals
   as both input and outcome of effective conservation governance. We find
   that scalar capital facilitates flows of different resources (data,
   conservation objectives, practitioner experience, institutional support,
   and funding) in multiple directions. Critically, we present empirical
   evidence that conservation governance can foster scalar capital to
   improve outcomes across multiple scales.},

Title = {Social and ecological effectiveness of large marine protected areas},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {43},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Large marine protected areas are increasingly being established to meet
   global conservation targets and promote sustainable use of resources.
   Although the factors affecting the performance of small-scale marine
   protected areas are relatively well studied, there is no such body of
   knowledge for large marine protected areas. We conducted a global
   meta-analysis to systematically investigate social, ecological, and
   governance characteristics of successful large marine protected areas
   with respect to several social and ecological outcomes. We included all
   large (>10,000 km(2)), implemented (>5 years of active management)
   marine protected areas that had sufficient data for analysis, for a
   total of twelve cases. We used the Social Ecological Systems
   Meta-Analysis Database, and a consistent protocol for using secondary
   data and key informant interviews, to code proxies for fisheries,
   ecosystem health, and the wellbeing of user groups (mainly fishers). We
   tested four sets of hypotheses derived from the literature on
   small-scale marine protected areas and common-pool resources: (i) the
   attributes of species and ecosystems to be managed in the marine
   protected area, (ii) adherence to principles for designing small-scale
   marine protected areas, (iii) adherence to the design principles for
   common-pool resource management, and (iv) stakeholder participation. We
   found varying levels of support for these hypotheses. Improved fisheries
   were associated with older marine protected areas, and higher levels of
   enforcement. Declining fisheries were associated with several ecological
   and economic factors, including low productivity, high mobility, and
   high market value. High levels of participation were correlated with
   improvements in wellbeing and ecosystem health trends. Overall, this
   study constitutes an important first step in identifying factors
   affecting social wellbeing and ecological performance of large marine
   protected areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Trust, confidence, and equity affect the legitimacy of natural resource
   governance},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Social-ecological systems are often highly complex, making effective
   governance a considerable challenge. In large, heterogeneous systems,
   hierarchical institutional regimes may be efficient, but effective
   management outcomes are dependent on stakeholder support. This support
   is shaped by perceptions of legitimacy, which risks being undermined
   where resource users are not engaged in decision-making. Although
   legitimacy is demonstrably critical for effective governance, less is
   known about the factors contributing to stakeholders' perceptions of
   legitimacy or how these perceptions are socially differentiated. We
   quantitatively assessed stakeholder perceptions of legitimacy (indicated
   by support for rules) and their contributory factors among 307
   commercial fishers and tourism operators in Australia's Great Barrier
   Reef Marine Park. Legitimacy was most strongly associated with trust in
   information from governing bodies, followed by confidence in
   institutional performance and the equity of management outcomes.
   Legitimacy differed both within and among resource user groups, which
   emphasizes the heterogeneous nature of commonly defined stakeholder
   groups. Overall, tourism operators perceived higher legitimacy than did
   commercial fishers, which was associated with higher trust in
   information from management agencies. For fishers, higher levels of
   trust were associated with: (1) engagement in fisheries that had high
   subsector cohesion and positive previous experiences of interactions
   with governing bodies; (2) location in areas with greater proximity to
   sources of knowledge, resources, and decision-making; and (3) engagement
   in a Reef Guardian program. These findings highlight the necessity of
   strategies and processes to build trust among all user groups in large
   social-ecological systems such as the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.
   Furthermore, the social differentiation of perceptions that were
   observed within user groups underscores the importance of targeted
   strategies to engage groups that may not be heard through traditional
   governance channels.},

Title = {The evolution of marine protected area planning in Aotearoa New Zealand:
   Reflections on participation and process},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {113-127},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a critical element of fisheries
   management and biodiversity conservation strategies. However, MPA
   planning is a complex undertaking that requires consideration of
   ecological and other knowledge, including indigenous knowledge, as well
   as balancing social, cultural, and economic interests. Engaging a range
   of stakeholders and indigenous partners in MPA planning, establishment,
   and management has consistently been identified as key to successful MPA
   implementation. This paper interrogates MPA planning in Aotearoa New
   Zealand, with a focus on the role of participation and collaboration in
   the development and implementation of MPAs. Previous and current MPA
   processes were evaluated using best practice principles drawn from
   international MPA and other participatory process literature. Several
   factors hypothesised to be associated with improvements and efficiencies
   in the involvement of participants in MPA decision making are assessed,
   including aspects of participation, best available information, social
   learning and capacity, fair and respective process, and efficiency of
   administration. Processes were compared before and after introduction of
   the New Zealand Marine Protected Areas Policy and Implementation Plan in
   2005. Areas for improvement in future evolutions of MPA planning also
   emerged from this research; these centre primarily on the need for
   inclusive and balanced participation; inclusion of multiple values and
   information types in MPA decision making; time to build trust and
   establish shared understanding; and resourcing. These recommendations
   represent a conceptualisation of MPAs operating within holistic
   social-ecological systems frameworks that encompass more than
   biodiversity conservation or extractive use, potentially redefining how
   MPAs are conceived of, developed, implemented and valued.},

Title = {Capacity building for tourism development in a nested social-ecological
   system-A case study of the South Penghu Archipelago Marine National
   Park, Taiwan},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {123},
Pages = {66-73},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In subnational small-island settings with a relatively undisturbed
   natural environment and an out migration population, tourism development
   is often used as an alternative development strategy for economic and
   social regeneration. When such tourism development entails place-based
   management, such as in a marine protected area (MPA), tourism
   development can also be used as a strategy for alleviating the conflict
   between conservation and development as well as for increasing community
   participation. Local support and capacity building prior to tourism
   development are essential for involving local communities. Local
   communities are often complex and heterogeneous, and tourism development
   must be tailored to match their diverse needs. In this case study, three
   communities within the South Penghu Archipelago, where a marine national
   park and development of the tourism industry has been proposed, were
   investigated. This study assessed the perception of tourism development
   among community actors and the demands for capacity building to cope
   with future changes by conducting a social ecological system (SES)
   analysis wherein the South Penghu MPA was considered a nested SES
   composed of subsystems. The subsystems focused on in this study were
   fishermen and nonfishermen at the functional scale and individual
   communities at the spatial scale. The results showed that the
   perceptions on tourism development varied substantially among the
   community actors and the different sub-SESs because of their different
   experiences in social ecological interactions. Therefore, tourism
   development in a regional place-based management, such as in a MPA, must
   consider the various perceptions of such subsystems on tourism
   development. Rather than considering all local communities as a general
   unit, capacity building should be tailored to the needs of the community
   actors from the various sub-SESs. In addition, support from governmental
   agencies is essential for the success of community-based MPA policies.

Abstract = {Protected areas (PAs) are critical for achieving conservation, economic
   and development goals, but the factors that lead households to engage in
   prohibited resource collection in PAs are not well understood. We
   examine collection behaviours in community forests and the protected
   Chitwan National Park in Chitwan, Nepal. Our approach incorporates
   household and ecological data, including structured interviews,
   spatially explicit data on collection behaviours measured with computer
   tablets and a systematic field survey of invasive species. We pair our
   data with a framework that considers factors related to a household's
   demand for resources, barriers to prohibited resource collection,
   barriers to legal resource collection and alternatives to resource
   collection. The analysis identifies key drivers of prohibited
   collection, including sociodemographic variables and perceptions of an
   invasive plant (Mikania micrantha). The social-ecological systems
   approach reveals that household perceptions of the presence of M.
   micrantha were more strongly associated with resource collection
   decisions than the actual ecologically measured presence of the plant.
   We explore the policy implications of our findings for PAs and propose
   that employing a social-ecological systems approach leads to
   conservation policy and scientific insights that are not possible to
   achieve with social or ecological approaches alone.},

Abstract = {There are few studies about how social-ecological context is linked to
   actor perceptions in environmental governance, although it is evident
   that resource use behavior, participatory processes, rule compliance,
   and cooperation are influenced by actors' perceptions. We apply and
   combine Ostrom's social-ecological systems framework (SESF) and
   Bennett's (2016) perception framework to identify the contextual
   variables influencing different perceptions in a case study of
   small-scale fisheries co-management in Costa Rica implementing a marine
   protected area. Analytically, we use network analysis tools to analyze
   qualitative interview data in a way that links the two frameworks, and
   content analysis to provide contexutally meaningful descriptions of
   those network patterns in practice. Our findings suggest Bennett's
   perceptions framework can be expanded and that the SESF is useful to
   identify how perceptions relate to more social and ecological variables
   than prior research suggests. Our findings demonstrate the importance of
   understanding perceptions and context in environmental governance
   analyses and practice. We conclude with reflections on local policy
   challenges.},

Title = {Achieving Success under Pressure in the Conservation of Intensely Used
   Coastal Areas},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Understanding how biological conservation and socioeconomic development
   can be harmonized in social-ecological systems is at the core of
   sustainability science. We present the case of a Mediterranean marine
   protected area (MPA), the Tavolara-Punta Coda Cavallo MPA, that exhibits
   high ecological performance under intense pressure from fishing,
   tourism, and coastal development. This case study illustrates how
   socioeconomic development and significant conservation benefits can
   coexist, even in a challenging context. Based on this case study, we
   present a framework for what elements and interactions have determined
   the high ecological performance of this MPA, and highlight the key
   leverages that have enabled ecosystem recovery. In particular, the most
   critical elements underlying high performance were sufficient leadership
   and knowledge to identify a conservation vision and to catalyze some key
   actors in the implementation of this vision. Thus, success was
   ultimately determined by the ability of the leadership of the MPA to
   devise and implement an effective strategy, with the support and
   participation of key actors that were external to the MPA organization.
   The insights from this case study may be applicable to improving MPA
   management in other systems with similar characteristics, including high
   human pressures and the presence of an MPA authority.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1475-1487},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Humans depend on earth's ecosystems and in the Anthropocene, ecosystems
   are increasingly impacted by human activities. Sustainability-the
   long-term integrity of social-ecological systems-depends on effective
   environmental stewardship, yet current conceptual frameworks often lack
   empirical validation and are limited in their ability to show progress
   towards sustainability goals. In this study we examine institutional and
   local stewardship actions and their ecological and social outcomes along
   7000 km of Australia's coastline. We use empirical mixed methods and
   grounded theory to show that the combination of local and institutional
   stewardship leads to improved ecological outcomes, which in turn enhance
   social values and motivate further stewardship to form a virtuous cycle.
   Virtuous cycles may proceed over multiple iterations, which we represent
   in a new spiral model enabling visualisation of progress towards
   sustainability goals over time. Our study has important implications for
   collaborative earth stewardship and the role of policy in enabling
   virtuous cycles to ultimately realise sustainable futures.},

Title = {Photovoice for mobilizing insights on human well-being in complex
   social-ecological systems: case studies from Kenya and South Africa},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {The value of diverse perspectives in social-ecological systems research
   and transdisciplinarity is well recognized. Human well-being and how it
   is derived from dynamic ecosystems is one area where local knowledge and
   perspectives are critical for designing interventions for sustainable
   pathways out of poverty. However, to realize the potential to enrich the
   understanding of complex dynamics for sustainability, there is a need
   for methods that engage holistic ways of perceiving human-nature
   interactions from multiple worldviews that also acknowledge inequalities
   between scientific and other forms of knowledge. To date, photovoice has
   been used to elicit local knowledge and perspectives about ecosystem
   changes and ecosystem services. We expand this to explore the utility of
   the method for facilitating the mobilization of plural insights on human
   well-being, which is subject to complex social-ecological dynamics, and
   its role in processes for coproduction of knowledge that acknowledges
   the need for equity and usefulness for all actors. Drawing on two cases,
   one in community-based marine protected areas in Kenya and one dealing
   with agricultural decline and rural-urban migration in South Africa, we
   demonstrate two modes of application of photovoice: as a scoping
   exercise and as a deep learning tool. The studies descriptively
   illustrate how photovoice can depict the hidden and often neglected
   intangible connections to ecosystems, plural and disaggregated
   perceptions of complex social-ecological dynamics, and issues of access
   and distribution of ecosystem benefits. The studies also show how
   photovoice can encourage equitable participation of nonacademic actors
   in research processes and in particular contribute to mobilization of
   knowledge and translation of knowledge across knowledge systems. We
   discuss how local perspectives may be further recognized and
   incorporated in transdisciplinary research and reflect on the practical
   and ethical challenges posed by using photographs in participatory
   research on social-ecological systems.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Climate change will pose new challenges to conserving Earth's natural
   ecosystems, due to incremental changes in temperature and weather
   patterns, and to increased frequency and intensity of extreme climate
   events. Addressing these challenges will require pragmatic conservation
   actions informed by site-specific understanding of susceptibility to
   climate change and capacity of societies to cope with and adapt to
   change. Depending on a location's environmental susceptibility and
   social adaptive capacity, appropriate conservation actions will require
   some combination of: (1) large-scale protection of ecosystems; (2)
   actively transforming and adapting social-ecological systems; (3)
   building the capacity of communities to cope with change; and (4)
   government assistance focused on de-coupling communities from dependence
   on natural resources. We apply a novel analytical framework to examine
   conservation actions in five western Indian Ocean countries, where
   climate-mediated disturbance has impacted coral reefs and where adaptive
   capacity differs markedly. We find that current conservation strategies
   do not reflect adaptive capacity and are, therefore, ill prepared for
   climate change. We provide a vision for conservation policies that
   considers social adaptive capacity that copes with complexities of
   climate change better than the singular emphasis on government control
   and the creation of no-take areas.},

   Park, Mexico, an insular marine protected area},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {46},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Islands are good models to conceptualize how ecosystem services are part
   of interactions in social-ecological systems. However, efforts have been
   insufficient to synthesize and integrate the accumulated knowledge of
   islands' ecosystem services. Holistic islands' ecosystem services
   assessments are key to achieve an effective translation of research into
   decision making, in contexts such as loss of biodiversity and climate
   change. Using a systematic review of 58 studies published from 1964 to
   2019, we identified associations between environments, habitats,
   ecosystem services, their components and beneficiaries in Islas Marietas
   National Park (IMNP), marine protected area and international tourist
   destination in western Mexico. Analysis of occurrence and data
   visualization were applied to synthesize the information. We identified
   12 ecosystem services, the most quantified services being migratory and
   nursery habitat for species, followed by gene pool protection,
   recreation and tourism in marine ecosystems, especially in coral reefs.
   The most quantified component was ``supply{''} for eight services. Main
   beneficiaries of knowledge of services were information brokers. We
   highlighted substantial knowledge gaps and identified constraints to
   advance knowledge of ecosystem services in IMNP. We proposed steps to
   incorporate the islands' ecosystem services into decision making, and
   visualized pathways for future social-ecological synthesis research in
   marine protected areas.},

Title = {Mangroves, fishers, and the struggle for adaptive comanagement: applying
   the social-ecological systems framework to a marine extractive reserve
   (RESEX) in Brazil},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Brazil has a network of marine extractive reserves (RESEX), a form of
   marine protected area (MPA) using comanagement. The RESEX program aims
   to bring traditionally marginalized populations with natural resource
   dependent livelihoods into national development processes by empowering
   them to participate in governance and steward biodiversity conservation.
   We apply the social-ecological systems framework (SESF) and collective
   action theory to diagnose challenges for comanagement in the
   Caete-Teperacu marine RESEX near Braganca, Brazil, a multiuse mangrove
   estuary supporting a small-scale crab fishery. We conducted key
   informant interviews and build on over 20 years of research in the
   region to provide an overarching analysis of the challenges facing
   comanagement. We describe the variables from the SESF in the case
   context and find that many social and ecological variables interact in
   clusters over time, and these clusters can be identified as themes,
   including (1) social and political momentum supporting the RESEX; (2)
   shifting perceptions of local residents and fishers; (3) patron-client
   relationships and social-ecological traps; (4) challenges with
   institutional fit; and (5) the interactions between harvesting closures,
   compensation, and dependence on local natural resources. Furthermore, we
   use collective action theory to help explain the role that each variable
   plays in either hindering or enabling successful governance. Our
   findings suggest that institutional resilience is needed to make RESEX
   adaptive to shifting social and political momenta. It could do this by
   providing more platforms for communication, deliberation, and knowledge
   exchange among the relevant actors. We believe our findings reflect
   broader challenges facing RESEX implementation throughout Brazil, and
   lessons can be learned for MPAs facing difficulties with the
   implementation of comanagement worldwide.},

Abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) worldwide are facing increasing driving
   forces, which represent a major and increasing challenge for MPA
   governance. The Marine Protected Area Governance (MPAG) project examined
   a range of different incentives - economic, interpretative, knowledge,
   legal and participative - employed to address the driving forces and
   promote effectiveness in 20 case studies across the globe. This paper
   argues that, regardless of the MPA governance approach adopted (i.e.,
   government-led, decentralised, private or community-led), resilience in
   MPA governance systems derives from employing a diversity of
   inter-connected incentives. The significance of institutional diversity
   to governance systems parallels that of species diversity to ecosystems,
   conferring resilience to the overall socio-ecological system. The paper
   concludes that, in the face of strong driving forces, rather than
   relying on particular types of incentives and institutions, it is
   important to recognise that the key to resilience is diversity, both of
   species in ecosystems and of institutions in governance systems. (C)

Title = {Contextualizing the social-ecological outcomes of coral reef fisheries
   management},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {241},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) have emerged as a valuable tool in
   biodiversity conservation and fisheries management. However, the
   effective use of MPAs depends upon the successful integration of social
   and ecological information. We investigated relationships between the
   social system structure of coastal communities alongside biological data
   describing the status and trends in fish communities around Yap,
   Micronesia. Traditional marine tenure made Yap an ideal place to
   investigate the underlying principles of social-ecological systems, as
   communities own and manage spatially-defined coastal resources. Analysis
   of social survey data revealed three social regimes, which were linked
   to corresponding gradients of ecological outcomes. Communities with
   decentralized decision-making and a preference for communal forms of
   fishing had the greatest ecological outcomes, while communities lacking
   any form of leadership were linked to poor ecological outcomes.
   Interestingly, communities with strong top-down leadership were shown to
   have variable ecological outcomes, depending on the presence of key
   groups or individuals. We last investigated whether social perception
   could successfully predict the status of fish assemblages within
   non-managed reefs. Several biological metrics of fish assemblages within
   non-managed areas were significantly predicted by a gradient of human
   access, suggesting social perception could not predict the growing human
   footprint over the study period. These findings highlight the
   potentially overlooked role that community-oriented decision-making
   structures and fishing methods could play in successful conservation
   efforts, and the limitations of perception data. Policies that promote
   communal marine resource use offer a novel approach to improve fisheries
   management and promote social-ecological resilience.},

Title = {Just Transformations to Sustainability},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {Transformations towards sustainability are needed to address many of the
   earth's profound environmental and social challenges. Yet, actions taken
   to deliberately shift social-ecological systems towards more sustainable
   trajectories can have substantial social impacts and exclude people from
   decision-making processes. The concept of just transformations makes
   explicit a need to consider social justice in the process of shifting
   towards sustainability. In this paper, we draw on the transformations,
   just transitions, and social justice literature to advance a pragmatic
   framing of just transformations that includes recognitional, procedural
   and distributional considerations. Decision-making processes to guide
   just transformations need to consider these three factors before, during
   and after the transformation period. We offer practical and
   methodological guidance to help navigate just transformations in
   environmental management and sustainability policies and practice. The
   framing of just transformations put forward here might be used to inform
   decision making in numerous marine and terrestrial ecosystems, in rural
   and urban environments, and at various scales from local to global. We
   argue that sustainability transformations cannot be considered a success
   unless social justice is a central concern.},

Abstract = {Lobster fishing is the main source of income for the people from the
   Juan Fernandez Archipelago (population ca. 770), located more than 700
   km off central Chile. An artisanal fishery has operated uninterruptedly
   for more than a century with few harvest controls (season, size, no
   egg-bearing females). Access to the resource has long been regulated by
   an informal but well structured traditional sea tenure system, which has
   effectively constrained the growth of fleet size. Nevertheless, and in
   spite of a lack of impending crises, assessments conducted over the last
   40 years have recurrently diagnosed that effort is well above the
   optimum level. On that basis, generic ``solutions{''} (quotas, marine
   protected areas, closures) have been prescribed with no attention to
   their possible impacts on the users and on traditional tenure
   arrangements. We discuss the merit of those diagnostics and
   prescriptions, and conclude that the disruption created by their
   eventual implementation would threaten the sustainability of the
   fishery. An analysis of the entire social-ecological system is needed
   before drastic solutions are prescribed. We investigate the factors that
   favor sustainability using Ostrom's framework for the analysis of
   social-ecological systems. Those factors have to do with the resource
   system (a productive stock with well defined boundaries and divisibility
   of fishing spots among users), governance (traditional tenure and simple
   operational rules), the users (few, strongly dependent on the resource,
   and sharing a detailed mental model of the resource system), and
   interactions (self-organization and partnerships). The resilience of the
   system was tested by the devastating tsunami that hit the islands in
   February 2010. This case study illustrates the need to attend to the
   interactions among resources, users and institutions in the search for
   effective solutions and to avoid disruptive management interventions.

Title = {The political economy of cross-scale networks in resource co-management},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We investigate linkages between stakeholders in resource management that
   occur at different spatial and institutional levels and identify the
   winners and losers in such interactions. So-called crossscale
   interactions emerge because of the benefits to individual stakeholder
   groups in undertaking them or the high costs of not undertaking them.
   Hence there are uneven gains from cross-scale interactions that are
   themselves an integral part of social-ecological system governance. The
   political economy framework outlined here suggests that the determinants
   of the emergence of cross-scale interactions are the exercise of
   relative power between stakeholders and their costs of accessing and
   creating linkages. Cross-scale interactions by powerful stakeholders
   have the potential to undermine trust in resource management
   arrangements. If government regulators, for example, mobilize
   information and resources from cross-level interactions to reinforce
   their authority, this often disempowers other stakeholders such as
   resource users. Offsetting such impacts, some cross-scale interactions
   can be empowering for local level user groups in creating social and
   political capital. These issues are illustrated with observations on
   resource management in a marine protected area in Tobago in the
   Caribbean. The case study demonstrates that the structure of the
   cross-scale interplay, in terms of relative winners and losers,
   determines its contribution to the resilience of social-ecological
   systems.},

Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {72},
Pages = {192-198},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a global conservation and management
   tool to enhance the resilience of linked social-ecological systems with
   the aim of conserving biodiversity and providing ecosystem services for
   sustainable use. However, MPAs implemented worldwide include a large
   variety of zoning and management schemes from single to multiple-zoning
   and from no-take to multiple-use areas. The current IUCN categorisation
   of MPAs is based on management objectives which many times have a
   significant mismatch to regulations causing a strong uncertainty when
   evaluating global MPAs effectiveness. A novel global classification
   system for MPAs based on regulations of uses as an alternative or
   complementing, the current IUCN system of categories is presented.
   Scores for uses weighted by their potential impact on biodiversity were
   built. Each zone within a MPA was scored and an MPA index integrates the
   zone scores. This system classifies MPAs as well as each MPA zone
   individually, is globally applicable and unambiguously discriminates the
   impacts of uses. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Institutional Change, Sustainability and the Sea},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {5},
Number = {12},
Pages = {5373-5390},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Currently, a substantial institutional change is under way for marine
   and coastal resources. Sustainability plays a major role therein. At the
   time of writing, roughly 2.3\% of the marine and coastal territory has
   been declared a Marine Protected Area (MPA). The Convention of
   Biological Diversity set a target to protect 10\% of the global marine
   environment by 2020. This move toward enclosure signifies a substantial
   shift away from mainly open access to at least de jure marine protected
   areas. What drives institutional change towards MPAs; and what role does
   sustainability play in this change in governance? In reflecting on these
   questions, the paper's aim is to begin a dialogue on how the
   social-ecological system (SES) analytical framework developed by Elinor
   Ostrom and her collaborators engages differentially with marine and
   coastal systems. How institutional change takes place depends on the
   characteristics of the resources considered and the drivers of change
   for the particular resource. In order to characterize the marine and
   coastal realm we use the social-ecological system (SES) framework of
   Elinor Ostrom. Douglas North's theory of institutional change is used to
   classify the change observed. The marine realm has ambiguous system
   boundaries and often high resource mobility. Uncertainties about system
   properties and change are much higher than for terrestrial systems.
   Interdependencies among different ecosystems are high, necessitating
   multi-level governance. Institutional change in this sector occurs under
   strong institutional path dependencies and competing ideologies. All
   these features make it particularly relevant to think about
   institutional change, sustainability and the current process of MPA
   expansion.},

Title = {Understanding divergent perspectives in marine governance in Kenya},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {33},
Number = {5},
Pages = {784-793},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {To understand the subtle institutional conditions that underlie marine
   governance, beyond broad conceptualisations of property rights or
   pre-defined institutional designs, it is necessary to situate governance
   structures and human interactions within their historical and current
   social and political context. A two-tiered stakeholder analysis was
   developed to facilitate this. This analytical tool illuminates divergent
   perspectives between actors in two marine social-ecological systems in
   Southern Kenya. Investigating these differences emphasises the variety
   of historical contexts, social geographies, and current power relations
   in which different groups are situated. These historical and contextual
   factors mediate how groups perceive and respond to governance. They,
   therefore, have important implications for how institutions function.

Title = {Marine Protected Areas: At the Crossroads of Nature Conservation and
   Fisheries Management},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 8},
Abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are designated parts of the ocean that
   restrict human activities to a certain degree. MPAs are established
   around the world using a wide range of legislative instruments and thus
   come in a variety of forms and shapes. Despite being regarded as the
   ``cornerstone{''} of global marine conservation efforts, they currently
   cover less than 10\% of the ocean surface. Individual MPAs aim to
   achieve goals ranging from the protection of specific habitats or
   species to sustaining certain commercial activities, such as fishing. By
   default, the establishment of MPAs intertwines social, ecological and
   economic considerations. Yet, the emphasis put on each of these domains
   can vary substantially when setting on-the-ground objectives, frequently
   creating conflict among stakeholders. In this manuscript, we first
   discuss current international conservation targets as well as potential
   future goals and delve into the question of how to assess the
   effectiveness of MPAs. Subsequently, we discuss the ambivalent role of
   this widely applied management tool at the crossroads between
   biodiversity conservation and fisheries management. Placing MPAs in a
   social-ecological framework, we call for clear and measurable goals to
   evaluate MPAs from an interdisciplinary perspective. Finally, we present
   the Baltic Sea, with its high degree of anthropogenic impact, long
   fishing history and comparatively extensive MPA coverage, as an
   interesting case study to investigate the role of MPAs in promoting a
   sustainable management of the ocean.},

Title = {Bridging for Better Conservation Fit in Indonesia's Coastal-Marine
   Systems},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Efforts to improve the fit between conservation initiatives (e.g.,
   marine protected areas, no-take zones) and the dynamic social dimensions
   of coastal-marine systems remain underdeveloped. We empirically
   illustrate here how opportunities to enhance ``conservation fit{''} are
   influenced by bridging organizations that serve to (1) better align
   conservation initiatives with characteristics of the social context that
   influence conservation outcomes (e.g., institutions, culture, values,
   local practice), (2) foster coordinated and adaptive approaches to
   conservation that are reflective of multiple perspectives and knowledge,
   and (3) better connect people and conservation actions across
   jurisdictional and geographical boundaries. Qualitative methods were
   used in this research, including semi-structured interviews, observation
   of key events and meetings, and literature review. We draw from three
   coastal-marine conservation cases in Bali, Indonesia, that exemplify
   different approaches to bridging for conservation fit: the Bali MPA
   Network, the Nusa Penida MPA, and the East Buleleng Conservation Zone.
   Our synthesis of these cases identifies different strategies used by
   bridging organizations to deal with conservation fit issues, including
   their capacity to integrate actors and perspectives using flexible
   approaches, actualize hybrid forms of decision-making, build capacity
   and leadership, and foster cross-scale conservation and scale-bridging
   social networks. We also examine the limitations of bridging
   organizations and offer direction for future research for coastal-marine
   conservation in Indonesia specifically, and the Coral Triangle region
   generally. More broadly, this analysis contributes new insights on
   emerging forms of governance designed to deliberatively fit conservation
   initiatives to coastal-marine social-ecological systems experiencing
   rapid change.},

Title = {Barriers and opportunities for social-ecological adaptation to climate
   change in coastal British Columbia},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {179},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Climate change poses novel and complex challenges to planning,
   management, and policies for marine and coastal social-ecological
   systems. Despite ongoing discussion of adopting interventions for
   improving adaptation and adaptive capacity to climate change,
   practitioners often continue to carry out conventional management
   strategies that do not effectively incorporate climate change impacts
   and projections. Using a web-based survey and semi-structured
   interviews, we explored the perceptions of practitioners (coastal
   managers and planners) in British Columbia, Canada relative to climate
   change risks, adaptation actions for social and ecological systems, and
   barriers for adaptation within the region. Overall, practitioners shared
   a concern that climate change is not currently well incorporated in
   management or policy in this region, and noted significant
   implementation gaps. Practitioners expressed more support for ecological
   adaptation actions that are well suited to regional implementation, such
   as incorporating climate change projections into management and reducing
   fisheries over-exploitation, than for actions such as protecting
   specific areas. Social adaptation actions were overall perceived as less
   useful than ecological adaptation actions, and actions that would
   support local management and monitoring efforts were viewed as more
   useful than developing alternative livelihoods. The main barriers and
   associated opportunities for climate change adaptation in marine
   management included political action, reducing scientific uncertainty,
   improving communication, and increasing capacity (both funding and
   staff). Additional opportunities include effective engagement with
   Indigenous governance, improving policies and funding for adaptation
   including monitoring, and focusing efforts on communication and
   education programs specific to practitioners and communities. This study
   demonstrates the necessity of collaboration across scales of management
   for effective climate change adaptation.},

Title = {Sustainable Cruise Tourism in Marine World Heritage Sites},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Cruise-ship tourism is one of the fastest growing industry sectors, with
   itineraries that regularly visit marine parks and protected areas.
   UNESCO Marine World Heritage (MWH) Sites feature some of the world's
   most exceptional ecosystems, resulting in some cruise lines targeting
   these sites. To understand the extent of cruise ship visitation and
   determine perceptions of cruise ship sustainability within and across
   environmental, economic, and sociocultural dimensions, we conducted an
   online survey of 45 (out of 50) sites. The survey included responses
   about the characteristics of cruise ship visitation, strategies for
   sustainably managing ships, and ideas for encouraging sustainable
   practices. Among the 45 respondents, 30 (67\%) indicated that their MWH
   site hosts cruise ships or cruise ship passengers, and 25 sites have
   cruise ships that enter the protected area marine waters. Most sites
   (62\%) indicated an increase in cruise visitation over the last three
   years. While most sites regulate ballast water (73\%) and wastewater
   (73\%) discharge, common concerns focused on ship air emissions and
   wildlife interactions. Lack of funds generated by cruise ships toward
   community infrastructure was noted. MWH site managers expressed interest
   in developing site networks to facilitate sharing of ideas as a first
   step for increasing sustainability across all sites.},

Abstract = {International interest in increasing marine protected area (MPA)
   coverage reflects broad recognition of the MPA as a key tool for marine
   ecosystems and fisheries management. Nevertheless, effective management
   remains a significant challenge. The present study contributes to
   enriching an understanding of best practices for MPA management through
   analysis of archived community survey data collected in the Philippines
   by the Learning Project (LP), a collaboration with United States Coral
   Triangle Initiative (USCTI), United States Agency for International
   Development (USAID), and partners. We evaluate stakeholder participation
   and social ecological interactions among resource users in MPA programs
   in the Palawan, Occidental Mindoro, and Batangas provinces in the
   Philippines. Analysis indicates that a complex suite of social
   ecological factors, including demographics, conservation beliefs, and
   scientifically correct knowledge influence participation, which in turn
   is related to perceived MPA performance. Findings indicate positive
   feedbacks within the system that have potential to strengthen
   perceptions of MPA success. The results of this evaluation provide
   empirical reinforcement to current inquiries concerning the role of
   participation in influencing MPA performance.},

Abstract = {Marine reserves are increasingly recognized as having linked social and
   ecological dynamics. This study investigates how the ecological
   performance of 56 marine reserves throughout the Philippines, Caribbean,
   and Western Indian Ocean (WIO) is related to both reserve design
   features and the socioeconomic characteristics in associated coastal
   communities. Ecological performance was measured as fish biomass in the
   reserve relative to nearby areas. Of the socioeconomic variables
   considered, human population density and compliance with reserve rules
   had the strongest effects on fish biomass, but the effects of these
   variables were region specific. Relationships between population density
   and the reserve effect on fish biomass were negative in the Caribbean,
   positive in the WIO, and not detectable in the Philippines. Differing
   associations between population density and reserve effectiveness defy
   simple explanation but may depend on human migration to effective
   reserves, depletion of fish stocks outside reserves, or other social
   factors that change with population density. Higher levels of compliance
   reported by resource users was related to higher fish biomass in
   reserves compared with outside, but this relationship was only
   statistically significant in the Caribbean. A heuristic model based on
   correlations between social, cultural, political, economic, and other
   contextual conditions in 127 marine reserves showed that high levels of
   compliance with reserve rules were related to complex social
   interactions rather than simply to enforcement of reserve rules.
   Comparative research of this type is important for uncovering the
   complexities surrounding human dimensions of marine reserves and
   improving reserve management.},

Title = {Space and time matter in social-ecological vulnerability assessments},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {213-221},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Fostering sustainable local social ecological interactions playing out
   against a backdrop of larger-scale dynamics are ubiquitous challenges to
   natural resource management and biodiversity conservation.
   Social-ecological vulnerability assessments are highly relevant for
   place-based management and can help target and prioritize management
   actions. However, an understanding of how linked social-ecological
   vulnerabilities respond to external drivers is still lacking. This paper
   presents an approach that integrates the spatial and temporal dimensions
   into social-ecological vulnerability assessments, where social and
   ecological vulnerabilities are linked by a feedback loop. The approach
   is applied to the Moorea coral reef social-ecological system, which has
   been significantly influenced by major environmental and social drivers
   over the last decade. Temporal changes in linked social-ecological
   vulnerabilities are mapped before and after exposure to the multiple
   drivers. Nearly 23\% of households and 13\% of the reef area show low
   and decreasing vulnerability despite exposure. However, high and
   increasing levels of vulnerability were detected in 6\% of households
   and associated reefs after exposure to the drivers, providing early
   warnings of potentially unsustainable situations. Importantly, changes
   in ecological vulnerability did not propagate linearly to changes in
   social vulnerability. Similarly, hot spots of social vulnerability were
   not necessarily associated with hot spots of ecological vulnerability,
   highlighting the need to specifically adapt management interventions to
   local social-ecological settings. Mapping social-ecological dependencies
   in space and time provides communities and decision-makers with the
   information required to identify and prioritize management interventions
   while accounting for the effects of large-scale or external drivers.},

Title = {Social-ecological dimensions of Marine Protected Areas and coastal
   fishing: How fishermen's local ecological knowledge can inform fisheries
   management at the future ``Taza{''} MPA (Algeria, SW Mediterranean)},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {221},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to examine fishermen's Local Ecological
   Knowledge (LEK) relating to Marine Protected Area (MPA) planning and the
   overlap with fisheries management in the future ``Taza{''} MPA (Algeria,
   SW Mediterranean). The case study focuses on both commercial and
   recreational coastal fisheries from the fishing harbour of Ziama (NE
   Algeria). In this area, coastal fishing is carried out by professional
   small-scale fishers and purse seiners for commercial fishery and by
   recreational boat fishers for recreational fishery. While there have
   been some science-based studies in the characterization of this coastal
   fishery by using direct observation of landings as a method for
   estimating catch and fishing effort, fishermen's LEK remains
   under-utilized in this Social-Ecological System (SES). To address this
   knowledge gap, perceptions regarding: (1) biological and ecological
   impacts of coastal fisheries, (2) marine ecosystem health and (3)
   attitudes towards the proposed MPA regulations were analyzed in order to
   assess potential social-ecological impacts which can inform more
   accurately on MPA planning and fisheries management in the future. To
   this end, thirty face-to-face semi-structured interviews with fishers at
   Ziama harbour were carried out between June and September 2017. The
   study found that the future establishment of the ``Taza{''} MPA may
   affect the fisheries in this area in the short-term, and in particular
   the jobs and livelihoods of professional fishers by limiting the fishing
   area through new fishing restrictions. The fishermen's LEK provided some
   capacity to understand the heterogeneity of the SES in place and may be
   used as a tool to evaluate the outcome of fishery management actions.
   The results indicate higher acceptance rates among recreational than
   professional fishers regarding no-take zones. Professional fishers were
   proportionately more likely to oppose the new regulations, though 53\%
   of the fishers surveyed were uncertain about the future positive impacts
   of the MPA. The LEK provides managers with a level of detail about the
   prediction and prevention of fishermen opposition, and can point out
   opportunities for improving conservation policy with respect to social
   acceptance.},

Abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly being promoted as an
   ocean-based climate solution. How-ever, such claims remain controversial
   because of the diffuse and poorly synthesized literature on climate
   benefits of MPAs. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a
   systematic literature review of 22,403 publications spanning 241 MPAs
   and analyzed these across 16 ecological and social pathways through
   which MPAs could contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation.
   Our meta-analysis demonstrates that marine conservation can
   significantly enhance carbon sequestration, coastal protection,
   biodiversity, and the reproductive capacity of marine organisms as well
   as fishers' catch and income. Most of these ben-efits are only achieved
   in fully or highly protected areas and increase with MPA age. Although
   MPAs alone cannot offset all climate change impacts, they are a useful
   tool for climate change mitigation and adaptation of social-ecological
   systems.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem-based management (EBM) is an emerging tool that considers
   humans as an integral part of the ecosystem (Arkema et al. 2006). EBM is
   different from other marine management tools (i.e., marine protected
   areas (MPAs), fishing regulations, quotas) because they typically deal
   with only one sector, resource, or impact. Primarily due to this, these
   strategies are not suitable because they fail to acknowledge the complex
   dynamics that affect social-ecological interactions. Instead, EBM
   attempts to embrace the complexity that drives the interactions between
   humans, their multiple impacts, and their environment (McLeod et al.
   2005; Tallis et al. 2010). EBM assesses how multiple sectors and
   cumulative impacts interact to affect the capacity of marine systems to
   deliver benefits to humans (Arkema et al. 2006; Ruckelshaus et al.
   2008). 1 The main goal of EBM is to build resilient social-ecological
   systems that can secure the long-term provision of ecosystem services
   and goods to humans (McLeod et al. 2005).},

Title = {Sustaining ecological and subsistence functions in conservation areas:
   eider habitat and access by Native hunters along landfast ice},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {45},

Pages = {361-369},

Abstract = {In the Arctic, rapid climate change has kindled efforts to delineate and
   project the future of important habitats for marine birds and mammals.
   These animals are vital to subsistence economies and cultures, so
   including the needs of both animals and hunters in conservation planning
   is key to sustaining social-ecological systems. In the northeast Chukchi
   Sea, a nearshore corridor of open water is a major spring migration
   route for half a million eider ducks that are hunted along the landfast
   ice. Zoning areas for industrial activities or conservation should
   consider both eider habitat and hunter access to those habitats from the
   variable ice edge. Based on benthic sampling in 2010-2012, a model of
   eider foraging energetics and satellite data on ice patterns in April
   and May 1997-2011, we mapped the range of positions of the landfast ice
   edge relative to a given dispersion of habitat suitable for eider
   feeding. In some sectors, feeding areas were too limited or too far from
   landfast ice to provide regular hunting access. In other sectors,
   overlap of the ice edge with eider feeding habitat was quite variable,
   but often within a consistent geographic range. Areas accessible to
   hunters were a small fraction of total eider habitat, so areas adequate
   for conserving eiders would not necessarily include areas that meet the
   hunters' needs. These results can inform spatial planning of industrial
   activities that yield cash income critical to subsistence hunting in
   less developed locations. Our study provides an approach for mapping
   subsistence conservation areas' throughout the Arctic and an example for
   such efforts elsewhere.},

   resource (CPR) management models developed by Ostrom. We analyze the
   origins and effectiveness of a community-based CPR system that has
   emerged despite several features that are, in Ostrom's view, barriers to
   local institutional development: the fish populations are migratory
   rather than stationary, spatial boundaries are ambiguous rather than
   fixed, and state support of local management is weak or non-existent
   rather than strong. We argue that cultural and political factors, which
   are given less emphasis in Ostrom's model, may help explain how these
   communities overcome barriers to collective action. We draw parallels
   between freshwater systems and Marine Protected Areas and discuss
   implications for local resource management.},

Abstract = {Meeting the objectives of sustainable fisheries management requires
   attention to the complex interactions between humans, institutions and
   ecosystems that give rise to fishery outcomes. Traditional approaches to
   studying fisheries often do not fully capture, nor focus on these
   complex interactions between people and ecosystems. Despite advances in
   the scope and scale of interactions encompassed by more holistic
   methods, for example ecosystem-based fisheries management approaches, no
   single method can adequately capture the complexity of human-nature
   interactions. Approaches that combine quantitative and qualitative
   analytical approaches are necessary to generate a deeper understanding
   of these interactions and illuminate pathways to address fisheries
   sustainability challenges. However, combining methods is inherently
   challenging and requires understanding multiple methods from different,
   often disciplinarily distinct origins, demanding reflexivity of the
   researchers involved. Social-ecological systems' research has a history
   of utilising combinations of methods across the social and ecological
   realms to account for spatial and temporal dynamics, uncertainty and
   feedbacks that are key components of fisheries. We describe several
   categories of analytical methods (statistical modelling, network
   analysis, dynamic modelling, qualitative analysis and controlled
   behavioural experiments) and highlight their applications in fisheries
   research, strengths and limitations, data needs and overall objectives.
   We then discuss important considerations of a methods portfolio
   development process, including reflexivity, epistemological and
   ontological concerns and illustrate these considerations via three case
   studies. We show that, by expanding their methods portfolios,
   researchers will be better equipped to study the complex interactions
   shaping fisheries and contribute to solutions for sustainable fisheries
   management.},

Title = {Assessing the Effectiveness of Coastal Marine Protected Area Management:
   Four Learned Lessons for Science Uptake and Upscaling},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {NOV 11},
Abstract = {For almost two decades, marine protected areas (MPAs) have been a
   central instrument of coastal conservation and management policies, but
   concerns about their abilities to meet conservation goals have grown as
   the number and sizes of MPAs have dramatically increased. This paper
   describes how a large (15 years) program of transdisciplinary research
   was used to successfully measure MPA management effectiveness (ME)-how
   well an MPA is managed, how well it is protecting values, and how well
   it is achieving the various goals and objectives for which it was
   created. This paper addresses the co-production and uptake of
   monitoring-based evidence for assessing ME in coastal MPAs by
   synthesizing the experiences of this program conducted with MPA
   managers. I present the main outcomes of the program, many were novel,
   and discuss four ingredients (learned lessons) that underpinned the
   successful uptake of science during and after the research program: (i)
   early and inclusive co-design of the project with MPA partners and
   scientists from all disciplines, (ii) co-construction of common
   references transcending the boundaries of disciplines, and standardized
   methodologies and tools, (iii) focus on outcomes that are
   management-oriented and understandable by end-users, and (iv) ensuring
   that capacity building and dissemination activities occurred during and
   persisted beyond the program. Standardized monitoring protocols and data
   management procedures, a user-friendly interface for indicator analysis,
   and dashboards of indicators related to biodiversity, uses, and
   governance, were the most valued practical outcomes. Seventy-five
   students were trained during the projects and most of the monitoring
   work was conducted with MPA rangers. Such outcomes were made possible by
   the extended timeline offered by the three successive projects. MPA
   managers' and scientists a posteriori perceptions strongly supported the
   relevance of such collaboration. Local monitoring and assessment meets
   the needs of MPA managers, and forms the basis for large-scale

Title = {Exploring the development of scientific research on Marine Protected
   Areas: From conservation to global ocean sustainability},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {61},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are playing a central role in the
   achievement of ocean sustainability and, since 2000, their global
   coverage has increased over ten times. The success of MPAs, and
   therefore the delivery of their potential outcomes for human well-being
   and global sustainability, requires multi-disciplinary, holistic, and
   comprehensive approaches for its achievement. In this study, the global
   scientific literature on MPAs was quantitatively reviewed through
   bibliometrics approaches, investigating patterns and trends in its
   development over time. In particular, bibliometric network and citation
   burst analyses of keywords were performed using VOSviewer and CiteSpace
   software. The bibliographic search on the Scopus and Web of Science
   databases resulted in a total number of 5908 and 6036 scientific
   documents published on MPAs. The network analysis of the keywords
   co-occurrence produced four main clusters whose connections and
   overlapping showed a multidisciplinary structure of MPA science, in
   which the ecological, social, and economic domains of research are
   strongly interlinked. Temporal analyses showed a recent focus on topics
   related to the social-ecological systems theory (e.g., ecosystem
   services, marine spatial planning, governance, and small-scale
   fisheries) suggesting that newer research lines recognize the importance
   of integrating the ?human dimension? in conservation and sustainability
   studies. Overall, the results of both the performed bibliometric
   analyses pointed out the evolution of MPA science from the conventional
   concept of ?marine reserves? to a broader scope integrating ecological,
   economic, and social aspects. In conclusion, MPA research is timely
   responding to the identification of MPAs as ocean sustainability tools,
   opening MPA science to multi-disciplinary research lines by linking the
   ecological and socio-economic dimensions of sustainability. MPA research
   is expected to play a crucial role in generating the interdisciplinary
   scientific knowledge needed to fully contribute to global ocean
   sustainability and human wellbeing.},

Abstract = {Based on research conducted by myself and colleagues as part of the
   Southern Cape Interdisciplinary Fisheries Research Project, I present an
   overview of residents' perspectives on the Stilbaai Marine Protected
   Area, located on the Southern Cape coast of South Africa. Currently,
   South Africa's marine governance sector is often fraught with
   politicking, inefficiencies, and other effects that strain the
   social-ecological system. This research shows that despite some
   fragmentation of governance, there are opportunities, and a general
   willingness, to engage in activities that take care of the local
   environment on the behalf of residents, that serve to educate about
   ocean-positive behaviours and engage visitors more meaningfully on the
   benefits and value of the Stilbaai Marine Protected Area. Problems that
   residents perceive to be associated with the Marine Protected Area are
   noted, and suggestions are made to enhance a sense of caretaking, or
   sorgskap, within the community to fill the gaps of certain governance or
   regulation inadequacies. Indeed, I argue that in lieu of efficient
   formal governance structures and collaborations, it is the informal
   characteristic of caretaking activities by the community that renders
   these activities more sustainable, long term, and effective in building
   a ``culture{''} of caretaking.},

Title = {Interplay of multiple goods, ecosystem services, and property rights in
   large social-ecological marine protected areas},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Protected areas are a cornerstone of biodiversity conservation, and
   increasingly, conservation science is integrating ecological and social
   considerations in park management. Indeed, both social and ecological
   factors need to be considered to understand processes that lead to
   changes in environmental conditions. Here, we use a social-ecological
   systems lens to examine changes in governance through time in an
   extensive regional protected area network, the Great Barrier Reef Marine
   Park. We studied the peer-reviewed and nonpeer-reviewed literature to
   develop an understanding of governance of the Great Barrier Reef Marine
   Park and its management changes through time. In particular, we examined
   how interacting and changing property rights, as designated by the
   evolving marine protected area network and other institutional changes
   (e.g., fisheries management), defined multiple goods and ecosystem
   services and altered who could benefit from them. The rezoning of the
   Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in 2004 substantially altered the types
   and distribution of property rights and associated benefits from
   ecosystem goods and services. Initially, common-pool resources were
   enjoyed as common and private benefits at the expense of public goods
   (overexploited fisheries and reduced biodiversity and ecosystem health).
   The rezoning redefined the available goods and benefits and who could
   benefit, prioritizing public goods and benefits (i.e., biodiversity
   conservation), and inducing private costs (through reduced fishing). We
   also found that the original conceptualization of the step-wise
   progression of property rights from user to owner oversimplifies
   property rights based on its division into operational and
   collective-choice rule-making levels. Instead, we suggest that a
   diversity of available management tools implemented simultaneously can
   result in interactions that are seldom fully captured by the original
   conceptualization of the bundling of property rights. Understanding the
   complexities associated with overlapping property rights and multiple
   goods and ecosystem services, particularly within large-scale systems,
   can help elucidate the source and nature of some of the governance
   challenges that large protected areas are facing.},

Abstract = {Tourism is a financing mechanism considered by many donor-funded marine
   conservation initiatives. Here we assess the potential role of visitor
   entry fees, in generating the necessary revenue to manage a marine
   protected area (MPA), established through a Global Environmental
   Facility Grant, in a temperate region of Chile. We assess tourists'
   willingness to pay (WTP) for an entry fee associated to management and
   protection of the MPA. Results show 97 \% of respondents were willing to
   pay an entrance fee. WTP predictors included the type of tourist,
   tourists' sensitivity to crowding, education, and understanding of
   ecological benefits of the MPA. Nature-based tourists state median WTP
   values of US\$ 4.38 and Sun-sea-sand tourists US\$ 3.77. Overall, entry
   fees could account for 10-13 \% of MPA running costs. In Chile, where
   funding for conservation runs among the weakest in the world, visitor
   entry fees are no panacea in the short term and other mechanisms,
   including direct state/government support, should be considered.},

Title = {Poverty and the use of destructive fishing gear near east African marine
   protected areas},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {36},
Number = {4},
Pages = {321-326},
Abstract = {Poverty may be an important influence on the exploitation of marine
   resources in tropical developing countries. A number of studies have
   hypothesized that destructive fishing gears, which can degrade habitat,
   capture high proportions of juvenile fish and ultimately lead to reduced
   yields, are primarily used by the poorer segments of society. However,
   few studies have empirically tested this relationship. This paper
   examines relationships between the use of destructive seine nets and
   thirteen socioeconomic conditions in communities adjacent to three
   peri-urban marine protected areas in east Africa. Fishers using
   destructive gears were younger, less likely to have capital invested in
   the fishery, had lower fortnightly expenditures and were poorer in two
   multivariate indices of material style of life. Based on the two
   multivariate material style of life indices, a binary logistic
   regression model classified whether fishers used destructive gears with
   almost 70\% accuracy. These findings are broadly consistent with the
   literature on poverty traps, which are situations in which the poor are
   unable to mobilize the resources required to overcome low-income
   situations and consequently engage in behaviour that may reinforce their
   own poverty. Managers aiming to reduce destructive gear use may need to
   partner with civil society and donors to help break poverty traps.},

Title = {Systematic Planning and Ecosystem-Based Management as Strategies to
   Reconcile Mangrove Conservation with Resource Use},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {About 120 million people worldwide live within 10 km of large mangrove
   forests, and many of them directly depend on the goods and services
   provided by these ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how to
   synchronize ecological definitions and legal conservation strategies
   regarding mangroves, especially in developing countries, such as Brazil.
   The influence of human populations' socio-economic context in mangrove
   conservation policies, as well associated challenges in incorporating
   this influence, are underestimated or, often, largely ignored.
   Considering the recent threats emerging from changes in legislation and
   the lack of spatial and social-ecological integrated data to plan
   mangrove conservation in Brazil, this paper aims to answer the following
   questions: (1) What suitable measures could managers and other decision
   makers adopt for efficient mangrove conservation planning?; (2) What are
   the site-specific, social-ecological aspects that need to be taken into
   account when deciding on conservation and management strategies?; and
   (3) How could science contribute to the development of these measures?
   In order to achieve an ecosystem-based management approach, mangrove
   ecosystems should not be divided into sub-systems, but instead treated
   as an integrated system. Furthermore, interconnections with other
   coastal ecosystems must be assessed and taken into account. This is
   crucial for effective systematic conservation planning. Also, most of
   the particular social-ecological aspects in the different types of
   mangrove ecosystems along the Brazilian coast, and how those differences
   might be considered while planning for conservation, remain poorly
   understood. Based on similar drivers of change, geological features, and
   likely impacts of climate change, a macro-unit approach is proposed to
   group mangrove systems along the Brazilian coast and guide national
   policies. This paper draws parallels with management approaches
   worldwide to find common points and hence lessons to be applied in other
   regional realms. It considers the issues of legal vulnerability and
   needs for social-ecological data on mangroves, contributing toward
   systematic conservation planning and ecosystem-based management for

Title = {An integrated risk-based assessment of the North Sea to guide

Abstract = {This study provides an integrated perspective to ecosystem based
   management (EBM) by considering a diverse array of societal goals, i.e.
   sustainable food supply, clean energy and a healthy marine ecosystem,
   and a selection of management measures to achieve them. The primary aim
   of this exercise is to provide guidance for (more) integrated EBM in the
   North Sea based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of those
   management measures in contributing to the conservation of marine
   biodiversity. A secondary aim is to identify the requirements of the
   knowledge base to guide such future EBM initiatives.
   Starting from the societal goals we performed a scoping exercise to
   identify a ``focal social-ecological system{''} which is a subset of the
   full social-ecological system but considered adequate to guide EBM
   towards the achievement of those societal goals. A semi-quantitative
   risk assessment including all the relevant human activities, their
   pressures and the impacted ecosystem components was then applied to
   identify the main threats to the North Sea biodiversity and evaluate the
   effectiveness of the management measures to mitigate those threats.
   This exercise revealed the need for such risk-based approaches in
   providing a more integrated perspective but also the trade-off between
   being comprehensive but qualitative versus quantitative but limited in
   terms of the ``focal{''} part of the SES that can be covered. The
   findings in this paper provide direction to the (further) development of
   EBM and its knowledge base that should ultimately allow an integrated
   perspective while maintaining its capacity to deliver the accuracy and
   detail needed for decision-making. (C) 2018 Wageningen UR Instritute for

   natural resource users in collaborative management arrangements
   (frequently called comanagement). However, there are few empirical
   studies demonstrating the social and institutional conditions conducive
   to successful comanagement outcomes, especially in small-scale
   fisheries. Here, we evaluate 42 comanagement arrangements across five
   countries and show that: (i) comanagement is largely successful at
   meeting social and ecological goals; (ii) comanagement tends to benefit
   wealthier resource users; (iii) resource overexploitation is most
   strongly influenced by market access and users' dependence on resources;
   and (iv) institutional characteristics strongly influence livelihood and
   compliance outcomes, yet have little effect on ecological conditions.},

Title = {Conservation ready marine spatial planning},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {153},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Marine spatial planning (MSP) often favors blue growth objectives over
   biodiversity conservation, diminishing its role in promoting
   sustainability. We used in-depth qualitative document analysis to assess
   how conservation principles and priorities are included in five case
   studies to identify a path for better integrating conservation with MSP.
   Five themes emerged, reflecting conservation in MSP from weak to strong
   inclusion: (1) prioritizing economy; (2) ecosystems as limits; (3)
   social-ecological systems; (4) ecosystems as functional; and (5)
   ecosystems as fundamental. Our analysis suggests MSP priorities for
   managing or mitigating impacts and conservation was less apparent,
   though some plans appear more prepared to integrate conservation. We
   propose the concept of conservation ready MSP, where plans are designed
   to integrate conservation in MSP as a way to support sustained ocean
   use. MSP may be more conservation ready when specific commitments are
   made and conservation underpins ocean use, reflecting the fundamental
   role of biodiversity conservation in sustainability.},

Title = {Does polycentricity fit? Linking social fit with polycentric governance
   in a large-scale marine protected area},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {290},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Scholars have theorized that polycentricity may produce benefits that
   promote effective, sustainable governance of complex social-ecological
   systems. Yet, little empirical research exists exploring whether and how
   these benefits emerge and what additional outcomes polycentric
   governance systems produce. This paper presents an empirical examination
   of Papaha \& macr;naumokua \& macr;kea Marine National Monument (PMNM),
   one of the longest-standing and largest marine protected areas in the
   world. Monument governance is structured as a polycentric system,
   including semi-autonomous decision-making groups and governance actors
   that interact across jurisdiction, geography, and decision-making
   levels. Through analysis of qualitative empirical data, we explore
   whether and how PMNM functions as theory predicts, with a particular
   focus on social fit and how it has evolved over time. Findings indicate
   that PMNM largely exhibits social fit for governance actors, and they
   add empirical support and additional nuance to theoretical
   understandings of functional polycentricity. Specifically, the case
   suggests additional contextual features that might promote social fit,
   including sufficient time and resources, clear communication and shared
   understanding, and socially astute and strategically savvy governance
   actors holding key governance positions. The article demonstrates that
   social fit can increase or decrease over time, and that different actors
   may perceive its presence and extent differently. These findings suggest
   avenues for additional research into how the enabling conditions of
   polycentric governance systems and the contextual features that enliven
   those systems in practice may interact and affect functionality and
   other outcomes.},

Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {37},
Number = {6},
Pages = {633-655},
Abstract = {One of the major barriers to addressing complex social-ecological issues
   through integrated coastal management (ICM) is a lack of
   intergovernmental coordination and cooperation (horizontal and vertical
   fragmentation). This article describes an effort to overcome the
   barriers to ICM in Sri Lanka by fostering intergovernmental
   collaboration and initiating adaptive governance to restore one town,
   Hikkaduwa, and its associated marine protected area (MPA) and coastal
   zone habitats. Administrators from 12 national and local governmental
   agencies that are responsible for aspects of coastal management in the
   town of Hikkaduwa participated in a series of formal and informal
   workshops and a week-long tour of ICM projects in the Philippines.
   Outcomes demonstrate that these informal and formal meetings, workshops,
   and travel experiences fostered trust, social capital, and attitudinal
   organizational commitment (AOC). The experiences motivated members to
   overcome vertical and horizontal governance fragmentation through the
   formation of an independent intergovernmental committee for the
   restoration of Hikkaduwa into a sustainable and resilient community. ICM
   activities undertaken by the newly formed organization suggest that
   internal leadership capacity, effective local-national partnerships,
   explicitly linked ecological-economic projects, and long-term commitment
   are necessary conditions for success. Overall, attainment of
   sustainability and resilience through successful ICM should be thought
   of as a journey and not a destination.},

Title = {How to articulate the multiple value dimensions of ecosystem services?
   Insights from implementing the PArticulatES framework in a coastal
   social-ecological system in Portugal},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {38},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Ecosystem services is a value-laden concept, encompassing multiple
   legitimate views, value systems and potential controversies. On the
   other hand, it offers a platform to promote participation and to search
   for new paths of collaborative action. Based on these assumptions this
   work aims to answer the question ``how to structure a participatory
   process for the integration and articulation of multiple values of
   ecosystem services to inform decision-making processes in a coastal
   social-ecological system?{''}. This paper outlines a three-stage
   participatory framework (PArticulatES) that was developed to scope,
   conceptualize and articulate ecosystem services values. The PArticulatES
   framework was piloted in a coastal and marine protected area: the
   Arrabida Natural Park in Portugal. The pilot test results and
   participants' evaluation on the process allowed the identification of
   valuable lessons and critical factors for the success of the
   implementation of the framework. The proposed three-stage process was
   able to provide a coherent platform for engaging stakeholders in
   ecosystem services scoping, assessment and decision support. Key
   outcomes regarding knowledge sharing and co-creation are conducive to
   social learning about ecosystem services. Ultimately, this framework
   offers structured guidelines for teasing out multiple value dimensions,
   which may be applied to different types of decision processes in coastal
   and marine ecosystems. However, some challenges may arise when
   implementing this framework. Those include a dependency on a steering
   team with adequate skills and resources to support each process stage, a
   sustained level of participants' engagement throughout the sequence of
   events, and a commitment from decision-makers' regarding the
   consideration of process outcomes.},

Abstract = {Territorial use rights in fisheries (TURFs) can be an effective tool for
   the management of coastal resources, and interest in their use is
   increasing around the world. However, there is little guidance on how to
   design them. Fortunately, other marine spatial tools, such as marine
   protected areas (MPAs), have already addressed questions similar to
   those now central to successful TURF design. We propose that
   well-established lessons from MPA design should provide a strong basis
   for the development of design criteria for TURFs. In this paper, we
   review the MPA literature to inform the design of TURFs based on the
   similarities and differences of these 2 marine spatial management tools.
   We found that TURF design can obtain important lessons from MPA theory,
   for example on how to diminish the effects of environmental and human
   disturbance. In particular, the nascent idea of creating TURF networks
   can benefit significantly from the literature on MPA networks.},

Title = {Identifying the strengths and weaknesses of conservation planning at
   different scales: the Coral Triangle as a case study},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Each year, hundreds of conservation plans are developed to direct
   limited resources toward conservation in priority areas. Conservation
   plans are developed at different levels, defined here as points on a
   range of spatial extent varying from global to local. However,
   approaches to integrate plans effectively across levels remain elusive.
   To plan across multiple levels most effectively, the relative strengths
   and weaknesses of planning at different levels must be understood.
   Taking the Coral Triangle region of the western Pacific Ocean as a case
   study, we apply an adapted social-ecological system (SES) framework to
   assess the scalar coverage of conservation plans, i.e., the extent to
   which plans developed at one level adequately consider the social and
   ecological levels and components (i.e., resource units, resource
   systems, governance systems, actors) of an SES. No conservation plans we
   assessed had complete cross-level coverage. Plans most adequately
   addressed social and ecological components at the same level of planning
   and, to a lesser extent, lower levels. In line with previous literature
   suggesting that social factors are most relevant at local levels, we
   found that local-level plans engaged with the greatest number of
   stakeholder groups, whereas higher level plans more adequately addressed
   ecological components. Given that it appears more practicable for higher
   level plans to consider components at lower levels, the onus should fall
   on higher level planning to link to lower levels. Achieving complete
   cross-level coverage will require vertical interactions between planning
   processes at different levels, and conceiving of planning processes
   across all levels as connected planning systems. We demonstrate how an
   adapted SES framework can be used by conservation planners to assess the
   cross-level coverage of their own plans and to formulate appropriate
   conservation objectives to address social and ecological components at
   different levels.},

Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {Increasingly, natural resource managers see the marine protected areas
   that they are responsible for as linked social-ecological systems. This
   requires an equal focus on managing for both natural and human
   dimensions of the protected estate. Consequently, identification of
   indicators that represent the human dimensions of Large Scale Marine
   Protected Areas (LSMPAs) such as the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is
   critical if these values are to be properly considered as part of
   standard management practice. Assessment and monitoring of the human
   dimensions of LSMPAs requires a replicable, collaborative process,
   rolled out at local scales but comparable across vast, socially and
   geographically diverse areas. This paper explores the application of a
   process for the development, assessment, and monitoring of the GBR's
   human dimensions. The process includes (a) development of a conceptual
   framework that links indicator sets to the desired state of the GBR's
   human dimensions; and (b) a collaborative approach including ten
   practical steps to implement assessment, monitoring, and benchmarking of
   the human dimensions of an LSMPA. We conclude with examination of
   challenges and opportunities for implementing this process in the GBR
   context, specifically with respect to the targets and objectives of the
   Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan.},

Abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were designed to address
   interactions between the economy, society, and the biosphere. However,
   indicators used for assessing progress toward the goals do not account
   for these interactions. To understand the potential implications of this
   compartmentalized assessment framework, we explore progress evaluations
   toward SDG 14 (Life below Water) and intersecting social goals presented
   in submissions to the UN High-Level Political Forum. We show that there
   is a disconnect between the apparent progress shown by indicators and
   long-term sustainability; for example, short-term gains in reducing
   hunger or poverty might be undermined by poor ocean health, particularly
   in countries dependent on fisheries or developing their blue economy. We
   suggest an extension to existing indicator assessments to inte-grate
   scenarios and social-ecological modeling. This approach would ensure
   that decision makers are provided with knowledge fundamental to
   directing actions to attain SDGs while minimizing unintended outcomes
   due to interactions among goals.},

Abstract = {This story is concerned with the intersection of governance,
   stewardship, care taking, and extraction. It is centred on insights
   gained through repeated encounters with bait prawns during 7years of
   fieldwork in Stilbaai, South Africa. These prawns are intended as
   angling bait, but they are entangled in a host of complications-or
   relations-the discovery of which eventually led me see them differently
   than before. More recently, I have looked into the role of marine
   protected areas in the everyday lives of residents, researching
   conservation management in Stilbaai in connection with the Southern Cape
   Interdisciplinary Fisheries Research project. In that work, I use the
   idea of relationality, as understood from an anthropological
   perspective, to speak about what long-term stewardship needs to take
   into account. Understanding more about the mudprawn and where it lives
   in the ecosystem, how people extract it, what it is used for, and how it
   is thought of has provided an access point for me into thinking about
   coastal social-ecological systems and how to communicate their needs. In
   this story, I reflect on these creatures as they live in my research,
   showing what this species can teach about coastal sustainability more
   generically.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Worldwide, fisheries have experienced change over time. An excess of
   exploitation for providing food has led to overfishing and the depletion
   of fish stocks. However, fishing communities are also part of the
   cultural heritage and contribute to the attractiveness of coastal areas
   to tourists. Our aim is to identify if ecosystem service assessments
   (ESA) can reflect the condition of fisheries and their economic and
   social aspects. We developed a tailored, expert-based ESA and applied it
   to two case studies in the eastern German Baltic Sea under different
   fishery management scenarios. The results show that reducing fishing
   pressure, actively restoring habitats, and improving their ecological
   status increase the provision of most ecosystem services. We discuss and
   conclude that ESAs allow for a holistic view on fisheries that goes
   beyond the economic importance of fisheries and shows both the
   interdependence between fisheries and healthy marine ecosystems, and
   their relevance for coastal communities. Such a holistic view is
   necessary for a sustainable approach to fisheries management. Our
   approach is easily transferable to other regions, and can be used to
   structure discussion on fisheries management scenarios, as well as to
   track and visualize societal changes.},

Abstract = {Coastal social ecological systems in eastern Africa are subject to a
   range of environmental, social and economic changes. They are already
   vulnerable to these multiple stressors, and the impacts of climate
   change are likely to further exacerbate their vulnerabilities. Some of
   these impacts may be observed and experienced already. The analysis
   presented in this paper is based on mixed methods empirical research
   exploring local perceptions of recent changes at four sites in coastal
   Tanzania and Mozambique. People recognise and rank a number of climate
   and non-climate stressors which have contributed towards more risky and
   less diverse livelihoods. Importantly, regional and international policy
   initiatives - in the form of river basin management in Mozambique and
   South Africa, and development of a Marine Protected Area in Tanzania -
   are perceived to further erode resilience and exacerbate
   vulnerabilities. We suggest this is a form of policy misfit, where
   policies developed to address a specific issue do not take account of
   cross-scale dynamics of change, the interactions between multiple
   stressors, nor longer term climate change. This policy misfit may be
   remedied by a move towards adaptive forms of governance, and
   necessitates an explicit focus on building the adaptive capacity of the
   poor and most vulnerable in society. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Sustainably managing ecosystems is challenging, especially for complex
   systems such as coral reefs. This study develops critical reference
   points for sustainable management by using a large empirical dataset on
   the coral reefs of the western Indian Ocean to investigate associations
   between levels of target fish biomass (as an indicator of fishing
   intensity) and eight metrics of ecosystem state. These eight ecological
   metrics each exhibited specific thresholds along a continuum of fishable
   biomass ranging from heavily fished sites to old fisheries closures.
   Three thresholds lay above and five below a hypothesized window of
   fishable biomass expected to produce a maximum multispecies sustainable
   yield (B-MMSY). Evaluating three management systems in nine countries,
   we found that unregulated fisheries often operate belowthe B-MMSY,
   whereas fisheries closures and, less frequently, gear-restricted
   fisheries were within or above this window. These findings provide
   tangible management targets for multispecies coral reef fisheries and
   highlight key tradeoffs required to achieve different fisheries and
   conservation goals.},

Title = {The inclusion of fisheries and tourism in marine protected areas to
   support conservation in Indonesia},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {146},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {With the rapid growth of Indonesia's marine protected area (MPAs) estate
   in Indonesia, reaching 23.9 million hectares by January 2020, attention
   needs to be focused on strengthening the effectiveness of MPA
   management. Consolidating and expanding protection of Indonesia's marine
   resources is critical with increasing pressure from a fast-expanding
   population, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, pollution,
   coastal development, un-sustainable tourism and climate change.
   Biodiversity conservation must therefore concurrently consider multiple
   economic sectors such as fisheries and tourism, and their synergies with
   MPA management. This paper aims to outline the current landscape of
   fisheries and marine tourism pertaining to area-based conservation in
   Indonesia, to inform and support improved integration into effective MPA
   management. Four areas to focus efforts were identified: diversification
   of governance types of community-based management, improved coordination
   be-tween fisheries and MPAs during planning and management
   implementation, the development and support of pathways for sustainable
   tourism, and planning for future conditions. Sustainable development for
   fisheries and tourism must be incorporated into all aspects of MPA
   management, whilst recognising that current management systems are
   insufficient to ensure long-term sustainability for natural resources
   and local communities, and strategies need to increase resilience of
   social-ecological systems in anticipation of future conditions.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs provide food and livelihoods for hundreds of millions of
   people as well as harbour some of the highest regions of biodiversity in
   the ocean. However, overexploitation, land-use change and other local
   anthropogenic threats to coral reefs have left many degraded.
   Additionally, coral reefs are faced with the dual emerging threats of
   ocean warming and acidification due to rising CO2 emissions, with dire
   predictions that they will not survive the century. This review
   evaluates the impacts of climate change on coral reef organisms,
   communities and ecosystems, focusing on the interactions between climate
   change factors and local anthropogenic stressors. It then explores the
   shortcomings of existing management and the move towards ecosystem-based
   management and resilience thinking, before highlighting the need for
   climate change-ready marine protected areas (MPAs), reduction in local
   anthropogenic stressors, novel approaches such as human-assisted
   evolution and the importance of sustainable socialecological systems. It
   concludes that designation of climate change-ready MPAs, integrated with
   other management strategies involving stakeholders and participation at
   multiple scales such as marine spatial planning, will be required to
   maximise coral reef resilience under climate change. However, efforts to
   reduce carbon emissions are critical if the long-term efficacy of local
   management actions is to be maintained and coral reefs are to survive.},

Volume = {408},
Number = {1-2, SI},
Pages = {3-10},

Abstract = {The literature on coral reefs and human resource use or fishing is
   reviewed less from the perspective of summarizing findings but more from
   the sociological perspective of what scientists chose to study, publish,
   and cite in journal articles. The motivation was to determine if coral
   reef science is generating information needed to solve the coral reef
   climate and fisheries crisis that has been publicized in many of the
   highest visibility and cited publications. The social-ecological system
   of coral reefs involves the environment, the ecosystem, human harvesting
   and social organization and the policies that arise from their
   interaction. Regardless of the focus and findings of any science
   investigation on this system, recommendations for management are
   limited, and include restrictions on space, time of use, effort, gear,
   species, size, and gender. Evaluating the scientific journal literature
   in the Scopus database on these restrictions indicates a disparity in
   focus for both publications and citations. The greatest number of
   scientists and citations are focused on spatial closures and fishing
   effort, effort seen as the problem and closures the solution. The other
   restrictions, that represent less extreme forms of management and have
   lower short-term social costs and trade offs, are not well studied and,
   when studied, investigated by either a small group of associated
   colleagues or transient one-publication investigators. When the values,
   selectivity, and incentives of scientists conflict with resource users
   desires for knowledge, incentives, and profits the resulting divide can
   weaken the social relevance and applicability of science and delay
   real-world problem solving. Societal engagement, acceptance,
   objectivity, and finding solutions are likely to increase if scientific
   effort is spread more evenly across this full spectrum of management
   restrictions and more components of the social-ecological system. (C)

Title = {A review of the current global status of blast fishing: Causes,
   implications and solutions},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {262},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Blast fishing (known variously as dynamite and bomb fishing) has caused
   long-term damage to reefs and coastal livelihoods for decades. Blasting
   reefs with explosives provides fish for commercial and consumption
   purposes across the globe, but the practice has also led to large-scale
   destruction of coral reefs in much of Southeast Asia, Tanzania, the Red
   Sea, and other areas in Asia, Africa, Europe and South America. Despite
   its destructive nature and widespread dispersion, there have been few
   reviews that offer insight to assist in analysing and managing this
   broad-scale threat. We address this gap with a comprehensive global
   analysis of the blast fishing literature to explore the distribution of
   blast fishing, primary drivers, ecological and economic implications and
   solutions. Our review analysed 212 papers from seven databases. Blasting
   is widespread, misreported, and ongoing. Lack of effective enforcement
   and governance drives blasting; socioeconomic causes may contribute but
   are not dominant. A combination of deterrence measures and co-managed
   marine protected areas (MPAs) emerges as the most effective solution to
   blasting. Our review provides a basis upon which further analysis can
   build in order to better understand blast fishing and thereby improve
   conservation outcomes for coral reef ecosystems, as well as the outlook
   for fishing communities.},

Title = {Examining linkages between ecosystem services and social wellbeing to
   improve governance for coastal conservation in Jamaica},
Journal = {ECOSYSTEM SERVICES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {This research examines perceptions of the linkages between ecosystem
   services (ES) and social wellbeing in a smallscale fishing community in
   Bluefields, Jamaica. It analyzes the perceived changes to these linkages
   based on the impacts of a marine protected area (MPA) on this coastal
   social-ecological system. MPAs can have positive long-term social and
   ecological effects, but in the short-term they can negatively impact
   communities, and careful attention to these impacts is needed to achieve
   positive conservation outcomes. We conducted 42 semi-structured
   interviews and six focus groups discussions with community members in
   Bluefields. Key findings from this research include: 1) the importance
   of provisioning (e.g., fish, lobster) and cultural ES (e.g., cultural
   heritage, bequest values) and their bundled qualities to both fishers
   and non-fishers; 2) the perceived impact of the MPA is highest for
   inshore fishers, while offshore fishers/non-fishers reported few/no
   negative impacts; and 3) inshore fishers perceive being more
   marginalized in governance processes, despite reporting the greatest
   negative change to ES access and social wellbeing from MPA
   implementation. The results suggest that governance processes for
   coastal conservation must acknowledge the individual and shared values
   of coastal areas and traditional livelihoods to achieve long-term
   legitimacy and support.},

Title = {Co-management and adaptive co-management: Two modes of governance in a
   Honduran marine protected area},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {39},
Pages = {128-134},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Selecting the best mode of governance for marine protected areas (MPAs)
   especially in developing countries has generated considerable
   controversy in the academic and policy literature during the last 20
   years. In this article, two modes - co-management (CM) and adaptive
   co-management (ACM) - are analysed in detail, and an examination is made
   of an attempt to put these modes sequentially into practice in the first
   (2003-2009) and second (2008-2013) management plans, respectively, of
   the Cayos Cochinos MPA (CCMPA) in Honduras. Extensive fieldwork was
   carried out during 2006-2010 in three communities dependent on the CCMPA
   (Rio Esteban, Nueva Armenia, and Chachahuate) including key informant
   interviews, focus group meetings, household surveys, and participant
   observation. The paper's findings are (1) that while the first plan
   implemented some CM principles (such as sharing responsibility between
   government, stakeholders and NGOs) it failed to deliver other CM
   principles (such as transparency and accountability); and (2) that while
   the second plan increased participation and transparency, and used a
   more adaptive approach, it still left many stakeholders out of the
   decision-making process, and its processes of experimentation,
   monitoring and social learning were very limited. The fact is that CM
   and ACM are laudable objectives, but very difficult to implement in
   full. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Healing Brazil's Blue Amazon: The Role of Knowledge Networks in

Abstract = {This paper dedicates to understanding of what is needed to achieve the
   transformation of ocean governance. Based on the theory of
   transformative agency conceptualized in a multi-level governance
   context, we build on recent novel inter- and transdisciplinary research
   in Brazil to explore the opportunities for transformation in the
   dynamic, complex, and multi-level field of ocean governance. We focus
   this analysis on three transformation processes toward developing a
   socially and ecologically coherent marine protected area network as the
   core of a marine spatial planning process for enhanced ecosystem-based
   polycentric governance of the country's Exclusive Economic Zone. The
   findings illuminate leverage points for achieving (much needed)
   transformation in Brazilian ocean governance and potentially beyond.
   These include: connecting transformative actions into coherent
   narratives and testing strategic advice derived from theories of
   transformative agency to promote regime shifts in ocean governance
   systems; setting of more ambitious social mobilization targets;
   fostering orchestration of knowledge-networks considering multiple
   issues, territorial and institutional levels; implementing institutional
   learning experiments; supporting transformational trajectories toward
   co-evolutionary, polycentric, ecosystem- and area-based ocean governance
   systems; and pursuing gradual, incremental structural understanding of a
   given knowledge network field as a major driver of catalyzing
   transformative change. Hereby, this article advances understanding of
   how to better navigate the transformation toward enhanced sustainability
   in an important part of the Atlantic and hence of our global ocean.},

Abstract = {Designing effective spatial management strategies is challenging because
   marine ecosystems are highly dynamic and opaque, and extractive entities
   such as fishing fleets respond endogenously to ecosystem changes in ways
   that depend on ecological and policy context. We present a modelling
   framework, marlin, that can be used to efficiently simulate the
   bio-economic dynamics of marine systems in support of both management
   and research. We demonstrate marlin's capabilities by focusing on two
   case studies on the conservation and food production impacts of marine
   protected areas (MPAs): a coastal coral reef and a pelagic tuna fishery.
   In the coastal coral reef example, we explore how heterogeneity in
   species distributions and fleet preferences can affect distributional
   outcomes of MPAs. In the pelagic case study, we show how our model can
   be used to assess the climate resilience of different MPA design
   strategies, as well as the climate sensitivity of different fishing
   fleets. This paper demonstrates how intermediate complexity simulation
   of coupled bio-economic dynamics can help communities predict and
   potentially manage trade-offs among conservation, fisheries yields and
   distributional outcomes of management policies affected by spatial
   bio-economic dynamics.},

Abstract = {Seeing the ocean through the eyes of seabirds could help meet the
   challenges of managing common-pool marine resources both in protected
   and unprotected areas. First, seabirds are top-predators, exposed to all
   threats affecting the oceans, and this makes them ideal sentinel
   organisms for monitoring changes within marine ecosystems. Second,
   seabirds cross both ecological and political boundaries, and following
   their movements should help making interdependencies within and between
   marine ecosystems more visible. Third, seabirds are conspicuous and
   often charismatic animals, which interact differently with different
   groups of stakeholders and provide the opportunity to acknowledge and
   discuss each other's values and interests. In this paper, we present
   these research avenues using a seabirds' view, for tackling marine
   conservation and management issues, and we give operational examples of
   implementation based on our work in the English Channel. (C) 2016

Abstract = {We assessed the ability of socioeconomic variables (population size,
   perceived infringement, and community infrastructure) and design
   features (closure age and area) to predict ecological indicators of
   ``success{''} in seventeen coral-reef fishery closures in the Western
   Indian Ocean. Success was measured as absolute fish biomass and coral
   cover in closures, and the response ratio of these variables indicating
   the level of difference relative to control sites outside closures. Fish
   biomass had a greater and more consistent response to protection than
   coral cover. Human population density had a strong positive association
   with the response of fish biomass, which was driven by lower biomass
   outside marine protected areas (MPAs) in high human population density
   sites, rather than higher biomass within MPAs. Perceived infringement
   was negatively associated with the absolute and response ratio of fish
   biomass. Coral cover was variable, weakly related to closure, and
   positively related to closure size and human population density. This,
   and previous regional studies, indicate that physical design features
   have a modest effect on the response of fish to MPAs, that design
   features interact with compliance, and that human population density
   around closures can indirectly influence the effect of MPAs on fish
   populations.},

Title = {A multilayered network analysis of social participation in the
   management of Marine Protected Areas in Brazil},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {146},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Effective implementation of Marine Protected Areas (MPA) networks
   depends on social participation into management. In this study, a
   multilayered network analysis was used to understand patterns of social
   participation in MPA management in Brazil. To this end, managers were
   invited to answer an online questionnaire about interaction with social
   actors in 7 management activities. Engagement in management activities
   was represented as interactions between social actors and MPAs.
   Different types of management activity were represented as separate
   layers. All responding MPAs (n = 22) reported interactions with social
   actors, resulting in a network with 141 nodes connected by 182 edges.
   Governmental Organizations (GO) prevailed in surveillance and formal
   training activities, research was dominated by universities, monitoring
   activities were shared mainly by universities and Non-Governmental
   Organizations (NGOs), and community groups only had strong participation
   in environmental education activities. The network had low ``edge
   loss{''} resilience with dependency on the participation of social
   actors in the management councils to maintain its current levels of
   connectivity. GOs that have important roles in the protection of
   terrestrial ecosystems have a restricted impact as higher-level
   coordinators of MPAs activities. Thus, the capacity building falls
   mainly on individual MPAs. Management councils are supposed to be the
   ``town halls{''} where the different social sectors come together to
   discuss environmental problems in Brazil. However, some constraints must
   still exist, since only 51 \% of Brazilian MPAs have legally instituted
   their councils. We suggest that their effective implementation, as
   ordered by law, is the best starting point to improve the dismal
   situation of Brazilian MPAs.},

Abstract = {It is necessary, yet challenging, to manage coral reefs to
   simultaneously address a suite of global and local stressors that act
   over the short and long term. Therefore, managers need practical
   guidance on prioritizing the locations and types of conservation that
   most efficiently address their goals using limited resources. This study
   is one of the first examples of a vulnerability assessment for coral
   reefs that uses downscaled global climate change projections and local
   anthropogenic stress data to prioritize coral reef locations for
   conservation investment. Vulnerability was separated into manageable and
   unmanageable components (bleaching likelihood and local anthropogenic
   stressors, respectively), and the highest priority was given to places
   with low levels of unmanageable threats and high levels of manageable
   threats. Following prioritization, resilience characteristics were
   derived from standard reef monitoring data and used to identify the
   specific conservation strategies most likely to succeed given local
   ecological conditions and threats. Using Indonesian coral reefs as a
   case study, 9.1\% of total coral reef area was identified as of high
   conservation priority, including parts of Raja Ampat, Sulawesi, and
   Sumatra that are not currently included in marine protected areas
   (MPAs). Existing MPAs tend to be located in areas less threatened by
   local-scale anthropogenic activities, which has implications for both
   the implementation costs and the likely impact of conservation
   investment. This approach employs common and publicly available data and
   can therefore be replicated wherever managers face the familiar
   challenge of allocating limited conservation resources in the face of
   rapid global change and uncertainty.},

Abstract = {The oceans, as a common-pool resource, are facing an ever increasing
   number of crises and challenges, and the promotion of marine protected
   area (MPA) management is viewed as the best path to resolving such
   issues. This paper takes MPA management in Green Island as the basis for
   its analysis, employing the method of participant observation with the
   aim of discussing changes that occur in institutional partnerships
   throughout the process of MPA management. Results show that, in Green
   Island, in accordance with developmental requirements, there was a trend
   for partnerships to become increasingly complex, and for community level
   organizations to have close ties. Outside organizations are the spark
   that ignites MPA mechanisms, but such organizations first have to court
   the trust of the local people, in order to successfully promote their
   establishment. When community partnership networks mature, further
   challenges to their power develop. `Learning-as-participation' can go
   some way to reducing conflicts that arise from power struggles. As well
   as this, local intermediary organizations play a key role in the
   development of institutional linkages, their main functions being
   coordination of inter-organizational communication, resources
   integration, and expansion of partnership networks. Such organizations
   are unique in their promise of an `indefinite' service, and so can build
   close ties with fundamental community organizations.},

Title = {Reconciling multiple counterfactuals when evaluating biodiversity
   conservation impact in social-ecological systems},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {2},
Pages = {510-521},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {When evaluating the impact of a biodiversity conservation intervention,
   a counterfactual is typically needed. Counterfactuals are possible
   alternative system trajectories in the absence of an intervention.
   Comparing observed outcomes against the chosen counterfactual allows the
   impact (change attributable to the intervention) to be determined.
   Because counterfactuals by definition never occur, they must be
   estimated. Sometimes, there may be many plausible counterfactuals,
   including various drivers of biodiversity change and defined on a range
   of spatial or temporal scales. Here, we posit that, by definition,
   conservation interventions always take place in social-ecological
   systems (SES) (i.e., ecological systems integrated with human actors).
   Evaluating the impact of an intervention in an SES, therefore, means
   taking into account the counterfactuals assumed by different human
   actors. Use of different counterfactuals by different actors will give
   rise to perceived differences in the impacts of interventions, which may
   lead to disagreement about its success or the effectiveness of the
   underlying approach. Despite that there are biophysical biodiversity
   trends, it is often true that no single counterfactual is definitively
   the right one for conservation assessment, so multiple evaluations of
   intervention efficacy could be considered justifiable. Therefore, we
   propose calculating the sum of perceived differences, which captures the
   range of impact estimates associated with different actors in a given
   SES. The sum of perceived differences gives some indication of how
   closely actors in an SES agree on the impacts of an intervention. We
   applied the concept of perceived differences to a set of global,
   national, and regional case studies (e.g., global realization of Aichi
   Target 11 for marine protected areas, effect of biodiversity offsetting
   on vegetation condition in Australia, and influence of conservation
   measures on an endangered ungulate in Central Asia). We explored
   approaches for minimizing the sum, including a combination of
   negotiation and structured decision making, careful alignment of
   expectations on scope and measurement, and explicit recognition of any
   intractable differences between stakeholders.},

Abstract = {Many researchers have pointed to coastal environments and their use for
   energy production, aquaculture, and conservation as key to solving
   profound challenges facing humanity. Navigating this transition in ocean
   space necessitates tools to quantify impacts on displaced marine users,
   including recreational fishers. In this study, we present a novel method
   combining spatial ecological models of recreational catch with
   fine-scale random utility models of site choice to predict the impacts
   of site closures on recreational fishing experiences (fisher welfare).
   We demonstrate our approach by modelling data from over 10 000 fishing
   trips to fine-scale sites across 1500 km of coastline in the south-west
   of Australia and simulating the effects of no-take marine reserves
   recently implemented in the Australian Marine Parks. The results show
   how the combination of random utility modelling with spatial ecological
   methods provides a powerful tool for investigating recreational
   fisheries as joint social-ecological systems and incorporating
   recreational fishing into marine spatial planning.},

Abstract = {The non-material aspects of nature are frequently the most socially
   valued and demanded nature's contributions to people (NCP). This is
   because non-material NCP often lay the foundations of key human
   well-being dimensions such as identities, experiences, and capabilities.
   Yet, while research on material NCP such as food and water abound,
   studies of non-material NCP are relatively scarce. This research gap
   results in a limited understanding of the relationships between
   non-material NCP and human well-being, especially in the marine and
   coastal environment. To understand the relationships between
   non-material NCP and subjective human well-being, we surveyed 453 users
   of Litoral Norte-a multiple-use marine protected area in Portugal. Our
   survey included 16 statement indicators reflecting theoretical
   constructs of subjective well-being. Using factor analysis, we found
   that subjective well-being derived from relating to, interacting with,
   and experiencing marine and coastal sites can be grouped into four
   interpretable cultural dimensions of well-being. These dimensions are
   `engagement with nature \& health', `sense of place', `solitude in
   nature', and `spirituality'. We also found statistically significant
   differences in reported levels of the four dimensions of well-being.
   Reported levels of well-being varied with interviewees' socio-economic
   characteristics and environmental behaviour. Our findings offer
   interesting insights for marine conservation practice and policy that
   aims to foster both biodiversity and human well-being.},

Title = {Satoumi Systems Promoting Integrated Coastal Resources Management: An
   Empirical Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Coastal areas, eco-systems, biodiversity, and fisheries resources have
   been devastated worldwide because of diverse reasons. In Japan, to
   tackle these problems, various activities have been practiced, which
   deeply involve local people in Satoumi. The Satoumi activities are now
   spreading throughout the world. These Satoumi are extremely diverse, and
   it is difficult to capture them with a single definition or perspective.
   Because social-ecological systems in Satoumi areas are extremely
   complicated and highly uncertain, Satoumi co-creation requires
   transdisciplinary approaches in which diverse stakeholders including
   local residents, bilateral knowledge translators, and residential and
   visiting scientists play important roles. This paper reviews the various
   types of Satoumi in Japan and around the world, and Satoumi co-creation
   activities through the transdisciplinary approaches from multiple
   perspectives. The Satoumi co-creation includes not only the traditional
   single approach of resource management but also approaches to enhance
   the resources by direct human intervention, to conserve ecosystems that
   support the resources, and to survey and monitor the resources by
   fishers. This paper also reviews the synergy and integration of
   fisheries and other resource management, such as tourism-related
   activities in marine protected areas in Satoumi.},

Abstract = {Following a series of mass-bleaching events that have seriously degraded
   coral reefs, notably the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, a common

   coral reefs around the world are threatened by a myriad of local
   stressors, including overfishing, destructive fishing, untreated sewage,
   agriculture effluents (nutrients and pesticides), and siltation due to
   deforestation. Reefs will not survive the severe effects of this
   plethora of stressors while waiting until we mitigate climate change. In
   order to safeguard reefs, we need to adopt a new narrative-{''}there are
   diverse ways in which we can improve the chances of saving coral
   reefs{''}-by acting now to: (i) improve their local protection and
   marine protected area networks, (ii) alleviate their critical local
   stressors, (iii) restore degraded and damaged reefs, and (iv) promote
   reef resilience and adaptation (e.g. adaptation networks, assisted
   evolution) to the changing conditions, notably climate change effects.

Title = {Impacts of Climate Variability on Latin American Small-scale Fisheries},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Small-scale fisheries (SSFs) are social-ecological systems that play a
   critical role in terms of food security and poverty alleviation in Latin
   America. These fisheries are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic
   and climatic drivers acting at multiple scales. We review the effects of
   climate variability on Latin American SSFs, and discuss the combined
   effects of two additional human drivers: globalization of markets and
   governance. We show drastic long-term and large-scale effects of climate
   variability, e.g., sea surface temperature anomalies, wind intensity,
   sea level, and climatic indices, on SSFs. These variables, acting in
   concert with economic drivers, have exacerbated stock depletion rates in
   Latin American SSFs. The impact of these drivers varied according to the
   life cycle and latitudinal distribution of the target species, the
   characteristics of the oceanographic systems, and the inherent features
   of the social systems. Our review highlights the urgent need to improve
   management and governance systems to promote resilience as a way to cope
   with the increasing uncertainty about the impacts of climate and
   globalization of markets on Latin American SSFs.},

Abstract = {Coral reefs are in dire need of effective governance, yet the science
   and planning of coral reef protected areas largely stem from wealthy,
   developed nations, with very different social, economic, and cultural
   characteristics than the nations in which most coral reefs occur. Much
   has been written about coral reefs and the use of marine protected areas
   (MPAs) as a management tool, but emerging trends and recommendations
   have not been adequately synthesized for the context of developing
   nations. We found that 60\% of studies on MPA design and planning are
   from North America, Australia, Europe and the Mediterranean. As a
   result, many recommendations about how best to design, implement and
   manage coral reef protected areas may need to be adapted to address the
   needs of other nations. Based on the literature and our experiences, we
   review three emerging trends in MPA design and management, and relate
   these to the context of coral reef developing nations. First, MPA design
   is evolving to merge community (usually bottom-up) and regional (usually
   top-down) planning approaches. Second, the increasing recognition that
   social and ecological systems are tightly coupled is leading to planning
   and management of MPAs that better incorporate the human dimensions of
   reef systems and their linkages with reef ecology. Finally, there has
   been a trend toward adaptive management of MPAs and the emergence of
   related ideas about adaptive planning. These three trends provide
   crucial and much needed opportunities for improving MPAs and their
   effectiveness in coral reef nations. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published

Abstract = {Cooperation is central to collective management of small-scale fisheries
   management, including marine protected areas. Thus an understanding of
   the factors influencing stakeholders' propensity to cooperate to achieve
   shared benefits is essential to accomplishing successful collective
   fisheries management. In this paper we study stakeholders' cooperative
   behavioral disposition and elucidate the role of various socio-economic
   factors in influencing it in the Roviana Lagoon, Western Solomon
   Islands. We employed a Public Goods Game from experimental economics
   tailored to mimic the problem of common pool fisheries management to
   elucidate peoples' cooperative behavior. Using Ostrom's framework for
   analyzing social-ecological systems to guide our analysis, we examined
   how individual-scale variables (e.g., age, education, family size,
   ethnicity, occupational status, personal norms), in the context of
   village-scale variables (e.g., village, governance institutions, group
   coercive action), influence cooperative behavior, as indexed by game
   contribution. Ostrom's framework provides an effective window for
   conceptually peeling back the various socio-economic and governance
   layers which influence cooperation within these communities. The results
   of our research show that the most important resource user
   characteristics influencing cooperative behavior were age, occupation
   and beliefs about giving access to others to fish for commercial gain.
   Through elucidating the factors affecting stakeholders' propensity to
   cooperate to achieve shared benefits, our analysis provides guidance in
   understanding cooperation in relation to collective management of marine
   resources. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Indigenous Environmental Justice within Marine Ecosystems: A Systematic
   Review of the Literature on Indigenous Peoples' Involvement in Marine
   Governance and Management},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {We develop and apply a systematic review methodology to identify and
   understand how the peer-reviewed literature characterises Indigenous
   peoples' involvement in marine governance and management approaches in
   terms of equity and justice worldwide. We reviewed the peer-reviewed
   English-language research articles between January 2015 and September
   2020 for examples of Indigenous peoples' involvement in marine
   governance and management using the analytical lens of environmental
   justice. The majority of research studies highlighted that Indigenous
   peoples experienced some form of environmental injustice linked to
   existing marine governance and management, most notably in the context
   of inequitable decision-making procedures surrounding the establishment
   and operation of marine protected areas. However, there are significant
   gaps in the current literature, including a notable absence of studies
   exploring Indigenous women and other gender minorities' involvement in
   marine planning and management and the limited number of studies about
   Indigenous peoples living throughout Asia, the Arctic, Russia, and
   Africa. More studies are needed to explore collaborative and
   intersectional approaches, including co-governance and co-management and
   ecosystem-based management, and critically evaluate what constitutes
   inclusive, equitable, and just marine governance and management
   processes, practices, and outcomes for different Indigenous peoples
   occupying diverse social-ecological systems.},

Title = {Applying a social-ecological well-being approach to enhance
   opportunities for marine protected area governance},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The design and implementation of ecologically effective marine protected
   areas (MPAs) are influenced by social acceptance and the impact of MPAs
   on communities. Integrative analyses of the social and ecological
   determinants of marine conservation efforts and MPA networks are lacking
   but are needed to achieve desired outcomes. We developed and applied a
   ``social-ecological well-being{''} (SEWB) approach to critically examine
   the linkages between MPAs and well-being in Southwest New Brunswick (Bay
   of Fundy, Canada). SEWB is defined as a social-ecological system state
   in which ecological resilience is sustained, while human needs are met
   and the quality of life of individuals is maintained. We examined (1)
   how stakeholders perceive benefits and costs of MPAs in relation to
   SEWB, and (2) how well-being insights contribute to the effectiveness of
   MPA governance. Using a qualitative case study approach, we conducted 49
   semistructured interviews and 4 focus groups with fishers and other key
   informants at an existing MPA, as well as at an ecologically and
   biologically significant area that is a candidate for a future MPA. We
   identified 15 attributes of SEWB that related to MPAs, such as fishery
   access, community relations, place identity, and natural capital. Three
   key governance insights for decision makers emerged from the
   identification of these attributes: (1) displacement attributable to
   MPAs has implications across material, relational, subjective, and
   ecological dimensions; (2) effective collaboration is critical for
   community support, but perspectives about what constitutes effective
   collaboration may vary across stakeholder groups; and (3) aspects of MPA
   design fit poorly with the local context because they do not take social
   and ecological dynamics into account. Our findings empirically
   demonstrate the applicability of the SEWB framework, suggest a need to
   focus more on governance processes and improving fit, and highlight
   barriers to aligning national and local conservation priorities.},

Title = {Examining the seascape of compliance in US Pacific island fisheries},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {115},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Noncompliance is a major threat to marine social-ecological systems.
   Recent noncompliance research has focused on illegal, unreported, and
   unregulated (IUU) fisheries and capacity shortfalls in marine protected
   areas (MPAs), but less work has assessed other aspects of noncompliance.
   Although there is wide recognition of the role of noncompliance in
   governance failures, the academic literature on compliance rarely
   acknowledges the connections between governance processes, compliance
   activities, and management outcomes. Likewise, scholars often highlight
   instrumental approaches that include law enforcement tools, instead of a
   diverse suite of non-instrumental interventions that encourage voluntary
   compliance through education, outreach, and targeted behavior change. We
   sought to understand the seascape of compliance across the United States
   Pacific islands region, an area of 5.83 million km(2) that includes
   Hawai'i, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and one of
   the world's largest MPAs. The region includes commercial, subsistence,
   and non-commercial fisheries, and a diversity of cultures that rely on
   them. To examine compliance, we employed a qualitative approach,
   including an extensive review of historical and archival data sources,
   an analysis of the fisheries management literature in the region, and 29
   expert interviews. While the literature highlighted the importance of
   enforcement, experts called attention to multiple factors that affected
   compliance, such as capacity, governance processes, and a lack of data.
   Although several fisheries may benefit from an increased enforcement
   presence, we argue that non-instrumental and governance approaches can
   complement enforcement and should be part of an integrated compliance
   approach both in the region and worldwide.},

Title = {Using stakeholders' perspective of ecosystem services and biodiversity
   features to plan a marine protected area},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {40},
Pages = {116-131},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The definition of a common vision that includes social and environmental
   goals, ecosystem services and/or biodiversity features that people are
   interested in maintaining or restoring is a great challenge for marine
   protected areas (MPAs). Recent initiatives have promoted broadening the
   focus from biodiversity conservation alone to the conservation of both
   ecosystem services and biodiversity, indicating that this integration
   should improve support and compliance from stakeholders. Using a
   Multiple-Use Coastal Marine Protected Area recently proposed in northern
   Chile, we investigated (i) stakeholders' perceptions of the valuation of
   ecosystem services, threats to their provision, and the prioritization
   of ecosystem services, biodiversity features, and uses in a planning
   scenario, and (ii) stakeholders' expectations for the establishment of a
   new MPA. The perceptions of different groups of stakeholders were
   compared and statistically analyzed, and the relationships among
   prioritizations were studied using a network approach. Stakeholders
   identified and valued 13 ecosystem services, 28 biodiversity features,
   20 uses and activities, and 22 threats. Significant differences among
   the valuations and prioritizations of different stakeholder groups were
   attributable principally to artisanal fishermen's perceptions of some
   components that are directly related to their activities and
   livelihoods. High expectations of benefits from a new MPA implementation
   were observed for all categories of stakeholders. To relate the
   different valuated components, we proposed a network-based conceptual
   model that reduces complexity, and also as a strategy to communicate
   relationships and trade-offs occurring in this particular
   social-ecological system to the several stakeholders. We strongly
   recommend early stakeholder engagement so as to understand the
   variability in environmental perceptions and then reflect that variation
   in the planning and management actions of MPAs, thus improving support
   for their implementation and achieving conservation and societal goals.
   Our findings indicate that stakeholders' perceptions and prioritizadons
   of ecosystem services, biodiversity features and uses should be used as
   the basis for starting the MPA implementation and planning process. (C)

Title = {Human dimensions of marine protected areas and small-scale fisheries
   management: A review of the interpretations},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {119},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Scientists and managers increasingly recognize the need to address the
   human dimensions (HD) of planning and managing marine systems, but it
   remains unclear what these dimensions entail. This paper presents an
   analysis of the state of the art of interpretations and uses of the term
   HD in the context of marine protected areas (MPA) and small-scale
   fisheries (SSF). Based on previously established descriptors, including
   the coexistence of MPAs and SSFs, we conduct a literature review of 92
   peer-reviewed papers. Thirty-five components of HD are categorized into
   five categories: governance, economic, cultural, political and social.
   Despite multiple interpretations, the notion of HD has a specific
   meaning that involves attitudes, perceptions, beliefs and preferences
   and indicates different human uses and compliance (or lack of
   compliance) with conservation rules. We find that the number of papers
   published per year has generally been increasing, and most papers are
   found in journals related to natural sciences. The low incidence of
   these studies in human and social science journals may generate an
   imbalance since themes such as gender or poverty, are scarce. Overly
   narrow conceptions can create blind spots that reinforce command and
   control approaches despite the emergence of holistic approaches. Despite
   the inevitable overlap among some themes, these 35 components of HD can
   be used as variables and as a starting point to guide managers and
   researchers. A precise definition of HD and its components can also
   support the embodiment of international guidelines, policies and
   management regulations into decision-making arenas and management tools.},

   conservation: Lessons from a marine protected area in Brazil},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {88},
Pages = {174-181},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The success of protected areas as a management tool for biodiversity
   conservation remains as a challenge, and broader approaches for
   protected area management have been proposed. Considering biodiversity
   conservation as an issue of the commons and within the realm of
   social-ecological systems is a promising alternative. In Brazil
   protected areas are under a State management regime, ruled by the
   National System of Conservation Units. The Ecological Station of
   Guaraquecaba (ESG) is a no-take protected area located in the Paranagua
   Estuarine Complex, surrounded by traditional communities. In this
   article, Ostrom's design principles were adapted to assess the
   institutional dynamics of this protected area management, during two
   periods. Research methods included semi-structured interviews,
   participant observation and document analysis. During the first period,
   management actions were oriented to prevent the conversion of forest
   areas into anthropic occupations. The second period originated in 2000
   with the creation of the National System of Conservation Units, which
   established more precise management tools and mechanisms for
   participatory decision making. In both periods there was low fulfillment
   of Ostrom's principles. The main changes over time were the creation of
   the ESG management council as a conflict-resolution mechanism, and an
   increase in the recognition of the rights of local communities. Yet,
   only three of the eight principles are totally present in the current
   institutional arrangement (well-defined boundaries, conflict-resolution
   mechanisms, and minimal recognition of rights). The results suggest a
   not robust institutional arrangement in terms of commons sustainable
   management.},

Abstract = {on the governance and management of Indonesian coastal and marine
   ecosystems. Project objectives were to investigate coastal and marine
   social-ecological dynamics and feedbacks and to analyse socio-political
   and institutional structures and processes in order to support adaptive
   coastal governance. Participating researchers worked in the Spermonde
   Archipelago, off South Sulawesi, Indonesia, between 2007 and 2010.
   Methods included ship-based research excursions, several classical
   surveys, anthropological participant observation, and participatory
   research methods applied by an interdisciplinary social-natural science
   team. This paper summarises our findings and draws policy conclusions.
   First, we discuss Marine Protected Areas and participation focussing on
   local ``rules-in-use{''}. In addition, reef exploitation and local
   livelihoods, in particular fisheries and mariculture, and the existing
   social networks and hierarchies in fisheries are explored to understand
   social vulnerability, resilience and marine resource governance in the
   context of the Spermonde Archipelago. An outline of major policy
   recommendations concludes this article. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published

Title = {Pathways to integrate Indigenous and local knowledge in ocean governance
   processes: Lessons from the Algoa Bay Project, South Africa},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN 6},
Abstract = {The Introduction of this paper argues that current coastal and ocean
   management approaches like marine spatial planning (MSP) often do not
   adequately acknowledge and integrate Indigenous and Local Knowledge
   (ILK). This is problematic because how humans value and perceive coastal
   and marine resources is integrally linked to how they use and manage
   these resources, especially in adapting to social-ecological change.
   Coastal and marine resources are situated within complex
   social-ecological systems that are culturally, economically,
   historically and politically embedded. Therefore, management approaches
   have to integrate transdisciplinary and contextual perspectives in order
   to be relevant, sustainable and adaptive. Following extensive research
   in Algoa Bay, South Africa this article highlights several pathways to
   bridge the gap between existing ILK and current coastal and ocean
   management approaches. The Methods section discusses how the authors
   worked in tandem with a bottom-up (engaging with Indigenous and local
   coastal and marine resource users) and top-down (engaging with coastal
   governance authorities and practitioners) approach. In order to answer
   the primary research question ``How can ILK be integrated into
   area-based ocean management like MSP{''}? the authors employed
   arts-based participatory methods as well as in-depth interviews and
   workshops with coastal governance authorities and practitioners over
   several months. This work then culminated in a one-day multi-stakeholder
   workshop which brought both ILK holders and coastal authorities and
   practitioners together to collaboratively identify pathways to integrate
   this knowledge into coastal and ocean management. In the Results and
   Discussion section the authors present and discuss five co-identified
   pathways to integrate ILK in coastal and ocean management which include:
   adopting contextual approaches to coastal and ocean management;
   increasing transparency and two-way communication between coastal
   authorities and users; increasing access to relevant and useable
   information; reviewing and amending relevant MSP legislation towards a
   stronger connection between MSP and Indigenous knowledge legislation; as
   well as amending legislation pertaining to access to coastal and marine
   areas. In the Conclusion it is argued that ILK coastal communities want
   to be meaningfully included in how their coastline and ocean resources
   are managed and also seek increased access to coastal areas. By
   highlighting pathways to include ILK and the knowledge holders
   themselves, this paper seeks to contribute to improved protection and
   sustainable management of marine resource use.},

Title = {Perceptions of fishing access restrictions and the disparity of benefits

Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {417-437},

Abstract = {Achieving high compliance with resource-use management policies is a
   critical concern to achieving sustainability, particularly in poor
   countries. Willingness to comply may depend on the values and
   perceptions of benefits and legitimacy of the restrictions.
   Consequently, we interviewed and evaluated the perceptions of fishing
   restrictions among similar to 2100 marine fisheries stakeholders
   (resource users and managers) in 102 fishing villages in Kenya,
   Madagascar, Mozambique and Tanzania. We hypothesized that perceived
   benefits would decline and social inequity increase along a hypothesized
   gradient of increasing access restriction - ranging from minimum size of
   fish to fisheries closures. Managers did not recognize the hypothesized
   access restriction gradient, seeing most restrictions as beneficial, but
   with some nation-specific distinctions. Village-level responses of
   resource users varied by country, and overall perceived benefits of
   access restrictions increased with the wealth, education and membership
   in fishing organizations. In Kenya and Tanzania, some communities with
   views that differed greatly from managers were, in places, found near
   marine protected areas and they perceived more benefits accruing to the
   government than resource users for the strongest access restrictions.
   Madagascar and Mozambique fishing villages had low between-community
   variability, and their responses did not reflect the hypothesized
   restriction gradient or strong social disparity, which may reflect
   limited practical experience with restrictions. These results suggest
   that countries with stronger central governments contained villages with
   more between-community variability and perceived social disparity than
   weaker governments. We argue that transparent negotiations with
   stakeholders about the scales of costs and benefits should increase
   compliance with selected fisheries regulations.},

Title = {Overlapping identities: The role of village and occupational group for
   smalls-cale fishers' perceptions on environment and governance},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {96},

Abstract = {Resource users' perceptions are crucial for successful marine governance
   because they affect community support, participation and legitimacy.
   Efforts have been made to understand how fishers' attitudes,
   understandings and interpretations of the environment and its governance
   emerge in small-scale fisheries. However, many quantitative studies have
   focused on how individual-level attributes like socio-demographics are
   associated with perceptions, ignoring a fundamental scale at which
   humans arrive at their views about the world the - social group. In
   multi-gear fisheries, fishers typically cluster in two overlapping types
   of group: occupational groups (defined by fishing gear) and village
   communities. Taking into account also individual-level variables, which
   group type is more associated with particular environmental and
   governance perceptions, e.g. about change in fish stocks, collective
   action or appropriate management actions? Through questionnaires in
   combination with multivariate and multi-model inference, this study
   reveals that, among fishers in two villages in Zanzibar (n = 172),
   village is more associated with perceptions than occupational group or
   any other factor. Further, individual attributes like education and age
   influence perceptions. The main finding implies that the role of social
   cultural processes might have been underestimated in quantitative
   research on research users' perceptions. This has consequences for
   policy and research and shows that both can be informed by statistical
   analyses that disentangles effects of different levels of group
   belonging.},

Title = {Participation in devolved commons management: Multiscale socioeconomic
   factors related to individuals' participation in community-based
   management of marine protected areas in Indonesia},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {61},
Pages = {212-220},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Management of common-pool natural resources is commonly implemented
   under institutional models promoting devolved decision-making, such as
   co-management and community-based management. Although participation of
   local people is critical to the success of devolved commons management,
   few studies have empirically investigated how individuals' participation
   is related to socioeconomic factors that operate at multiple scales.
   Here, we evaluated how individual- and community-scale factors were
   related to levels of individual participation in management of
   community-based marine protected areas in Indonesia. In addressing this
   aim, we drew on multiple bodies of literature on human behaviour from
   economics and social science, including the social-ecological systems
   framework from the literature on common-pool resources, the theory of
   planned behaviour from social psychology, and public goods games from
   behavioural economics. We found three key factors related to level of
   participation of local people: subjective norms, structural elements of
   social capital, and nested institutions. There was also suggestive
   evidence that participation was related to people's cooperative
   behavioural disposition, which we elicited using a public goods game.
   These results point to the importance of considering socioeconomic
   factors that operate at multiple scales when examining individual
   behaviour. Further, our study highlights the need to consider multiscale
   mechanisms other than those designed to appeal to self interested
   concerns, such as regulations and material incentives, which are
   typically employed in devolved commons management to encourage
   participation. Increased understanding of the factors related to
   participation could facilitate better targeting of investments aimed at
   encouraging cooperative management. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {This chapter analyzes the contribution of Participative Management Plans
   (PMP) for the identification of ecosystem services and the protection of
   conservation objects from the multiple-use protected coastal marine
   areas (MU-CMPA). The objective of these areas is to conserve the natural
   capital and cultural patrimony without restricting traditional
   productive activities such as fishing, mollusks and algae extraction,
   and energy resources. There are ten MU-CMPAs areas in Chile, but their
   implementation has been slow and 14 years after the first areas were
   legally declared, some of them still do not have management plans. Here
   we analyze the experiences of Isla Grande de Atacama MU-CMPA (MU-CMPA
   IGA) in the north of Chile, including the complexities of implementing
   PMPs and the challenges and opportunities of generating an ecosystem
   perspective in the management plans for protected areas. Administrative
   problems and conflicts of interest have worn social relationships
   generating little community participation regarding the design of a
   management plan. Nevertheless, there is a consensus among local social
   actors about the benefits of the ecosystems of the MU-CMPA IGA due to
   the high economic and social values given by the community to the
   services provided by the area.},

   systematic review},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {185},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Integrated approaches to engage coastal communities in management are
   urgently needed to address coastal change and associated uncertainty.
   Towards this aim, understanding the complex relationships between
   coastal well-being and ecosystem services provides a foundation for a
   range of management and governance interventions. While these
   relationships are considered in a growing number of case-based studies,
   the complexity of these linkages has not been comprehensively assessed.
   We use a systematic review protocol of 50 articles published between
   2008 and 2018 to assess the evidence about the interplay among coastal
   well-being and ecosystem services. We find that empirical research has
   fallen behind theoretical development in five key areas: 1) geographic
   diversity; 2) disaggregated data; 3) temporal dynamics; 4)
   co-production, and; 5) uncertainty of outcomes. We highlight these gaps
   as frontiers for interdisciplinary coastal well-being and ecosystem
   service research. Together, the five frontiers chart a potential new
   research agenda for coastal well-being and ecosystem services research,
   namely one that involves more cases and authors from the Global South,
   that explicitly explores social differentiation and changes overtime,
   that is collaborative from the start, and that engages empirically with
   the complexity and uncertainty of well-being-ecosystem service
   interactions and their implications for enhancing management. Our
   proposed agenda is vital to inform management that effectively supports
   the health and sustainability of coastal social-ecological systems.},

   California, Mexico},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {116},
Pages = {116-131},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Marine and coastal protected areas (MCPAs) are complex social-ecological
   systems. In recent decades, stakeholder participation has been widely
   encouraged in MCPA design and management strategy to enable these
   conservation projects to last over time and produce the expected
   results. This paper will discuss stakeholder participation in three
   MCPAs in the south-western Gulf of California in Mexico: Cabo Pulmo
   National Park, Loreto Bay National Park and Archipelago Espiritu Santo
   National Park. It will use a qualitative approach (such as
   semi-structured interviews and observations) to analyze MCPA governance,
   along with a literature review of specialized and official government
   documents. Three phases will be studied: MCPA design, MCPA management
   plan creation and MCPA management board meetings. Results suggest that
   in the early 2010s, these protected areas were assigned a mixture of
   governance types: governance by government and shared governance.
   Certain actions show that park authorities, largely supported by
   environmental non-governmental organizations, have attempted to improve
   MCPA decision-making processes through a participative approach, but
   that there is unequal stakeholder participation in such initiatives. (C)

Title = {Positive Social-Ecological Feedbacks in Community-Based Conservation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Marine area-based conservation measures including no-take zones (areas
   with no fishing allowed) are often designed through lengthy processes
   that aim to optimize for ecological and social objectives. Their (semi)
   permanence generates high stakes in what seems like a one-shot game. In
   this paper, we theoretically and empirically explore a model of
   short-term area-based conservation that prioritizes adaptive
   co-management: temporary areas closed to fishing, designed by the
   fishers they affect, approved by the government, and adapted every 5
   years. In this model, no-take zones are adapted through learning and
   trust-building between fishers and government fisheries scientists. We
   use integrated social-ecological theory and a case study of a network of
   such fisheries closures ({''}fishing refugia{''}) in northwest Mexico to
   hypothesize a feedback loop between trust, design, and ecological
   outcomes. We argue that, with temporary and adaptive area-based
   management, social and ecological outcomes can be mutually reinforcing
   as long as initial designs are ecologically ``good enough{''} and
   supported in the social-ecological context. This type of adaptive
   management also has the potential to adapt to climate change and other
   social-ecological changes. This feedback loop also predicts the
   dangerous possibility that low trust among stakeholders may lead to poor
   design, lack of ecological benefits, eroding confidence in the tool's
   capacity, shrinking size, and even lower likelihood of social-ecological
   benefits. In our case, however, this did not occur, despite poor
   ecological design of some areas, likely due to buffering by social
   network effects and alternative benefits. We discuss both the potential
   and the danger of temporary area-based conservation measures as a
   learning tool for adaptive co-management and commoning.},

Year = {2009},
Volume = {18},
Number = {4},
Pages = {935-956},

Abstract = {Climate change is posing new challenges to conservation because
   management policies on protected coral reefs are less effective than
   they were before the current ecosystem degradation. Coral reefs, the
   most diverse and complex marine ecosystem provide economic services for
   millions, but are seriously threatened worldwide because reef-building
   corals are experiencing bleaching phenomena and a steady decline in
   abundance. The resources of a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Cartagena,
   Colombia, are in constant decline, despite a current management plan and
   on-site staff, urging new conservation actions. A multidisciplinary team
   gathered to evaluate management effectiveness including biophysical,
   socioeconomic and governance indicators. Coral cover and fish diversity
   and abundance were low both inside and outside the MPA, which suggests a
   limited efficiency of management. Currently, the MPA is a reef with low
   coral cover and high algae cover as well as large dead coral areas,
   which are generally signs of highly degraded reef habitats. Live coral
   cover in the MPA was represented by pioneer coral species such as
   Agaricia tenuifolia and Porites astreoides. Nonetheless, 35\% of the
   scleractinian species sampled in the area harbored more than one
   zooxanthellae symbiont, which suggests potential resistance and
   resilience against coral bleaching. Maintenance of trophic structure and
   functional diversity is an important endeavor that should be a priority
   for management in order to allow ecosystem resilience. Social and
   governance indicators showed low-income levels and few opportunities for
   communities living in and around the park, low governability, weak
   communication among stakeholders and with authorities at different
   levels. As a result, problems related to over exploitation of resources
   were commonplace in the MPA. These results reflect low adaptive capacity
   of communities to comply with restrictive conservation rules, showing
   that establishment of a protected area is a necessary but insufficient
   condition to guarantee conservation goals. Ignoring the role of local
   communities only will exacerbate the problems associated with natural
   resources. Involvement of communities in strategic ecosystems management
   appears to be a requisite to improve effectiveness of protected areas,
   and participatory strategies, such as co-management, offer opportunities
   to improve governability while letting communities adapt to MPA needs.},

Title = {Periodic closures as adaptive coral reef management in the Indo-Pacific},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This study explores the social, economic, and ecological context within
   which communities in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia use adaptive coral
   reef management. We tested whether periodic closures had positive
   effects on reef resources, and found that both the biomass and the
   average size of fishes commonly caught in Indo-Pacific subsistence
   fisheries were greater inside areas subject to periodic closures
   compared to sites with year-round open access. Surprisingly, both
   long-lived and short-lived species benefited from periodic closures. Our
   study sites were remote communities that shared many socioeconomic
   characteristics; these may be crucial to the effectiveness of adaptive
   management of reef resources through periodic closures. Some of these
   factors include exclusive tenure over marine resources, a body of
   traditional ecological knowledge that allows for the rapid assessment of
   resource conditions, social customs that facilitate compliance with
   closures, relatively small human populations, negligible migration, and
   a relatively low dependence on fisheries. This dynamic adaptive
   management system, in which communities manage their resources among
   multiple social and ecological baselines, contrasts with western
   fisheries management practices, centered on maintaining exploited
   populations at stable levels in which net production is maximized.},

Title = {Communities and change in the anthropocene: understanding
   social-ecological vulnerability and planning adaptations to multiple
   interacting exposures},
Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Pages = {907-926},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The majority of vulnerability and adaptation scholarship, policies and
   programs focus exclusively on climate change or global environmental
   change. Yet, individuals, communities and sectors experience a broad
   array of multi-scalar and multi-temporal, social, political, economic
   and environmental changes to which they are vulnerable and must adapt.
   While extensive theoretical-and increasingly empirical-work suggests the
   need to explore multiple exposures, a clear conceptual framework which
   would facilitate analysis of vulnerability and adaptation to multiple
   interacting socioeconomic and biophysical changes is lacking. This
   review and synthesis paper aims to fill this gap through presenting a
   conceptual framework for integrating multiple exposures into
   vulnerability analysis and adaptation planning. To support applications
   of the framework and facilitate assessments and comparative analyses of
   community vulnerability, we develop a comprehensive typology of drivers
   and exposures experienced by coastal communities. Our results reveal
   essential elements of a pragmatic approach for local-scale vulnerability
   analysis and for planning appropriate adaptations within the context of
   multiple interacting exposures. We also identify methodologies for
   characterizing exposures and impacts, exploring interactions and
   identifying and prioritizing responses. This review focuses on coastal
   communities; however, we believe the framework, typology and approach
   will be useful for understanding vulnerability and planning adaptation
   to multiple exposures in various social-ecological contexts.},

Title = {Offshore renewable energy and nature conservation: the case of marine
   tidal turbines in Northern Ireland},
Journal = {BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {7, SI},
Pages = {1619-1638},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The global demand for renewable energy continues to increase rapidly and
   with it the necessity to develop and test new technologies to deliver
   the power. Offshore renewable energy sources that harness wind, wave or
   tidal power are of major interest. Technological advances in these
   directions have not been matched by a clear understanding of the
   environmental impacts of the new devices, with most existing research
   concentrated on the impacts of offshore wind farms. Decisions often
   continue to be made without the support of a clear evidence base. Here
   we use an underwater tidal turbine, SeaGen, constructed and operated
   within the Strangford Lough marine protected area in Northern Ireland,
   as a case study to explore the potential impacts of the turbine as
   points of concern and argumentation in the decision-making processes. We
   use information obtained from official documents and one-to-one
   interviews with the main stakeholders. Our results demonstrate that
   during the construction and operation of the turbine the perceptions and
   views of different stakeholders sometimes disagreed but were often
   surprisingly similar in relation to both likelihood and intensity of the
   potential impacts of the turbine on marine biodiversity, ecosystem
   services and human well-being in general. The overall consensus of views
   was refined and evolved under an adaptive management approach over the
   10 years of the discussions and decision-making processes. The results
   are discussed in relation to cumulative gains in knowledge, future
   arrays of many underwater turbines and multiple use of oceans within
   social ecological systems to maintain the conservation of marine
   biodiversity.},

Title = {Governing large-scale social-ecological systems: Lessons from five cases},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {428-456},
Abstract = {This paper compares lessons drawn from five case studies of large scale
   governance of common-pool resources: management of forests in Indonesia,
   the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the Rhine River in western Europe,
   the Ozone layer (i.e. the Montreal Protocol), and the Atlantic Bluefin
   Tuna (i.e. the International Convention on the Conservation of Atlantic
   Tuna). The goal is to assess the applicability of Ostrom's design
   principles for sustainable resource governance to large scale systems,
   as well as to examine other important variables that may determine
   success in large scale systems. While we find support for some of
   Ostrom's design principles (boundaries, monitoring, sanctions, fit to
   conditions, and conflict resolution mechanisms are all supported), other
   principles have only moderate to weak support. In particular,
   recognition of rights to organize and the accountability of monitors to
   resource users were not supported. We argue that these differences are
   the result of differences between small and large scale systems. At
   large scales, other kinds of political dynamics, including the role of
   scientists and civil society organizations, appear to play key roles.
   Other variables emphasized in common-pool resource studies, such as
   levels of dependence on resources, group size, heterogeneity,
   disturbances, and resource characteristics also receive mixed support,
   pointing to the need to reinterpret the meaning of common-pool resource
   theories in order for them to be applicable at larger scales.},

Abstract = {Small-scale fisheries are important for preventing poverty, sustaining
   local economies, and rural livelihoods, but tend to be negatively
   impacted by traditional forms of management and overexploitation among
   other factors. Marine Areas for Responsible Fishing (Areas Marinas de
   Pesca Responsable, AMPR) have emerged as a new model for the
   co-management of small-scale fisheries in Costa Rica, one that involves
   collaboration between fishers, government agencies, and NGOs. The
   primary objective of this paper is to elucidate some of the key
   variables that influence collective action among small-scale fishers in
   Tarcoles, a community in the Gulf of Nicoya. We examined collective
   action for the formation of a local marketing cooperative and
   participation in management through the AMPR. We apply the
   social-ecological framework as a diagnostic and organizational tool in
   the analysis of several types of qualitative data, including interviews
   with key informants, informal interviews, legal documents, and gray
   literature. Findings illustrate the importance of socio-economic
   community attributes (e.g., group size, homogeneity, previous
   cooperation), as well as that of social (e.g., equity) and ecological
   (e.g., improved stocks) outcomes perceived as favorable by actors. In
   addition, our work demonstrates the importance of certain kinds of
   external NGOs for facilitating and sustaining collective action.},

Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {902-911},

Abstract = {Coastal and ocean planning comprises a broad field of practice. The
   goals, political processes, and approaches applied to planning
   initiatives may vary widely. However, all planning processes ultimately
   require adequate information on both the biophysical and social
   attributes of a planning region. In coastal and ocean planning practice,
   there are well-established methods to assess biophysical attributes;
   however, less is understood about the role and assessment of social
   data. We conducted the first global assessment of the incorporation of
   social data in coastal and ocean planning. We drew on a comprehensive
   review of planning initiatives and a survey of coastal and ocean
   practitioners. There was significantly more incorporation of social data
   in multiuse versus conservation-oriented planning. Practitioners engaged
   a wide range of social data, including governance, economic, and
   cultural attributes of planning regions and human impacts data. Less
   attention was given to ecosystem services and social-ecological
   linkages, both of which could improve coastal and ocean planning
   practice. Although practitioners recognize the value of social data,
   little funding is devoted to its collection and incorporation in plans.
   Increased capacity and sophistication in acquiring critical social and
   ecological data for planning is necessary to develop plans for more
   resilient coastal and ocean ecosystems and communities. We suggest that
   improving social data monitoring, and in particular spatial social data,
   to complement biophysical data, is necessary for providing holistic
   information for decision-support tools and other methods. Moving beyond
   people as impacts to people as beneficiaries, through ecosystem services
   assessments, holds much potential to better incorporate the tenets of
   ecosystem-based management into coastal and ocean planning by providing
   targets for linked biodiversity conservation and human welfare outcomes.},

   are in similar geographical and administrative settings but differ in
   their proximity to Park headquarters, conformity to Park regulations and
   engagement in fish trade. Data were collected through in-depth
   interviews, focus group discussions, direct observation and
   questionnaire surveys. Interviewees from both villages reported
   increasing poverty in terms of reduced capacity to meet their basic
   needs, and decreases in numbers of meals per day, variety of foods and
   fish consumption, reduced access to resources, low productivity and
   prices of local produce. Women experienced raised household
   responsibilities for food security and meeting other household needs.
   Their main responses to these changes included loan seeking, reduction
   of expenditures, skipping meals, selling assets, collective fishing,
   livelihoods diversification, change of fishing techniques and gears,
   abandoning of fishing activity and outward migration. Their responses
   only contributed to survival without resolving the challenges. Paying
   attention to these societal experiences is therefore necessary, if
   resilience of socialecological systems in a marine conservation area is
   to be maintained or enhanced.},

Abstract = {Coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) are complex, dynamic,
   interconnected systems with feedback across social and environmental
   dimensions. This feedback leads to formidable challenges for causal
   inference. Two significant challenges involve assumptions about
   excludability and the absence of interference. These two assumptions
   have been largely unexplored in the CHANS literature, but when either is
   violated, causal inferences from observable data are difficult to
   interpret. To explore their plausibility, structural knowledge of the
   system is requisite, as is an explicit recognition that most causal
   variables in CHANS affect a coupled pairing of environmental and human
   elements. In a large CHANS literature that evaluates marine protected
   areas, nearly 200 studies attempt to make causal claims, but few address
   the excludability assumption. To examine the relevance of interference
   in CHANS, we develop a stylized simulation of a marine CHANS with shocks
   that can represent policy interventions, ecological disturbances, and
   technological disasters. Human and capital mobility in CHANS is both a
   cause of interference, which biases inferences about causal effects, and
   a moderator of the causal effects themselves. No perfect solutions exist
   for satisfying excludability and interference assumptions in CHANS. To
   elucidate causal relationships in CHANS, multiple approaches will be
   needed for a given causal question, with the aim of identifying sources
   of bias in each approach and then triangulating on credible inferences.
   Within CHANS research, and sustainability science more generally, the
   path to accumulating an evidence base on causal relationships requires
   skills and knowledge from many disciplines and effective
   academic-practitioner collaborations.},

Title = {People, Power, and the Coast: a Conceptual Framework for Understanding
   and Implementing Benefit Sharing},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The concept of benefit sharing has seen growing adoption in recent years
   by a variety of sectors. However, its conceptual underpinnings,
   definitions, and framework remain poorly articulated and developed. We
   aim to help address this gap by presenting a new conceptual approach for
   enhancing understanding about benefit sharing and its implementation. We
   use the coast as a lens through which the analysis is framed because of
   the intricate governance challenges which coastal social-ecological
   systems present, the increasing development and exploitation pressures
   on these systems, and the growing need to improve understanding about
   the way in which greater equity and reduced inequalities could reduce
   conflicts, protect coastal ecosystems, and ensure greater social
   justice. Key elements of the framework include the range of actors
   involved, the natural resources they access and use, the interventions
   introduced to redistribute benefits, and the benefits and losses that
   result from these interventions. The framework underscores the
   importance of process in determining who gets what, as well as the wider
   institutional, political, social, and economic context. Power relations
   and imbalances underpin many of these elements and remain the central
   reason for benefits being distributed in the way that they are. The
   framework has relevance and application for coastal livelihoods, rural
   governance, and resource sustainability in a context in which community
   rights are increasingly undermined through land grabbing, unequal power
   relations, and externally driven development interventions.},

Title = {Linking ecological condition to enforcement of marine protected area
   regulations in the greater Caribbean region},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {62},
Pages = {186-195},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly employed worldwide to
   conserve marine resources. However, information on the role of
   governance mechanisms, in particular those associated with compliance,
   in shaping ecological condition inside MPAs at the regional scale
   remains deficient. An exploratory data analysis was conducted to
   evaluate links between strategies used to promote compliance with MPA
   regulations (e.g. incentives and penalties) and indicators of ecological
   condition, including biomass and density of commercial fish species,
   fish functional groups and coral cover in 21 MPAs across 13 different
   countries and territories in the greater Caribbean region. The
   strategies used to promote compliance with MPA regulations were
   correlated with indicators of ecological condition. For example, MPAs in
   which a larger number of incentives and penalties are present in the
   governance system are associated with higher commercial fish biomass and
   density as compared to those with fewer penalties and incentives
   available to promote compliance. Although most MPAs in the greater
   Caribbean use penalties to enforce compliance, these results suggest
   incentives may also be an important governance strategy for ensuring
   efficacy of protected areas in conserving key species. Alternatively,
   the presence of a high number of penalties and incentives in governance
   systems may also be indicative of greater state capacity and political
   will in these MPAs resulting in better managed MPAs. Further research is
   necessary to evaluate results of the exploratory data analysis presented
   in this study with a more in depth analysis of the de facto use of the
   regulations evaluated and their efficacy. Multi-country comparisons of
   MPA governance and ecological indicators can help policy and decision
   makers maintain MPAs that most effectively achieve MPA conservation
   objectives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Mapping outdoor recreationists' perceived social values for ecosystem

Volume = {35},

Abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are increasingly faced with human impacts. To better
   understand these changing conditions, biophysical and economic values of
   nature have been used to prioritize spatial planning efforts and
   ecosystem-based management of human activities. Less is known, however,
   about how to characterize and represent non-material values in
   decision-making. We collected on-site and mailback survey data (n =
   209), and analyzed these data using the Social Values for Ecosystem
   Services (SolVES) GIS application to incorporate measures of social
   value and natural resource conditions on Hinchinbrook Island National
   Park, Australia. Our objectives in this paper are to: I) determine the
   spatial distribution and point density of social values for ecosystem
   services; 2) examine the relationship between social values and natural
   resource conditions; and 3) compare social value allocations between two
   subgroups of outdoor recreationists. Results suggest that high priority
   areas exist on Hinchinbrook's land and seascapes according to the
   multiple values assigned to places by outdoor recreationists engaged in
   consumptive (e.g., fishing) and non-consumptive (e.g., hiking)
   activities. We examine statistically significant spatial clustering
   across two subgroups of the survey population for three value types that
   reflect Recreation, Biological Diversity, and Aesthetic qualities. The
   relationship between the relative importance of social values for
   ecosystem services and spatially-defined ecological data is explored to
   guide management decision-making in the context of an island national
   park setting. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Scale Mismatches, Conservation Planning, and the Value of Social-Network
   Analyses},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-44},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Many of the challenges conservation professionals face can be framed as
   scale mismatches. The problem of scale mismatch occurs when the planning
   for and implementation of conservation actions is at a scale that does
   not reflect the scale of the conservation problem. The challenges in
   conservation planning related to scale mismatch include ecosystem or
   ecological process transcendence of governance boundaries; limited
   availability of fine-resolution data; lack of operational capacity for
   implementation; lack of understanding of social-ecological system
   components; threats to ecological diversity that operate at diverse
   spatial and temporal scales; mismatch between funding and the long-term
   nature of ecological processes; rate of action implementation that does
   not reflect the rate of change of the ecological system; lack of
   appropriate indicators for monitoring activities; and occurrence of
   ecological change at scales smaller or larger than the scale of
   implementation or monitoring. Not recognizing and accounting for these
   challenges when planning for conservation can result in actions that do
   not address the multiscale nature of conservation problems and that do
   not achieve conservation objectives. Social networks link organizations
   and individuals across space and time and determine the scale of
   conservation actions; thus, an understanding of the social networks
   associated with conservation planning will help determine the potential
   for implementing conservation actions at the required scales.
   Social-network analyses can be used to explore whether these networks
   constrain or enable key social processes and how multiple scales of
   action are linked. Results of network analyses can be used to mitigate
   scale mismatches in assessing, planning, implementing, and monitoring
   conservation projects.},

Title = {Quantitative decision support tools facilitate social-ecological
   alignment in community-based marine protected area design},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly used to support both
   biodiversity conservation and fisheries management. However, MPA
   performance is likely to be compromised if people who depend on fishing
   are excluded from MPA design decision making. Participatory MPA design
   helps to address this problem by engaging local stakeholders in all
   critical decisions, including the total coverage, placement, and local
   size of no-take marine reserves. Here, we report the findings from a
   participatory MPA design project on Selayar Island, Indonesia, in which
   a community initiated collaborations with scientists to access modern
   quantitative tools for community-led MPA scenario testing. The outcomes
   highlight a local disagreement between ecologically and socially
   desirable MPA designs. Focused on social considerations, the initial
   community-supported MPA design consisted of four small reserves (0.5-1
   km wide) in predominately southern community waters, where they were
   intended to restrict external fishers. Ecologically optimal MPA designs,
   in contrast, consisted of one or two large reserves (4-6 km wide) in
   northern community waters, where they were expected to restrict
   primarily local fishers but better support the rebuilding of fish
   populations and fisheries. However, ecologically optimal MPA designs
   were socially infeasible. Using quantitative MPA performance
   assessments, the community negotiated an alternative MPA design
   consisting of two 1.5-2 km wide reserves at socially and ecologically
   favorable locations. Compared to the initial proposal, this revised MPA
   design was estimated (1) to protect three to four times more individuals
   of key fishery species within reserve boundaries and (2) to double local
   fishery catches. We conclude that even simple MPA design tools, which
   quantify and visualize local conservation and fishery outcomes under
   alternative MPA scenarios, add value to participatory decision making
   and likely MPA performance.},

Title = {An interdisciplinary evaluation of community-based TURF-reserves},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 23},
Abstract = {Coastal marine ecosystems provide livelihoods for small-scale fishers
   and coastal communities around the world. Small-scale fisheries face
   great challenges since they are difficult to monitor, enforce, and
   manage, which may lead to overexploitation. Combining territorial use
   rights for fisheries (TURF) with no-take marine reserves to create
   TURF-reserves can improve the performance of small-scale fisheries by
   buffering fisheries from environmental variability and management
   errors, while ensuring that fishers reap the benefits of conservation
   investments. Since 2012, 18 old and new community-based Mexican
   TURF-reserves gained legal recognition thanks to a regulation passed in
   2012; their effectiveness has not been formally evaluated. We combine
   causal inference techniques and the Social-Ecological Systems framework
   to provide a holistic evaluation of community-based TURF-reserves in
   three coastal communities in Mexico. We find that, overall, reserves
   have not yet achieved their stated goals of increasing the density of
   lobster and other benthic invertebrates, nor increasing lobster catches.
   A lack of clear ecological and socioeconomic effects likely results from
   a combination of factors. First, some of these reserves might be too
   young for the effects to show (reserves were 6-10 years old). Second,
   the reserves are not large enough to protect mobile species, like
   lobster. Third, variable and extreme oceanographic conditions have
   impacted harvested populations. Fourth, local fisheries are already well
   managed, and while reserves may protect populations within its
   boundaries, it is unlikely that reserves might have a detectable effect
   in catches. However, even small reserves are expected to provide
   benefits for sedentary invertebrates over longer time frames, with
   continued protection. These reserves may provide a foundation for
   establishing additional, larger marine reserves needed to effectively
   conserve mobile species.},

Title = {Evaluating the social and ecological effectiveness of partially
   protected marine areas},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Pages = {921-932},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are a primary tool for the stewardship,
   conservation, and restoration of marine ecosystems, yet 69\% of global
   MPAs are only partially protected (i.e., are open to some form of
   fishing). Although fully protected areas have well-documented outcomes,
   including increased fish diversity and biomass, the effectiveness of
   partially protected areas is contested. Partially protected areas may
   provide benefits in some contexts and may be warranted for social
   reasons, yet social outcomes often depend on MPAs achieving their
   ecological goals to distinguish them from open areas and justify the
   cost of protection. We assessed the social perceptions and ecological
   effectiveness of 18 partially protected areas and 19 fully protected
   areas compared with 19 open areas along 7000 km of coast of southern
   Australia. We used mixed methods, gathering data via semistructured
   interviews, site surveys, and Reef Life (underwater visual census)
   surveys. We analyzed qualitative data in accordance with grounded theory
   and quantitative data with multivariate and univariate linear
   mixed-effects models. We found no social or ecological benefits for
   partially protected areas relative to open areas in our study. Partially
   protected areas had no more fish, invertebrates, or algae than open
   areas; were poorly understood by coastal users; were not more attractive
   than open areas; and were not perceived to have better marine life than
   open areas. These findings provide an important counterpoint to some
   large-scale meta-analyses that conclude partially protected areas can be
   ecologically effective but that draw this conclusion based on narrower
   measures. We argue that partially protected areas act as red herrings in
   marine conservation because they create an illusion of protection and
   consume scarce conservation resources yet provide little or no social or
   ecological gain over open areas. Fully protected areas, by contrast,
   have more fish species and biomass and are well understood, supported,
   and valued by the public. They are perceived to have better marine life
   and be improving over time in keeping with actual ecological results.
   Conservation outcomes can be improved by upgrading partially protected
   areas to higher levels of protection including conversion to fully
   protected areas.},

Title = {Trade-Offs in Values Assigned to Ecological Goods and Services
   Associated with Different Coral Reef Management Strategies},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Societies value ecosystems and the services they provide in a number of
   ways. These values can help inform the management of ecosystems such as
   coral reefs. However, the trade-offs in ecosystem goods and services
   associated with different social and management conditions are poorly
   understood. Consequently, we examined values assigned to the goods and
   services identified across three types of management on the Kenyan
   coast: (1) a government-imposed no-take area in the Mombasa Marine
   National Park; (2) co-management of gear between fishing communities and
   the government's fisheries department; and (3) community-initiated
   no-take area management, where a community independently initiated and
   controlled a small closed area. We compared the ecosystem goods and
   services and the broader total economic value to explore how the history
   of these sites, their social conditions, and different management
   choices were associated with these values. The highest total economic
   values were associated with government management interventions and were
   probably due to the government's priority to be involved in the
   high-value beach tourism destinations. This is, however, associated with
   losses in a range of local community-level values and the social capital
   of the resource-user community. For example, resource users near the
   government marine protected area had the lowest value for measures of
   biological knowledge. Sites displaying greater community-level values
   were characterized by high social capital, and users had the most
   confidence in their ability to manage the resource. This study suggests
   that trade-offs occur in values associated with the interests and
   responsibilities of the management. The ability to cope with disturbance
   and change will depend on these values and responsibilities, and local
   communities are less likely to respond when government management and
   interests are strong.},

Abstract = {Triple-bottom-line outcomes from resource management and conservation,
   where conservation goals and equity in social outcomes are maximized
   while overall costs are minimized, remain a highly sought-after ideal.
   However, despite widespread recognition of the importance that equitable
   distribution of benefits or costs across society can play in
   conservation success, little formal theory exists for how to explicitly
   incorporate equity into conservation planning and prioritization. Here,
   we develop that theory and implement it for three very different case
   studies in California (United States), Raja Ampat (Indonesia), and the
   wider Coral Triangle region (Southeast Asia). We show that equity tends
   to trade off nonlinearly with the potential to achieve conservation
   objectives, such that similar conservation outcomes can be possible with
   greater equity, to a point. However, these case studies also produce a
   range of trade-off typologies between equity and conservation, depending
   on how one defines and measures social equity, including direct (linear)
   and no trade-off. Important gaps remain in our understanding, most
   notably how equity influences probability of conservation success, in
   turn affecting the actual ability to achieve conservation objectives.
   Results here provide an important foundation for moving the science and
   practice of conservation planning and broader spatial planning in
   general toward more consistently achieving efficient, equitable, and
   effective outcomes.},

Abstract = {This study analyzed the governance of the Cassuruba Extractive Reserve
   or RESEX in Bahia State, Brazil, exploring the favorable conditions and
   the difficulties faced by this newly established and complex governance
   system. RESEXS are protected areas that involve traditional communities
   in its administration through majority representation in a Deliberative
   Council (DC). Research was conducted through literature and documents
   review, participant observation through direct involvement in community
   activities along several years (20082016), and semi-structured and
   structured interviews applied respectively to members of the DC and to
   users of the RESEX during 2012 and 2013. The Institutional Design
   Principles were used as an analytical tool to reflect on the strengths,
   limitations, and the multiple factors affecting its governance.
   Interview results suggest a more negative perception of resource users
   about RESEX functioning and prospects than DC members. Participation of
   resource users in RESEX meetings was low and a passive performance of
   council members was observed. Since 2012-2013, participation of users
   and council members has been gradually increasing. Several of the design
   principles were found to be present (boundaries, congruence, collective

Abstract = {We describe a decision support system that has been developed to inform
   management and planning in a portion of the St. Lawrence Estuary in
   Canada (covering the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park and the proposed
   St. Lawrence Estuary Marine Protected Area). The system is composed of a
   spatiotemporal, georeferenced database, a simulator (3MTSim) that
   reproduces the spatiotemporal movement of marine mammals and maritime
   traffic in the estuary, and data post-processing tools that can be used
   to analyse the output of 3MTSim. 3MTSim allows users to test different
   management scenarios for maritime traffic (e.g., area closures, speed
   limits, regulations concerning the observation of marine mammals) in
   order to assess their effects on navigational patterns which may
   influence marine mammal exposure to vessels. 3MTSim includes an
   individual-based model of marine mammal movement patterns that has been
   elaborated based on existing telemetry data on fin, blue, and beluga
   whales as well as on land-based theodolite tracking of humpback and
   minke whales. Observations recorded aboard research and whale-watching
   vessels have provided the spatial data necessary to estimate species'
   abundances and distribution maps that are used to initialise the whale
   model. Different types of vessels, including cargo ships and commercial
   whale-watching boats are also modelled individually, using an
   agent-based approach. The boat model represents the decision-making
   process of boat captains as a function of environmental conditions, the
   contextual setting, and their respective goals. An extensive database of
   real-time tracking data available for the different types of vessels,
   coupled with observations and interviews, has served in the elaboration
   of the boat model. In this paper, an overview of the entire system is
   presented and its effectiveness as a decision support tool is
   demonstrated via the results from a sample of scenario-based
   simulations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {When push comes to shove in recreational fishing compliance, think
   `nudge'},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {95},
Pages = {256-266},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Enforcing compliance with rules and regulations in recreational
   fisheries has proved difficult due to factors such as the high number of
   participants and costs of enforcement, the absence of regular monitoring
   of recreational fishing activity, and the inherent difficulties in
   accurately determining catch levels. The effectiveness of traditional
   punitive deterrence is limited, yet current management is heavily
   reliant on this compliance approach. In this paper, the potential of
   behavioural based management is considered through a narrative review of
   the relevant literature; specifically, exploring the use of nudges,
   which aim through subtle changes and indirect suggestion to make certain
   decisions more salient, thereby improving voluntary compliance. This
   concept is explored with specific reference to the compliance of fishers
   within Australian recreational fisheries. There are only a few examples
   of behavioural based approaches found. However, based on their
   theoretical foundations, nudges may represent an inexpensive, and
   potentially highly effective tool for recreational fisheries management.
   Nudges do not offer a `quick fix' to cases where traditional policy
   instruments have failed. Rather, there is the potential for behavioural
   nudges (based on framing, changing the physical environment, presenting
   default options, and social norms) to augment and complement existing
   deterrence regimes. A number of potential nudges for compliance
   management in recreational fisheries are suggested, but caution is
   advised. As with any novel management approach, nudges must be
   rigorously tested to demonstrate their cost-effectiveness and to avoid
   unintended consequences.},

Title = {Quantifying local coastal stewardship reveals motivations, models and
   engagement strategies},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {249},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The human footprint on earth is now so great that we must become
   environmental stewards. To encourage stewardship and achieve better
   conservation outcomes, research is needed to connect practice with sound
   theory, and to empirically measure stewardship so we can identify its
   predictors and motivators.
   In this study, we use mixed methods to develop a new quantitative
   indicator for local environmental stewardship in a coastal context. We
   interviewed 111 people in eastern Australia about their knowledge and
   use of the coast and extracted information on seven generalised
   stewardship actions. We combined these into a single indicator which
   allowed us to evaluate and compare stewardship levels between
   participants and develop quantitative models. We found that stewardship
   was predicted by four traits: attraction to marine wildlife,
   self-identifying as local, size of local social network, and norms
   regarding informal enforcement. High-stewardship individuals exhibited
   eco-centric and anthropocentric worldviews and were motivated by a
   combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We combined these with
   stewardship actions in a refined model which highlights the importance
   of people, policy and place in environmental stewardship.
   We believe this is the first study to quantify stewardship behaviour and
   its motivating factors in a broad social-ecological context spanning
   both terrestrial and marine realms. Our research allows stewardship to
   be measured, modelled and analysed via a transferable indicator. This
   enables a deeper understanding of local environmental stewardship and
   the factors that predict and motivate it and allows us to propose
   practical strategies to engage people to improve stewardship and
   conservation outcomes.},

Title = {Crossing Science-Policy-Societal Boundaries to Reduce Scientific and
   Institutional Uncertainty in Small-Scale Fisheries},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {58},
Number = {4},
Pages = {565-584},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The governance of small-scale fisheries (SSF) is challenging due to the
   uncertainty, complexity, and interconnectedness of social, political,
   ecological, and economical processes. Conventional SSF management has
   focused on a centralized and top-down approach. A major criticism of
   conventional management is the over-reliance on `expert science' to
   guide decision-making and poor consideration of fishers' contextually
   rich knowledge. That is thought to exacerbate the already low governance
   potential of SSF. Integrating scientific knowledge with fishers'
   knowledge is increasingly popular and is often assumed to help reduce
   levels of biophysical and institutional uncertainties. Many projects
   aimed at encouraging knowledge integration have, however, been
   unsuccessful. Our objective in this research was to assess factors that
   influence knowledge integration and the uptake of integrated knowledge
   into policy-making. We report results from 54 semi-structured interviews
   with SSF researchers and practitioners from around the globe. Our
   analysis is framed in terms of scientific credibility, societal
   legitimacy, and policy saliency, and we discuss cases that have been
   partially or fully successful in reducing uncertainty via
   push-and-pull-oriented boundary crossing initiatives. Our findings
   suggest that two important factors affect the science-policy-societal
   boundary: a lack of consensus among stakeholders about what constitutes
   credible knowledge and institutional uncertainty resulting from shifting
   policies and leadership change. A lack of training for scientific
   leaders and an apparent `shelf-life' for community organizations
   highlight the importance of ongoing institutional support for knowledge
   integration projects. Institutional support may be enhanced through such
   investments, such as capacity building and specialized platforms for
   knowledge integration.},

Title = {Social Resilience and Commercial Fishers' Responses to Management
   Changes in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Understanding how social resilience influences resource users' responses
   to policy change is important for ensuring the sustainability of
   social-ecological systems and resource-dependent communities. We use the
   conceptualization and operationalization of social resilience proposed
   by Marshall and Marshall (2007) to investigate how resilience level
   influenced commercial fishers' perceptions about and adaptation to the
   2004 rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. We conducted
   face-to-face interviews with 114 commercial and charter fishers to
   measure their social resilience level and their responses and adaptation
   strategies to the 2004 zoning plan. Fishers with higher resilience were
   more likely to believe that the zoning plan was necessary, more likely
   to be supportive of the plan, and more likely to have adapted their
   fishing business and fishing activity to the plan than were fishers with
   lower social resilience. High-resilience fishers were also less likely
   to perceive negative impacts of the plan on their fishing business, less
   likely to have negative attitudes toward the consultation process used
   to develop and implement the plan, and less likely to have applied for
   financial compensation under the structural adjustment program. Results
   confirm the utility of the social resilience construct for identifying
   fishers who are likely to be vulnerable to changes, and those who are
   struggling to cope with change events. We conclude that managing for
   social resilience in the GBR would aid in the design and implementation
   of policies that minimize the impacts on resource users and lead to more
   inclusive and sustainable management, but that further research is
   necessary to better understand social resilience, how it can be fostered
   and sustained, and how it can be effectively incorporated into
   management.},

   fishing communities},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {108},
Pages = {56-66},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Climate change is expected to reinforce undesirable social and
   ecological feedbacks between ecosystem degradation and poverty. This is
   particularly true for resource-dependent communities in the developing
   world such as coral reef fishing communities who will have to adapt to
   those new environmental conditions and novel ecosystems. It is therefore
   crucial to identify: i) multiscale characteristics that can influence
   social adaptive capacity of local communities to climate change, and ii)
   current and future social-ecological conditions related to climate
   change that might lead communities to experience unsustainable and
   undesirable states (i.e., ``socialecological traps{''}). Here, we
   investigated social adaptive capacity and the relationship to ecological
   conditions in 29 small-scale fishing communities in Madagascar and Kenya
   in the Western Indian Ocean. We found that isolation from a market and
   climate stress had a significant negative relationship with social
   adaptive capacity, while a higher level of education and the presence of
   market traders (middlemen) had a positive relationship. In general,
   resource management through marine protected areas and locally managed
   marine areas had a positive influence on ecological conditions.
   Combining social adaptive capacity and ecological conditions revealed
   that 80 \% of fishers households surveyed were experiencing
   social-ecological states that could lead to unsustainable
   social-ecological conditions, while 10 \% might already be experiencing
   social-ecological traps. Our findings reveal specific mechanisms by
   which conservation and development activities can increase social
   adaptive capacity in coastal communities, including but not limited to:
   increasing market access and education, and mitigating future climate
   exposure and unsustainable fishing through improved marine conservation
   and management.},

Abstract = {In addition to the management of marine protected areas, the management
   of non-protected areas is integral to sustainable use and conservation
   of coastal zones. The human-nature connection has drawn increasing
   attention in the Western society because the disconnect from nature is a
   root cause of ecological crises and unsustainability. Re-connecting is a
   promising avenue. We propose satoumi creation as an approach for the
   sustainable use and conservation of coastal zones by re-connecting
   people to nature. Satoumi is a Japanese term describing a desirable
   state of coastal zones with enhanced biodiversity and productivity
   realized by active human intervention. Although satoumi is promising,
   previous discussions have been narrowly focused on ecosystems. We
   reconsidered satoumi from a social-ecological system (SES) perspective
   to elucidate the full spectrum of its key features. The human-nature
   connection is an integral part of satoumi. Satoumi engenders relational
   values in addition to instrumental and intrinsic values. Satoumi as a
   state is one thing and its creation another. We cannot merely transplant
   a successful satoumi to other locations. Furthermore, because coastal
   SESs are complex, systemic transformation into satoumi requires
   identifying deep leverage points. We propose a certain marine education
   at schools that could function as a deep leverage point. The education
   corresponds to the three realms of deep leverage for sustainability
   transformation: re-structure, re-connect and re-think.

Title = {Environmental (in)justice in the Anthropocene ocean},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {147},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Environmental justice refers broadly to the distribution of
   environmental benefits and burdens, and the fair treatment and
   meaningful involvement of all people in environmental decision-making
   and legal frameworks. The field of environmental justice initially
   developed out of a concern for the disproportionate distribution and
   impacts of environmental pollution and hazardous waste disposal on
   groups that have been historically and structurally marginalized,
   including Black populations and socio-economically disadvantaged
   communities. More recent environmental justice scholarship has expanded
   geographically and focused on a broader set of environmental hazards and
   harms, such as climate change impacts, biodiversity and habitat loss,
   and ecosystem service declines. Yet, the impacts and distribution of
   environmental hazards and harms in the marine environ-ment on coastal
   populations has received less attention in the environmental justice
   literature. This narrative review paper starts to address this gap
   through a focus on five main areas of environmental injustice in the
   ocean: 1) pollution and toxic wastes, 2) plastics and marine debris, 3)
   climate change, 4) ecosystem, biodiversity and ecosystem service
   degradation, and 5) fisheries declines. For each, we characterize the
   issue and root drivers, then examine social and distributional impacts.
   In the discussion, we explore how these environmental injustices are
   converging and interacting, cumulative, differentiated, and
   geographically distributed, and briefly examine solutions and future
   research directions. In conclusion, we call for greater and more
   explicit attention to envi-ronmental justice in ocean research and
   policy.},

Title = {Integration of biophysical connectivity in the spatial optimization of
   coastal ecosystem services},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {733},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Ecological connectivity in coastal oceanic waters is mediated by
   dispersion of the early life stages of marine organisms and conditions
   the structure of biological communities and the provision of ecosystem
   services. Integrated management strategies aimed at ensuring long-term
   service provision to society do not currently consider the importance of
   dispersal and larval connectivity. A spatial optimization model is
   introduced to maximise the potential provision of ecosystem services in
   coastal areas by accounting for the role of dispersal and larval
   connectivity. The approach combines a validated coastal circulation
   model that reproduces realistic patterns of larval transport along the
   coast, which ultimately conditions the biological connectivity and
   productivity of an area, with additional spatial layers describing
   potential ecosystem services. The spatial optimization exercise was
   tested along the coast of Central Chile, a highly productive area
   dominated by the Humboldt Current. Results show it is unnecessary to
   relocate existing management areas, as increasing no-take areas by 10\%
   could maximise ecosystem service provision, while improving the spatial
   representativeness of protected areas and minimizing social conflicts.
   The location of protected areas was underrepresented in some sections of
   the study domain. principally due to the restriction of the model to
   rocky subtidal habitats. Future model developments should encompass the
   diversity of coastal ecosystems and human activities to inform
   integrative spatial management. Nevertheless, the spatial optimization
   model is innovative not only for its integrated ecosystem perspective,
   but also because it demonstrates that it is possible to incorporate
   time-varying biophysical connectivity within the optimization problem,
   thereby linking the dynamics of exploited populations produced by the
   spatial management regime. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A social-ecological approach to estimate fisher resilience: a case study
   from Brazil},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Social-ecological systems (SESs), such as fishing communities, are human
   and biophysical subsystems that are intrinsically connected to one
   another and strongly depend on natural resources. That is why these
   human groups are usually the first to feel the effects of policies
   concerning fisheries and ocean governance and the most affected by them.
   These policies can potentially build or erode social-ecological
   resilience (SER), especially if they are coupled with environmental
   changes. SER assessments offer a valuable tool to identify human-nature
   linkages, and the implications and feedbacks in SESs when facing
   human-induced or natural changes. We created a SER index by combining
   interviews with fishers with environmental datasets on a fine scale that
   has never been presented for the Brazilian coast. This scale was then
   tested in marine protected areas that allow sustainable use. Our
   approach estimated SER from information on fisheries ecosystem services
   and adaptive capacity at the local scale, considering the individual and
   community levels. We synthesized blocks of critical indicators of an
   individual or community's ability to build and maintain resilience in
   SESs, such as flexibility, ability to learn, ability to organize,
   assets, social capital, and ecological characteristics. We identified
   that fishers' ability to learn and to organize, as well as the
   biological sensitivity of an ecosystem are determinant to enhancing SER
   in the studied coastal communities. A Bayesian model also showed that
   the fishers' SER was related to socioeconomic factors, thereby
   indicating that older fishers, fishers who consistently catch more fish,
   and fishers with a higher reliance on fishing for their income presented
   lower index values. By knowing the variables that influence the ability
   of fishers to cope with changes to their SESs, we can devise smarter
   management approaches that may include compensatory mechanisms for more
   fragile fishers. Our findings can also inform decision making about
   where fisheries management strategies are likely to be more
   participative and effective in order to minimize the social impacts of
   policy decisions and increase SER in coastal communities.},

   administrative scales. Text mining tools were used to identify key
   concepts and analyze the text of legal regulations on MRF in the
   European Union (EU), Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom (UK). Also,
   the Ecosystem Fisheries Legal Assessment (EFLA) framework was used to
   assess the alignment of the regulations with the EAF. The number of
   regulations about MRF in Spain and Portugal is higher than in the UK and
   the EU, probably because the relative higher importance of regional
   regulations in Spain and Portugal, and the limitations imposed to
   recreational fishers in marine protected areas (MPAs). The lack of
   specific regulations on MRF in the EU, and open-access in the UK for
   recreational fishers, except for Atlantic salmon Salmo solar, explain
   their lower number of regulations. The EFLA framework showed that the
   European public policies on MRF follow the EAF principles. Enough
   attention is payed to ecological components, but socio-economic
   sustainability could be improved. However, policy efficiency could be
   lower than expected because potential institutional misfits derived from
   the eventual confluence of different spatial scales.},

Title = {Using systematic conservation planning to align priority areas for
   biodiversity and nature-based activities in marine spatial planning: A
   real-world application in contested marine space},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {271},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {To support sustainable growth of ocean-based economies, many countries
   are engaging in marine spatial planning (MSP) processes, which require
   robust decision-support tools. Systematic conservation planning (SCP) is
   commonly used in decision-making to guide spatially efficient protected
   area expansion. Here we contend that SCP can also be used to streamline
   MSP negotiations by developing a coherent, integrated portfolio of sites
   for multiple sectors that depend on biodiversity being maintained in a
   good state, as a counterpoint to spatial priorities for those commercial
   and industrial activities that have negative environmental impacts. We
   demonstrate this in Algoa Bay, South Africa, given the social-ecological
   complexity of the bay, and its central location in the first national
   MSP process. In anticipation of this national process, a
   civil-society-led Community of Practice was established with a core team
   to lead stakeholder engagement, data acquisition and management, and SCP
   analyses. More than 500 stakeholders participated in the project and
   many contributed spatial data or engaged in expert-based participatory
   mapping. Spatial products were supplemented with existing, published
   datasets. Altogether, conservation targets were set for 115 biodiversity
   features and 22 nature-based activities, with the cost layer built from
   data on 10 commercial and industrial activities, cumulative pressures (n
   = 31) on ecosystems, and planning-unit area. All targets were met in
   15\% of the study area, of which only a third (4\%) was outside of
   marine protected areas, demonstrating that it is possible to align
   multi-sector priorities for intact biodiversity. This approach can be
   widely applied in MSP to support sustainable ocean economies.},

Title = {Socio-economic monitoring and evaluation in fisheries},
Journal = {FISHERIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {239},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Many fisheries policies, management processes, improvement projects and
   funding portfolios have explicit or implicit socio-economic development
   or human well-being objectives. Thus, it is common for decision-makers,
   managers, practitioners, and funders to want to monitor and evaluate the
   socio-economic or human wellbeing aspects of fisheries before, during
   and after management or programmatic interventions at scales ranging
   from local to national. While numerous frameworks have been developed
   that focus on socio-economic assessments in fisheries, there is no such
   thing as a one-size-fits-all approach. Socio-economic monitoring and
   evaluation processes should be designed to fit the specific context,
   analytical purpose, and objectives of the fisheries policy, management
   intervention, program, or investment being studied. Furthermore, these
   processes need to include clear plans for evaluation, communication,
   deliberation, and application of recommendations so that results inform
   decision-making. Yet, comprehensive guidance on the development of
   bespoke socioeconomic monitoring and evaluation plans for fisheries is
   lacking. This paper fills this gap through outlining the steps in the
   process of designing a socio-economic assessment plan, providing
   reference materials for various aspects (e.g., indicators, methods,
   analysis) of the process, and discussing how results can be communicated
   and used to better inform fisheries management, programs and
   investments. Our aim is to support the efforts of various organizations
   wishing to improve socio-economic and human well-being outcomes in
   fisheries. This paper will be useful to governments, non-governmental
   organizations, and funders working in fisheries ? as well as applied
   marine social scientists who are working with them to develop
   socio-economic monitoring and evaluation plans.},

Title = {Malthusian overfishing and efforts to overcome it on Kenyan coral reefs},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {18},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1516-1529},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study examined trends along a gradient of fishing intensity in an
   artisanal coral reef fishery over a 10-year period along 75 km of
   Kenya's most populated coastline. As predicted by Malthusian scenarios,
   catch per unit effort (CPUE), mean trophic level, the functional
   diversity of fished taxa, and the diversity of gear declined, while
   total annual catch and catch variability increased along the fishing
   pressure gradient. The fishery was able to sustain high (similar to 16
   Mg.km(-2).yr(-1)) but variable yields at high fishing pressure due to
   the dominance of a few productive herbivorous fish species in the catch.
   The effect of two separate management strategies to overcome this
   Malthusian pattern was investigated: fisheries area closure and
   elimination of the dominant and most ``competitive'' gear. We found that
   sites within 5 km of the enforced closure showed significantly lower
   total catch and CPUE, but increased yield stability and trophic level of
   catch than predicted by regression models normalized for fishing effort.
   Sites that had excluded illegal beach seine use through active gear
   management exhibited increased total catch and CPUE. There was a strong
   interaction between closure and gear management, which indicates that,
   for closures to be effective at increasing catch, there must be
   simultaneous efforts at gear management around the periphery of the
   closures. We propose that Malthusian effects are responsible for the
   variation in gear and catch and that active management through reduced
   effort and reductions in the most competitive gear have the greatest
   potential to increase the functional and trophic diversity and
   per-person productivity.},

Title = {Pacific Canada's Rockfish Conservation Areas: using Ostrom's design
   principles to assess management effectiveness},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {International declines in marine biodiversity have lead to the creation
   of marine protected areas and fishery reserve systems. In Canada, 164
   Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs) were implemented between 2003 and
   2007 and now cover 4847.2 km(2) of ocean. These reserves were created in
   response to widespread concern from fishers and nongovernmental
   organizations about inshore rockfish (genus Sebastes) population
   declines. We used the design principles for effective common-pool
   resource management systems, originally developed by Elinor Ostrom, to
   assess the social and ecological effectiveness of these conservation
   areas more than 10 years after their initial implementation. We assessed
   the relative presence or absence of each design principle within current
   RCA management. We found that 2 of the 11 design principles were
   moderately present in the recreational fishery. All other design
   principles were lacking for the recreational sector. We found that 2
   design principles were fully present and 5 were moderately present in
   the commercial sector. Four design principles were lacking in the
   commercial sector. Based on this analysis, we highlight 4 main areas for
   management improvement: (1) create an education and outreach campaign to
   explain RCA rules, regulations, boundaries, and the need for marine
   conservation; (2) increase monitoring of users and resources to
   discourage noncompliance and gather the necessary data to create social
   buy-in for marine conservation; (3) encourage informal nested governance
   through stakeholder organizations for education and self-regulation
   (e.g. fisher to fisher); and (4) most importantly, create a formal,
   decadal RCA review process to gather stakeholder input and make
   amendments to regulations and RCA boundaries. This information can be
   used to inform spatial management systems both in Canada and
   internationally. This analysis also contributes to a growing literature
   on effectively scaling up small-scale management techniques for
   large-scale, often federally run, common-pool resource systems.},

Title = {Higher Abundance of Marine Predators and Changes in Fishers' Behavior
   Following Spatial Protection within the World's Biggest Shark Fishery},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Abstract = {Fisheries are complex social-ecological systems, where managers struggle
   to balance the socio-economic interests of fishing communities with the
   biology and ecology of fisheries species. Spatial closures are a popular
   measure to address conservation and fisheries management goals,
   including the protection of shark populations. However, very little
   research has been published on the effectiveness of shark-specific
   closures to protect sharks, or their impacts on fisher behavior.
   Situated within the global center of tropical marine biodiversity,
   Indonesia's shark fishery contributes more to the international shark
   fin trade than any other nation. Here we evaluate the effect of
   shark-specific closures on sharks and other species of interest, as well
   as shark fishers' responses to losing access to their former fishing
   grounds. We assessed shark diversity and abundance in an open access
   zone (OAZ) and two No-Take Zones (NTZs) of a Marine Protected Area
   within the recently established shark sanctuary in Raja Ampat,
   Indonesia, where sharks have high monetary value as a tourism
   attraction. Shark abundance was significantly higher in the privately
   managed NTZs than in the OAZ. Across all management zones, neither zone
   size, depth nor reef complexity explained variations in shark abundance,
   suggesting that governance is the main driver of successful shark
   conservation areas. These trends were also reflected in species targeted
   by small-scale reef fisheries, including snappers, emperor, groupers,
   tunas, mackerels, and large-bodied wrasse and parrotfish. Interviews
   with shark fishers who lost access to their primary fishing grounds when
   the shark sanctuary was established showed that while most fishers
   (88\%) knew that sharks were protected in Raja Ampat, many were unsure
   about the purpose of the sanctuary. Few fishers felt that the agencies
   implementing fishing bans understood their livelihood needs. We found
   that shark fishers adapted to the loss of former fishing grounds by
   shifting fishing effort to other locations or diversifying their
   livelihoods, including illegal petrol transport. While conserving sharks
   for tourism can be effective, it may inadvertently result in displacing
   fishing effort to unprotected regions. We propose that effective shark
   conservation in Indonesia will need to combine strategic spatial
   protection with efforts to support livelihood security and
   diversification.},

Abstract = {Governance of marine resources underscores the role of social, economic,
   and political objectives in achieving conservation outcomes. Marine
   protected areas, specifically no-take areas (NTAs) where all extractive
   uses are prohibited, are now widely-used to promote sustainable
   fisheries and protect marine biodiversity. However, no take areas have
   had mixed success, and the governance structures that determine success
   are not well understood. The institutional, social, economic, and
   political context of the no-take areas and the response of resource
   users to their establishment are rarely considered in establishing
   marine reserves. In developing countries with high levels of poverty and
   low enforcement capacity, harvest practices rarely adhere to formal laws
   and regulations. As a consequence, many no-take areas have become
   ``paper parks{''} that fail to provide ecological and social benefits.
   In this paper, we use the Coupled-Infrastructure System (CIS) framework
   to explore the problem of ``paper parks{''} by assessing stakeholder
   perceptions, preferences, and levels of knowledge on NTAs within a
   regional system of three no-take areas in the Gulf of California,
   Mexico. Using structured interviews, we found differences in perceptions
   about the use of NTAs for conservation of biodiversity and management of
   fisheries, misconceptions about the location of current NTAs, and
   problems of non-compliance behavior. We identify a weak relationship
   between the perception of NTAs by the resource users and the way in
   which current NTA tools operate in Mexico. Consequently, anticipated
   success based on the mere presence of the NTA and its regulations is
   hindered by how the resource users interact with the resource itself,
   but more importantly by what leads up to this hindrance. A focus on this
   weakness in the CIS system is critical to achieving NTA objectives.},

Title = {Sea cucumber fisheries: global analysis of stocks, management measures
   and drivers of overfishing},
Journal = {FISH AND FISHERIES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {34-59},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Worldwide, most sea cucumber fisheries are ineffectively managed,
   leading to declining stocks and potentially eroding the resilience of
   fisheries. We analyse trends in catches, fishery status, fishing
   participation and regulatory measures among 77 sea cucumber fisheries
   through data from recent fishery reports and fishery managers. Critical
   gaps in fisheries biology knowledge of even commonly targeted species
   undermine the expected success of management strategies. Most tropical
   fisheries are small-scale, older and typified by numerous (>8) species,
   whereas temperate fisheries are often emerging, mono-specific and
   industrialized. Fisher participation data indicated about 3million sea
   cucumber fishers worldwide. Fisher participation rates were
   significantly related to the average annual yield. permanova analysis
   showed that over-exploited and depleted fisheries employed different
   sets of measures than fisheries with healthier stocks, and a non-metric
   multidimensional scaling ordination illustrated that a broad set of
   regulatory measures typified sustainable fisheries. SIMPER and
   regression tree analyses identified that the dissimilarity was most
   related to enforcement capacity, number of species harvested, fleet
   (vessel) controls, limited entry controls and rotational closures. The
   national Human Development Index was significantly lower in countries
   with over-exploited and depleted fisheries. Where possible, managers
   should limit the number of fishers and vessel size and establish short
   lists of permissible commercial species in multispecies fisheries. Our
   findings emphasize an imperative to support the enforcement capacity in
   low-income countries, in which risk of biodiversity loss is
   exceptionally high. Solutions for greater resilience of sea cucumber
   stocks must be embedded within those for poverty reduction and
   alternative livelihood options.},

Title = {Managing Marine Protected Areas in Remote Areas: The Case of the
   Subantarctic Heard and McDonald Islands},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Month = {OCT 11},
Abstract = {Large marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly being established
   to contribute to global conservation targets but present an immense
   challenge for managers as they seek to govern human interactions with
   the environment over a vast geographical expanse. These challenges are
   further compounded by the remote location of some MPAs, which magnify
   the costs of management activities. However, large size and remoteness
   alone may be insufficient to achieve conservation outcomes in the
   absence of critical management functions such as environmental
   monitoring and enforcement. The Australian subantarctic Heard Island and
   McDonald Islands (HIMI) Marine Reserve is among the world's most remote
   MPAs with notoriously harsh oceanographic conditions, and yet the
   region's rich mammal and fish resources have been exploited
   intermittently since the mid-1800s. More recently, the development of
   lucrative international markets for Patagonian toothfish, sold as
   Chilean seabass, led to the growth in both legal and illegal fishing. In
   2002, to conserve the unique ecology and biodiversity in the area,
   Australia declared a 65,000 km2 MPA around HIMI. Worldwide, government
   agencies have, however, struggled to develop cost-effective
   institutional arrangements for conservation. This paper therefore draws
   upon the social-ecological systems meta-analysis database (SESMAD) to
   characterize the structure of conservation governance and outcomes in
   the HIMI Marine Reserve. The Marine Reserve has generally been
   successful in supporting a sustainable fishery while addressing threats
   to biodiversity. The remote and isolated nature of the Marine Reserve
   was critical to its success, but also benefited greatly from
   collaborations between managers and the fishing industry. Commercial
   fishers keep watch over the Reserve while fishing, report any
   observations of illegal fishing (none since 2006/07), and have at times
   been asked to verify remote observation of potential illegal fishing
   vessels. The industry also undertakes annual ecological surveys in the
   MPA, allowing managers to track environmental trends. The fishing
   industry itself highlights the importance of industry participation in
   conservation planning, strengthened by secure access to resources via
   statutory fishing rights, which provide critical incentives to invest in
   conservation. We therefore reflect on the potential application of this
   case to other remote large MPAs, highlighting potential directions for
   future research.},

Title = {Social-ecological traps link food systems to nutritional outcomes},
Journal = {GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {30},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Recognized as an emerging global crisis in the mid-1990s, the
   ``nutrition transition{''} is marked by a shift to Western diets,
   dominated by highly processed, sugar-sweetened, and high caloric foods.
   Occurring in parallel to these health transitions are dramatic shifts in
   the natural systems that underlie food availability and access.
   Traditionally, environmental degradation and ecosystem change, and
   processes of nutritional transition, though often collinear and
   potentially causally linked, have been addressed in isolation. Food
   systems represent an emblematic social-ecological system, as both
   cultivated and wild foods are directly reliant on natural ecosystems and
   their processes. While healthy ecosystems are a necessary precondition
   of food production, they are not themselves sufficient to ensure
   continued benefits from local food systems. Mediating between food
   production and nutritional security are myriad governance and market
   institutions that shape differential access to food resources. Moreover,
   globalization and urbanization may shift communities from non-market to
   market-based economies, with profound implications for local
   environments and food systems. Specifically, we argue that it is this
   feedback between coupled socioeconomic and natural dynamics within food
   systems that reinforces specific nutritional outcomes, and may result in
   a social-ecological trap. Here, we use the case of reef-based food
   systems globally, paying particular attention to the Pacific to showcase
   social-ecological traps present in global food systems, and to
   illustrate how such traps lead to the acceleration of the nutrition
   transition. Improving both nutritional and environmental outcomes of
   food systems requires understanding the underlying drivers of each, and
   how they interact and reinforce each other. Only in recognizing these
   interactions and coupled dynamics will economic, governance, and
   environmental policies be positioned to address these food system
   challenges in an integrated fashion.},

Abstract = {Marine wild-capture fisheries depend on the capacity of the ocean to
   provide a flow of harvestable resources to sustain the industry.
   Paradoxically, conventional fishing often undermines these resources by
   degrading the environment and overexploiting fish stocks. Many UK
   fisheries have declined for over a century due to a biased focus on
   their social-economic value and lack of recognition that they are
   social-ecological systems and need to be managed as such. With the UK's
   recent transition to an independent coastal state, the Fisheries Act
   (2020) and associated Joint Fisheries Statement provide an opportunity
   to correct this. Focusing on the ecological foun-dations, a more
   sustainable future for UK fisheries may be achieved by: (1) implementing
   a conservative quota setting system based on Maximum Sustainable Yield
   (MSY), defined as that which would occur when the biomass of a
   population of the target species is at 50\% of that estimated at
   carrying capacity, to set catch limits rather than targets. The biomass
   of fish stocks should be allowed to regenerate to a minimum of 120\% of
   that which will achieve MSY to provide a buffer against the uncertainty
   in ecological response to climate change. (2) Fishing capacity should be
   reduced while redistributing a greater share of the quota to sectors of
   the fleet that are demonstrably more sustainable; recognising that short
   term compensation may be required by some to mitigate the impacts of
   displaced activity until the benefits of stock recovery are realised.
   (3) Greater restrictions should be applied to ensure the most damaging
   fishing techniques (e.g. bottom trawling and dredging) are prohibited as
   appropriate in the network of marine protected areas. Protection should
   be enforced to promote the regeneration of degraded habitats and
   restoration of fish populations to help achieve the objectives as set
   out in the Act.},

Title = {``Like the plains people losing the buffalo{''}: perceptions of climate
   change impacts, fisheries management, and adaptation actions by
   Indigenous peoples in coastal British Columbia, Canada},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Rapidly developing and complex climate change impacts have profound
   implications for coastal communities, demanding adaptation actions for
   both social and ecological systems. Along the coast of British Columbia,
   Canada, Indigenous peoples developed a tightly coupled social-ecological
   system that was interrupted by the arrival of settler colonialism in the
   1800s. Although both climate change adaptation and the impacts of
   colonization have been well studied, little research has examined how
   these themes interact, and the conditions that may support or prevent
   people's ability to adapt to the social-ecological changes that emerge.
   Through a collaborative partnership with four First Nations and their
   umbrella organization for technical support, we examined people's
   perceptions of social and ecological aspects of adaptation to climate
   change. Using semistructured interviews (n = 50), four key strategies
   emerged as critical for climate change adaptation: (1) strengthening
   Indigenous governance autonomy and authority, (2) promoting knowledge
   sharing for adaptation practices within and among communities, (3)
   promoting adaptive comanagement among governance scales, and (4)
   developing learning platforms for climate impacts and adaptive
   strategies. Actions typically proposed by non-Indigenous government,
   including marine protected areas and ecosystem-based management were not
   prioritized. We found diverse attitudes toward climate change impacts,
   indicating that people's perceptions of adaptation strategies are
   strongly influenced by exposure to observable impacts, the
   social-ecological context in which they live, and perceptions of
   governance and self-determination. Our study suggests that supporting
   Indigenous peoples' ability to adapt to climate change will require
   transforming the current governance model into one that acknowledges
   Indigenous social, cultural, and food needs and how these relate to
   marine resources and territorial management rights.},

Title = {Real-world progress in overcoming the challenges of adaptive spatial
   planning in marine protected areas},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {181},
Pages = {54-63},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Guidelines for spatial planning, including those from integrated coastal
   management, systematic conservation planning, and marine spatial
   planning, have conceived planning processes as iterative and adaptive.
   Adaptive spatial planning is advocated because it allows decisions to be
   improved with new data, as knowledge accumulates on management within
   particular contexts, and to fine-tune spatial management arrangements to
   fit constantly changing social-ecological systems. Yet, to date there
   have been very few reviews of the process and practice of adaptive
   spatial planning in real-world contexts. Here we review the theoretical
   challenges presented in the literature on adaptive spatial planning
   against 5 case studies of adaptive planning in the marine realm: Kubulau
   District, Fiji; Southeast Cebu, Philippines; the Great Barrier Reef,
   Australia; central California, USA; and KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Our
   aim is to assess the extent to which the theoretical challenges have
   been addressed in practice. We find that none of the case studies
   analyzed effectively addressed all the challenges of adaptive spatial
   planning. Differences in legislation, resources, and capacity to
   undertake adaptive spatial planning mean that each planning process is
   operated differently in each case study. For example, adaptive spatial
   planning can occur through a structured and institutionalized approach
   when resources and government support are available, but it can also
   operate in a relatively more opportunistic and flexible way if
   governments are weaker but civil society has strong champions. Although
   the case studies addressed aspects of adaptive planning, some persistent
   challenges remain, including scientific gaps regarding triggers for
   adaptation and unsympathetic institutional and policy contexts and
   planning cultures. These challenges must be addressed before all the
   benefits of adaptive spatial planning can be realized. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {Implementing the Western Gulf of Maine Area Closure: The Role and
   Perception of Fishers' Ecological Knowledge},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The debate about the quality of fishers' ecological knowledge (FEK) and
   its value to fisheries management has long been present in the
   literature. This study sought to understand the role of FEK in a
   particular fisheries management decision in the U. S. and to evaluate
   the extent that different stakeholder groups recognized and used FEK in
   fisheries policy creation. The 1998 implementation of the Western Gulf
   of Maine Area Closure (WGoMAC) was a management response to the rapid
   decline in the Gulf of Maine cod (Gadus morhua) stock. Using structured
   surveys and semistructured interviews, we collected information from
   major stakeholder groups that were active during the creation of the
   area closure: New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) members,
   Groundfish Advisory Panel members, Groundfish Plan Development Team
   members, and Maine groundfishers. Results indicated that 95\% of
   respondents believed that fishers possess ecological knowledge that
   could be useful in the fishery management process. In the case of the
   WGoMAC creation, 62\% of respondents indicated that FEK played a role in
   the decision, even though 85\% recognized obstacles to the use of FEK in
   the management process. Interviews demonstrated that FEK was able to
   improve upon the spatial resolution of scientific data by identifying
   seasonal migration patterns of prespawning cod and behavioral
   differences between juvenile and adult cod. This information was a
   product of a peer-reviewed process among groundfishers and it was used
   to fine-tune the exact location of the closure. These findings suggest
   that there are ways to incorporate FEK into fishery management for the
   purposes of stock and habitat conservation. Additionally, the benefit of
   having ecological information that spans different spatial scales for
   fishery management was observed in this study. By combining the
   knowledge systems of fishers and fisheries scientists, managers were
   able to capture ecological information at a finer scale than the scale
   at which landings data are reported and fish stocks analyzed.},

Title = {Social-ecological trends: managing the vulnerability of coastal fishing
   communities},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The loss of biodiversity, including the collapse of fish stocks, affects
   the vulnerability of social-ecological systems (SESs) and threatens
   local livelihoods. Incorporating community-centered indicators and SES
   drivers and exposures of change into coastal management can help
   anticipate and mitigate human and/or coastal vulnerability. We have
   proposed a new index to measure the social-ecological vulnerability of
   coastal fishing communities (Index of Coastal Vulnerability {[}ICY])
   based on species, ecosystem, and social indicators. The ICV varies from
   0 (no vulnerability) to 1 (very high vulnerability) and is composed of 3
   components: species vulnerability, i.e., fish biological traits;
   ecosystem vulnerability, i.e., environmental indicators of ecosystem
   health; and adaptive capacity, i.e., human ability to cope with changes.
   We tested the ICV of Brazil's 17 coastal states. The average ICV for the
   Brazilian coast was 0.77, and variation was low among states. More than
   half of the coastal states revealed very high vulnerability (> 0.8). The
   ecosystem vulnerability values were worse than the adaptive capacity and
   species vulnerability values, and the North and Northeast regions were
   revealed to be vulnerable hot spots. Additionally, we investigated how
   the ICV related to specific anthropogenic risks, i.e., fish landing
   richness, fishery instability, market, coastal extension, and coastal
   population, and found that states with fewer species landings and higher
   coastal populations presented higher ICVs. At a time when human impacts
   are overtaking natural processes, understanding how these impacts lead
   to coastal vulnerability can help improve conservation policies. For
   this case study, we suggest both fisheries management measures and
   restoration of sensitive habitats to protect species and decrease
   vulnerability. The integrated evaluation developed here could be used as
   a baseline for coastal monitoring and conservation planning and be
   applied to coastal regions in which governments evaluate both social and
   biological aspects.},

Title = {Expanding narratives of governance constraints to improve coral reef
   conservation},
Journal = {CONSERVATION BIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {36},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {To understand and address the failures of reef governance, it is
   critical to understand the perceptions of diverse policy makers and
   practitioners about the challenges they face in achieving their goals.
   Examining the discourse of policy makers and practitioners can reveal
   the extent to which these perceptions capture the full spectrum of
   potential governance challenges, including those related to management,
   institutional structures and processes, the values and principles
   underpinning governance, and the social and environmental context. We
   conducted semistructured interviews with 110 policy makers and
   practitioners across multiple sectors, scales, and contexts in Barbados,
   St Kitts and Nevis, Belize, and Honduras. We used thematic qualitative
   analysis informed by theories of interactive governance and
   governability to examine the challenges perceived by governance actors.
   Perceived governance challenges were broadly consistent across
   countries, but differed by sector (V = 0.819, F-6,F-60 = 1.502, p =
   0.01) and by level (community compared with national) (V = 0.194,
   F-1,F-10 = 2.178, = 0.026). Management inputs and outputs, challenges
   relating to the socioeconomic context, issues of leadership and power,
   and stakeholder engagement were commonly cited challenges (>75\%). Few
   respondents discussed challenges relating to the ecological context,
   governance processes, or the values and principles underpinning
   governance. We argue that examining perceptions can inform efforts to
   improve governance and assess the appropriateness of particular
   management tools under context-specific governance constraints.
   Furthermore, expanding the narratives of governance challenges to
   encompass the subtle values and images underpinning governance, and the
   scale of the challenges faced, can help identify a wider set of
   opportunities for change.},

Title = {Integrating societal perspectives and values for improved stewardship of
   a coastal ecosystem engineer},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Oyster reefs provide coastal societies with a vast array of ecosystem
   services, but are also destructively harvested as an economically and
   culturally important fishery resource, exemplifying a complex
   social-ecological system (SES). Historically, societal demand for
   oysters has led to destructive and unsustainable levels of harvest,
   which coupled with multiple other stressors has placed oyster reefs
   among the most globally imperiled coastal habitats. However, more recent
   studies have demonstrated that large-scale restoration is possible and
   that healthy oyster populations can be sustained with effective
   governance and stewardship. However, both of these require significant
   societal support or financial investment. In our study, we explored
   relationships among how coastal societies (1) perceive and value oyster
   ecosystem services, (2) recognize and define problems associated with
   oyster decline, and (3) perceive or support stewardship initiatives. We
   specifically focused on the SES of eastern oysters (Crassostrea
   virginica) and coastal societies in the northern Gulf of Mexico, a
   region identified as offering among the last and best opportunities to
   sustainably balance conservation objectives with a wild fishery. We
   found that, in addition to harvest-related benefits, oysters were highly
   valued for providing habitat, mitigating shoreline erosion, and
   improving water quality or clarity. Our results also showed that
   although most respondents recognized that oyster populations have
   declined, many respondents characterized the problem differently than
   most scientific literature does. Among a variety of initiatives for
   enhancing sustainability, spawning sanctuaries and reef restoration were
   well supported in all states, but support for harvest reductions was
   less consistent. Our study suggests that public support for maintaining
   both harvest and ecosystem services exists at societal levels and that
   enhancing public awareness regarding the extent and causes of oyster
   decline could garner additional support for stewardship initiatives.
   Collectively, the societal, economic, and biophysical complexities of
   the northern Gulf of Mexico oyster SES illustrate the need and public
   support for developing more comprehensive management schemes for
   exploited ecosystem engineers.},

Title = {Sport fisheries: Opportunities and challenges for diversifying coastal
   livelihoods in the Pacific},
Journal = {MARINE POLICY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {42},
Pages = {305-314},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {High population growth rates and poverty are likely to elevate the
   vulnerability of many coastal communities in the Pacific region to
   climate change. Alternative livelihood strategies which can generate
   income and simultaneously conserve fish stocks and their habitats are a
   priority. This paper investigates the feasibility of `sport fishing'
   (recreational catch and release angling for particular species of
   predatory game fish) as such a strategy. The limited research of sport
   fisheries in developing countries is augmented with a review of
   community-based ecotourism, integrated conservation and development
   projects (ICDPs) and common property management literature to propose
   design principles. Five prerequisite principles for the success of sport
   fishery enterprises are suggested. First, adequate local capacity must
   be available to manage a tourism business and facilities, supported by
   cross-scale co-management amongst stakeholders. Second, appropriate
   governance arrangements must be in place to ensure the equitable
   dispersal of benefits to all members of the local community, and
   conflict resolution. Third, resource-ownership boundaries and rights
   must be clearly delineated before the enterprise begins in order to
   minimise the potential for future conflict. Fourth, social, biodiversity
   and ecosystem service co-benefits should result from the enterprise.
   These should include improvements in income, health, education, food
   security, the status of the target and non-target species and their
   habitat and non-fishery ecosystem services. Fifth, monitoring and
   evaluation of these principles is required within an adaptive
   co-management framework which takes a social-ecological systems approach
   and includes all stakeholders in social learning and power-sharing.
   Through this, broader impacts of the enterprise may emerge which go
   beyond the standard assessment of ecotourism and ICDP success in
   financial or biodiversity terms. These principles now need to be tested
   by researching the experiences of case studies of sport fishing
   enterprises in the Pacific. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Baltic Health Index (BHI): Assessing the social-ecological status of
   the Baltic Sea},
Journal = {PEOPLE AND NATURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Improving the health of coastal and open sea marine ecosystems
   represents a substantial challenge for sustainable marine resource
   management, since it requires balancing human benefits and impacts on
   the ocean. This challenge is often exacerbated by incomplete knowledge
   and lack of tools that measure ocean and coastal ecosystem health in a
   way that allows consistent monitoring of progress towards predefined
   management targets. The lack of such tools often limits capabilities to
   enact and enforce effective governance. We introduce the Baltic Health
   Index (BHI) as a transparent, collaborative and repeatable assessment
   tool. The Index complements existing, more ecological-oriented,
   approaches by including a human dimension on the status of the Baltic
   Sea, an ecosystem impacted by multiple anthropogenic pressures and
   governed by a multitude of comprehensive national and international
   policies. Using a large amount of social-ecological data available, we
   assessed the health of the Baltic Sea for nine goals that represent the
   status towards set targets, for example, clean waters, biodiversity,
   food provision, natural products extraction and tourism. Our results
   indicate that the overall health of the Baltic Sea is suboptimal (a
   score of 76 out of 100), and a substantial effort is required to reach
   the management objectives and associated targets. Subregionally, the
   lowest BHI scores were measured for carbon storage, contaminants and
   lasting special places (i.e. marine protected areas), albeit with large
   spatial variation. Overall, the likely future status of all goals in the
   BHI averaged for the entire Baltic Sea is better than the present
   status, indicating a positive trend towards a healthier Baltic Sea.
   However, in some Baltic Sea basins, the trend for specific goals was
   decreasing, highlighting locations and issues that should be the focus
   of management priorities. The BHI outcomes can be used to identify both
   pan-Baltic and subregional scale management priorities and to illustrate
   the interconnectedness between goals linked by cumulative pressures.
   Hence, the information provided by the BHI tool and its further
   development will contribute towards the fulfilment of the UN Agenda 2030
   and its Sustainability Development Goals.

   invertebrate harvesting affecting species composition and local

Abstract = {Seagrass meadows support high biodiversity and are important for
   invertebrate harvesting activities in developing countries. The aim of
   this study was to estimate the social and ecological effects of
   invertebrate harvesting, i.e. how this exploitation may affect/has
   affected seagrass variables (biomass, shoot density and canopy height),
   macrofaunal community structure, the use and importance of these
   resources for the livelihood of local people over time. A
   multi-disciplinary approach was used, including interviews with
   harvesters, observations of the number/activities of invertebrate
   harvesters, and a biological field study in Zanzibar, Tanzania. The
   study showed that women/children collect invertebrates, and they prefer
   large seagrass patches, high to medium shoot density, and high seagrass
   cover. All interviewees said they had noticed a decline in seagrass
   distribution over the last decade, >20\% considered it a large decline.
   Interviewees also reported decreased numbers of animals, but no change
   in the number of animal species over the last decade. The main reasons
   for the decline of seagrass and animals according to interviewees, are
   an increase in the number of harvesters, and a change in attitude, i.e.
   people being less careful about the intertidal zone and seagrasses.
   Invertebrate harvesting was found important for food security and
   provision of cash income. The current average catch weight was ca. 2
   kg/collection day/person, and 3 kg and 5 kg, 5-10 and 30 years ago
   respectively according to interviewees. At present, the harvesting women
   earn ca 60-70\% and ca 40\% of what they would have if catches were the
   same sizes as they were 5-10 and 30 years ago respectively, according to
   our calculations. The field sampling within seagrass beds showed that an
   inaccessible/remote site had significantly higher invertebrate abundance
   and species richness/diversity than an exploited site (ANOVA).
   Multivariate statistics further revealed weak but significant
   differences for animal abundance and biomass between these sites. By
   combining findings from both interviews and field sampling this study
   shows that invertebrate harvesters can influence macrofaunal community
   structure in seagrass meadows, which in turn results in negative impacts
   on local harvesters' economy and livelihood.},

Abstract = {This paper seeks to address the missing dimension of the place of
   Maritime communities in Canadian Integrated Coastal Management (ICM).
   This work is part of a larger network of projects on ICM through the
   participatory Coastal Community University Research Alliance. The
   implementation of ICM with full community involvement is a challenge,
   for example: communities are not unified or homogenous units, power
   varies among stakeholders, and silo constructs and turf wars discourage
   involvement of the wider public. In 2007, a survey of nine
   community-based organizations and associations and a First Nation
   community, located within the Annapolis Basin and surrounding areas of
   the Nova Scotia side of the Bay of Fundy was conducted. The purpose of
   the survey was to better understand how the concept of ICM is
   conceptualized and acted upon by local communities and to draw upon this
   to enrich ICM theory.
   Approximately 30 projects representing community-based ICM initiatives
   over the last 10 years were identified, including: capacity building,
   habitat and stock enhancement/management programs and responses to new
   policies or legislative interventions. Several enabling and constraining
   factors for community involvement in ICM were identified. One key
   finding is a major difference between community and government
   approaches. Government ICM initiatives have captured some aspects of the
   environmental and economic management issues, but have generally failed
   to consider cultural and social components. They have also failed to
   take into account the interconnections within and between human and
   ecological systems. Community members report that government is more
   interested in forming partnerships with the corporate sector than with
   the people who rely on local resources. From the community perspective,
   dealing with the resulting power imbalances must involve revisiting the
   core values{''} that underpin regulation and resource exploitation.
   This study demonstrates that communities are usually the ``first
   responders for many ecological problems, and there is a willingness to
   take responsibility for the management of resources. ICM is already
   embedded in on-going community projects, networks and forums. These
   initiatives promote the principles identified in Canada's Oceans Act and
   Oceans Strategy, but the relevant government agencies have provided
   little support to them. ICM has the potential to bring together many
   issues that can be addressed by the multi-stakeholder process, but this
   needs to be facilitated by on-going government collaborations,
   contributions and recognition. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
