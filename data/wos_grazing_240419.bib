Abstract = {The independent and synergic impacts of climatic change and capitalist
   expansion may render pastoral socialecological systems extinct. Climatic
   change compromises rangelands, while economic development fosters
   conversion of pastoral land into territories for capitalist expansion.
   Pastoral ists' institutions regulate decisionmaking to
   socio-environmental change and shape adaptive responses, enabling mobile
   livestock rearing for using multiple grazing areas, and households'
   diverse income sources. These institutions are characterized by
   flexibility, such as mixed individual-collective water and land tenure
   regimes. However, capitalist-led reduction of land-based resources, the
   push for privatization and commodification of land and livestock hinder
   flexibility, and undermine pastoralists' institutions for decision-mak
   ing; ultimately creating challenges for pastoralists' adaptive capacity.
   Research on the compound effects of the expanding global economy and
   climate change on pastoral social-ecological systems is needed to inform
   efforts constraining unregulated capitalist expansion, and policies for
   water and land security. Research, practice, and policies will improve
   pastoral social-ecological systems adaptability and resilience.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an historical analysis (1974-97) of associations
   between land-cover change and socio-economic factors for three villages
   in a former bantustan region of South Africa. The notion of
   social-ecological systems is used as the conceptual framework for this
   analysis, in which the former bantustan region of Bushbuckridge is
   posited as a cultural landscape. The local landscape showed distinctive
   modifications over the study period, broad trends including the growth
   of human settlements and the decrease in woodland cover. However,
   changes were not uniform across sites, and the direction and magnitude
   of changes in land cover were often nonlinear and site-specific.
   Analysis of associations between biophysical and socio-economic changes
   at different scales revealed a range of important interacting forces
   such as population growth, drought, shortages of land, grazing and wood
   resources, weakening institutional governance of natural resources, and
   the diversification of livelihood strategies, including the sale of
   fuelwood, concurrent with declining employment security and cattle
   ownership. Evidence suggests a possible erosion of resilience in these
   social-ecological systems at various scales, with important implications
   for socio-economic development and sustainable resource management.},

Abstract = {To effectively control desertification and reduce the disaster risk of
   grassland social-ecological systems (SESs), in 2002, China launched a
   grazing-prohibiting policy in severely desertified areas. At present, a
   new grazing-prohibiting policy is about to start. Whether the policy
   needs to be adjusted and how to adjust have become issues that need to
   be considered. Based on this, Yanchi County, a typical desertification
   reversal area, was taken as an example to build the grassland SES
   dynamic model. By adjusting the prohibited grazing time and area, this
   study assessed the risk of grassland SES. According to the dynamic
   results: 1) under the current policy, SES resilience will remain stable,
   and the disaster risk of SES will be gradually reduced; 2) when the
   prohibited grazing time was 273 days and the grazing time was from June
   to August, the resilience was the strongest and the disaster risk was
   the lowest; and 3) by adjusting the prohibited grazing area, when the
   proportion of grazing prohibition was 100\%, the disaster risk was the
   lowest.},

Title = {Assessment of the Coordination Ability of Sustainable Social-Ecological

Abstract = {Sandy desertification is one of the most severe ecological problems in
   the world. Essentially, it is land degradation caused by discordance in
   the Social-Ecological Systems (SES). The ability to coordinate SES is a
   principal characteristic of regional sustainable development and a key
   factor in desertification control. This paper directly and
   comprehensively evaluates the ability to coordinate SES in the
   desertification reversal process. Assessment indicators and standards
   for SES have been established using statistical data and materials from
   government agencies. We applied a coordinated development model based on
   Identical-Discrepancy-Contrary (IDC) situational ranking of a Set Pair
   Analysis (SPA) to analyze the change in Yanchi County's coordination
   ability since it implemented the grazing prohibition policy. The results
   indicated that Yanchi County was basically in the secondary grade of the
   national sustainable development level, and the subsystems' development
   trend was relatively stable. Coordinate ability increased from 0.686 in
   2003 to 0.957 in 2014 and experienced ``weak coordination to basic
   coordination to high coordination{''} development processes. We
   concluded that drought, the grazing prohibition dilemma and the
   ecological footprint were key factors impeding the coordination of SES
   development in this area. These findings should provide information
   about desertification control and ecological policy implementation to
   guarantee sustainable rehabilitation.},

Title = {Firewood Collection in South Africa: Adaptive Behavior in
   Social-Ecological Models},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Due to the fact that the South Africa's savanna landscapes are under
   changing conditions, the previously sustainable firewood collection
   system in rural areas has become a social-ecological factor in questions
   about landscape management. While the resilience of savannas in national
   parks such as Kruger National Park (KNP) in South Africa has been widely
   acknowledged in ecosystem management, the resilience of woody vegetation
   outside protected areas has been underappreciated. Collecting wood is
   the dominant source of energy for rural households, and there is an
   urgent need for land management to find sustainable solutions for this
   complex social-ecological system. However, the firewood collection
   scenario is only one example, and stands for all human-ecosystem service
   interactions under the topic of over-utilization, e.g., fishery,
   grazing, harvesting. Agent-based modeling combined with goal-oriented
   action planning (GOAP) can provide fresh insights into the relationship
   between individual needs of humans and changes in land use. At the same
   time, this modeling approach includes adaptive behavior under changing
   conditions. A firewood collection scenario was selected for a
   proof-of-concept comprising households, collectors, ecosystem services
   and firewood sites. Our results have shown that, even when it is
   predictable what a single human agent will do, massive up-scaling is
   needed in order to understand the whole complexity of social-ecological
   systems. Under changing conditions, such as climate and an increasing
   population, fair distribution of natural goods become an important
   issue.},

Abstract = {In the western US, grazing management on federal lands containing
   habitat for fish species listed under the US Endangered Species Act
   (ESA) has sparked social conflict and litigation for decades. To date,
   the problem has been addressed through a top-down environmental
   governance system, but rangeland managers and grazing permittees now
   believe there is a need for more innovative management strategies. This
   article explores how social-ecological systems (SES) science can address
   rangeland management challenges associated with the survival and
   recovery of ESA-listed fish species on federal lands where cattle
   grazing is a dominant type of land use. We focus on the Blue Mountains
   of eastern Oregon, where the Mountain Social Ecological Observatory
   Network's Blue Mountains Working Group is collaborating with diverse
   stakeholders to develop and test a novel grazing system designed to
   reduce the impact of cattle on riparian areas using an SES science
   approach. Although not a complete solution, SES science holds promise
   for improving rangeland management.},

Abstract = {Many ecosystems are actually social-ecological systems (SESs) consisting
   of mutually interacting natural and social subsystems. Resilience, the
   capacity to absorb or withstand perturbations while maintaining
   structure and functions, is an important feature of these systems.
   Indigenous or traditional knowledge is considered to be an important
   factor in being able to absorb change and maintain structure in the
   context of ecosystem dynamics. In this article, I use the framework of
   resilience to analyze how the Bedouin communities in Wadi Allaqi, Egypt,
   experienced and responded to the disturbing impact of Lake Nasser's
   formation in the mid-1960s. Prior to that disturbance, the Bedouin
   lifestyle was characterized by traditional pastoral life based on
   rotational grazing by their herds. Afterward, the Bedouins permanently
   settled along the shores to make use of the new abundant water resource.
   This resulted in overgrazing of the rangelands along the lakeside and
   the disappearance of the traditional pastoral lifestyle. However, the
   Bedouins later learned to use the Najas species in the lake, ushering in
   a new SES. This new system is based on tactical grazing along the
   shores, giving the rangelands the opportunity to recover from the
   temporary grazing pressure. I argue that because many degraded
   ecosystems are actually SESs, ecological restoration should also focus
   on societal-level measures.},

   strategy adopted by mountain pastoralists combines 7 different grazing
   mechanisms and stall feeding to use spatially segregated and seasonally
   productive rangeland resources in a sustainable manner. These seasonal
   mechanisms involve different types of livestock mobility, diverse fodder
   consumption, and grazing patterns. In winter, livestock are kept in
   stalls near the village. During spring, sheep and goats are taken to
   nearby low-lying pastures and meadows on a rotation basis. In summer,
   livestock and people move away from the village to settlements along a
   3000 m elevational range to graze on the available pastures. Finally, in
   autumn, as the livestock descend, they browse intensively on stubble
   fields before the winter crops are planted. Furthermore, this strategy
   is based on the coordination of households' available labor force and
   pasture readiness. This study provides nuanced information on mountain
   pastoralists and rangeland management systems. The findings are useful
   for policymakers and practitioners in designing effective programs and
   policies to decrease the vulnerability and enhance the resilience of
   mountain social-ecological systems.},

Journal = {ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This study aims at supporting the maintenance of representative
   functional habitat networks as green infrastructure for biodiversity
   conservation through transdisciplinary macroecological analyses of wet
   grassland landscapes and their stewardship systems. We chose ten north
   European wet grassland case study landscapes from Iceland and the
   Netherlands in the west to Lithuania and Belarus in the east. We combine
   expert experiences for 20-30 years, comparative studies made 2011-2017,
   and longitudinal analyses spanning >70 years. Wader, or shorebird,
   (Charadrii) assemblages were chosen as a focal species group. We used
   evidence-based knowledge and practical experience generated in three
   steps. (1) Experts from 8 wet grassland landscapes in northern Europe's
   west and east mapped factors linked to patterns and processes, and
   management and governance, in social-ecological systems that affect
   states and trends of wet grasslands as green infrastructures for wader
   birds. (2) To understand wader conservation problems and their dynamic
   in wet grassland landscapes, and to identify key issues for successful
   conservation, we applied group modeling using causal loop diagram
   mapping. (3) Validation was made using the historic development in two
   additional wet grassland landscapes. Wader conservation was dependent on
   ten dynamically interacting ecological and social system factors as
   leverage points for management. Re-wetting and grazing were common
   drivers for the ecological and social system, and long-term economic
   support for securing farmers' interest in wader bird conservation.
   Financial public incentives at higher levels of governance of wetland
   management are needed to stimulate private income loops. Systems
   analysis based on contrasting landscape case studies in space and over
   time can support (1) understanding of complex interactions in
   social-ecological systems, (2) collaborative learning in individual wet
   grassland landscapes, and (3) formulation of priorities for
   conservation, management, and restoration.},

Title = {Toward an urgent yet deliberate conservation strategy: sustaining
   social-ecological systems in rangelands of the Northern Great Plains,
   Montana},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Urgency and deliberateness are often at odds when executing conservation
   projects, especially as the scale and complexity of objectives
   increases. The pace of environmental degradation supports immediate and
   measurable action. However, best practices for adaptive governance and
   building resilient social-ecological systems call for more deliberate
   efforts and participatory processes, which can be slow. We explore
   conflicts between urgency and deliberateness and the potential for their
   reconciliation through a case study of the challenges of conserving
   native rangelands in North America's Northern Great Plains, an ecoregion
   targeted for global conservation initiatives. This region is undergoing
   a significant social-ecological transition, which underscores a need to
   rethink conservation strategies in light of the social-ecological system
   dynamics and potential future trajectories. Based on a structured
   narrative literature review process and iterative engagement with key
   regional stakeholders, we identify three interrelated factors critical
   to the system's future outcomes that illustrate system complexity as
   well as trade-offs between urgent and deliberate action and unilateral
   and multilateral approaches to conservation: (1) influences of land
   management on biodiversity, (2) economic restructuring and shifting land
   use priorities, and (3) changing climate and disturbance regimes. We
   identify key gaps in the literature for each factor and across the
   factors-an effort that informs our call for research and practice
   agendas that address uncertainty and complexity at regional scales
   through more inclusive and future-oriented approaches.},

Title = {Rebuilding pastoral social-ecological resilience on the Qinghai-Tibetan
   Plateau in response to changes in policy, economics, and climate},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Economic, policy, and climate changes have profoundly influenced
   pastoral social-ecological systems on the Tibetan Plateau. Climate
   change is believed to be leading to increasing extreme weather
   conditions such as snow disasters and droughts, putting a strain on the
   rangeland resources herders must have to increase income. Market-based
   economic reforms and interrelated development policies such as the
   Rangeland Household Contract Policy, the Ecological Construction
   Project, and herder settlement Initiatives have increased integration of
   pastoral regions into modern markets with promotion of tourism, expanded
   livestock markets, and marketing opportunities for rangeland resources.
   Although allocating common rangelands to households is the foundation of
   current rangeland management strategies to achieve these goals, it
   removes important technologies for coping with high variability in
   rangeland forage production from the traditional rangeland management
   portfolio on the Tibetan Plateau. These include shared risk, shared
   labor, seasonal and yearly herd mobility, and access to diverse areas of
   rangelands and multiple water sources. Field study of two villages in
   Guinan County of Qinghai Province, and Ruoergai County of Sichuan
   Province from 2011 to 2014 found that the villages responded to
   externally driven policy, economic, and climate changes with an
   innovative locally adapted quota-based grazing management system that
   preserves valuable management technologies, conserves rangeland
   resources, and provides individual opportunities for financial gain. In
   this way the village social-ecological system has exhibited considerable
   resiliency, maintaining a form of community governance that functions to
   manage the rangelands, improve well-being as indicated by livestock
   productivity, and, according to local perceptions, maintain rangeland
   condition. The community-based grazing quota system devised by the
   villages occupies a middle ground between common and individual models
   for resource use because it focuses more on how to equitably distribute
   services and utilities from rangelands, instead of how to distribute
   rangelands.},

Title = {The role of social institutions in indigenous Andean Pastoralists'
   adaptation to climate-related water hazards},
Journal = {CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9, SI},
Pages = {780-791},
Month = {OCT 21},
Abstract = {Though Andean indigenous communities have a lengthy history of capable
   responding to water threats, anthropogenic climate change and soaring
   water demand have changed preterit water challenges into serious
   hazards. Using an ethnographic approach, this study examines how a
   Peruvian indigenous pastoralist community perceived and responded to
   climate-change induced water threats with the goal of understanding the
   mechanisms that enable such responses. Pastoralists report that
   alterations in water availability diminish the size and quality of
   wetlands and pastures, thus decreasing fodder for their livestock. Their
   primary adaptive responses are the creation of wetlands and the movement
   of livestock. A set of nested dynamic and flexible institutions enable
   households and supra-household units to carry out adaptive responses by
   facilitating access to alternate grazing areas and the labour force
   necessary to reshape the landscape. Institutions and local knowledge
   supporting the responses are open to exogenous information which
   generates opportunities for collaboration and innovation in the face of
   water hazards which in turn foments the resilience of indigenous
   pastoral social-ecological systems. This study reveals how indigenous
   knowledge and institutions contain strategies for adaptation to water
   stress that may be scaled up and replicated in national and sub-national
   programs.},

Title = {Ecosystem Services Linking Social and Ecological Systems: River
   Brownification and the Response of Downstream Stakeholders},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The theoretical framework of ecosystem services and that of resilience
   thinking are combined in an empirical case study of a social-ecological
   system. In the River Helge a catchment in southern Sweden, a slow
   increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) results in brownification of
   the water with consequences on ecosystem services in the lower part of
   the catchment of concern by local resource managers. An assessment of
   ecosystem service delivery was conducted to (1) identify plausible
   drivers of brownification in the study site and assess future ecosystem
   service delivery for stakeholders in downstream areas. An analysis of
   the perspective of beneficiaries, using qualitative methods, was pursued
   to (2) evaluate the impacts of brownification on downstream
   stakeholders.
   Our analyses of drivers of brownification in combination with climate
   change projections suggests that Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere
   Reserve will experience extreme water flows much more frequently than
   the system is accustomed to today, and that these water flows will be
   highly affected by brownification. The combination of severe summer
   flooding and high water color constituted a new disturbance regime and
   thus requires new adaptive strategies by local stakeholders. A range of
   coping and adaptation strategies were displayed by the farmers but also
   a possible transformation strategy, i.e., abandonment of the seasonally
   flooded meadows. Because hay making and grazing are central components
   in the active management of the Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere
   Reserve, to discontinue this practice would have system-wide
   ramifications for the Biosphere Reserve. The vulnerability of fishing in
   the culturally significant ``Eel Coast,{''} part of the downstream area,
   was also exposed.
   We argue that for environmental monitoring of slow changing variables to
   make sense to local stakeholders, clear links to ecosystem service
   benefits are required. The responsibility for this and thus for matching
   of social and ecological scales falls heavily on regional managers. We
   further argue that resilience of a social-ecological system can be
   estimated by observing and analyzing how local stakeholders respond to
   disturbances, i.e., by analyzing their response strategies.},

Title = {Climate change mitigation as a co-benefit of regenerative ranching:
   insights from Australia and the United States},
Journal = {INTERFACE FOCUS},

Abstract = {`Managed grazing' is gaining attention for its potential to contribute
   to climate change mitigation by reducing bare ground and promoting
   perennialization, thereby enhancing soil carbon sequestration (SCS).
   Understanding why ranchers adopt managed grazing is key to developing
   the right incentives. In this paper, we explore principles and practices
   associated with the larger enterprise of `regenerative ranching' (RR),
   which includes managed grazing but infuses the practice with holistic
   decision-making. We argue that this broader approach is appealing due to
   a suite of ecological, economic and social benefits, making climate
   change mitigation an afterthought, or `co-benefit'. RR is challenging,
   however, because it requires a deep understanding of ecological
   processes along with a set of skills related to monitoring and moving
   livestock and feeding the soil microbiome. We review the literature
   regarding links between RR and SCS, then present results of qualitative
   research focused on motivators, enablers and constraints associated with
   RR, drawing on interviews with 52 practitioners in New South Wales,
   Australia and the western United States. Our analysis is guided by a
   conceptual model of the social-ecological system associated with RR that
   identifies determinants of regenerative potential. We discuss
   implications for rancher engagement and conclude with a consideration of
   leverage points for global scalability.},

Abstract = {Due to recent outbreaks of native bark beetles, forest ecosystems have
   experienced substantial changes in landscape structure and function,
   which also affect nearby human populations. As a result, land managers
   have been tasked with sustaining ecosystem services in impacted areas by
   considering the best available science, public perceptions, and
   monitoring data to develop strategies to suppress bark beetle epidemics,
   and in some cases to restore affected lands and ecosystem services. The
   effects of bark beetle outbreaks are often detrimental to the provision
   of ecosystem services, including degraded landscape aesthetics and
   diminished air and water quality. However, there have been instances
   where bark beetle outbreaks have benefited communities by, for example,
   improving habitat for grazing animals and enhancing real-estate values.
   As a consequence of the interaction of a warming climate and susceptible
   forest stand conditions, the frequency, severity, and extent of bark
   beetle outbreaks are expected to increase and therefore will continue to
   challenge many social-ecological systems. We synthesize experiences from
   recent outbreaks to encourage knowledge transfer from previously
   impacted communities to potentially vulnerable locations that may be at
   risk from future bark beetle epidemics.},

Abstract = {Grazing-based livestock production, named pastoralism, is classified
   into nomadism, transhumance and agro-pastoralism. Transhumance is
   characterised by the seasonal and recurring movement of livestock
   whereby seasonal grazing areas and routes for livestock movement are
   fixed. All grazing based livestock production systems including
   transhumance are constrained globally for a variety of reasons. The
   major threats to the system are globalisation, nationalisation or
   privatisation of rangelands, national parks and community forestry
   policies restricting free grazing and shortage of labour. The collapse
   or decline of such social-ecological systems (SESs), which have existed
   for over 1000s years, often induces adverse impacts on societies and
   ecosystems. Here we review the literature on transhumance, and discuss
   reasons for transhumance, and the associated advantages and
   disadvantages of livestock movement in transhumance. Our review also
   focuses on how the integration of crop and livestock production in
   transhumance derives mutual benefits. The review indicates that the
   seasonal movement of livestock is an ecological necessity in areas with
   harsh climates and low pasture production. Transhumance is also a
   herders' adaptive management to adjust to variable grazing resources and
   environmental conditions. The disadvantages of seasonal movement of
   livestock such as greater herding labour required and expenditure of
   more energy for livestock, are far outweighed by the ecological
   advantages. Some of these are: to minimise grazing competition and to
   protect rangeland pastures from being over-grazed. Our review also
   indicates that the integration of crop and livestock production derives
   mutual benefits and contributes for their enhanced sustainability.},

Volume = {38},

Abstract = {Legislation and policy are key tools used by governments to change the
   socio-economic and political landscape of agrarian systems with
   consequences for mobile pastoralism. This study used the
   social-ecological systems framework to examine how pastoral mobility in
   the semi-arid, montane communal rangeland in South Africa adapted to the
   changing socio-political landscape. It analysed the impact of apartheid
   and democratic era legislation and policies over the past 70 years.
   Apartheid legislation promoted betterment planning and the privatisation
   of communal lands by awarding access to most of the grazing areas to a
   few wealthier pastoralists. This led to increased stocking densities and
   further restriction of herd mobility when the majority of herds were
   restricted to fewer grazing camps. Democratic era land reform policies
   continue to advocate for the modernisation and sedentarisation of
   pastoral practices. The persistence of mobility among livestock keepers
   despite discriminatory policy interventions suggests that this is a
   particularly resilient and necessary element of their practices. We
   argue that agricultural legislation and policies regarding livestock
   farming should promote landscape connectivity to allow mobile
   pastoralists to access variable resources. Connected landscapes should
   be viewed as alternative ways to modernising pastoralism and these
   should prevent elite capture when the land is subdivided.},

   manipulations of Social Ecological Systems (SESs) by commercial stock

   lands into the hinterland thereby accepting or condoning their
   annihilation or demographic reduction. By displaying the different ways
   in which commercial stock farmers have engineered changes in the
   ecological system I will show that traditional definitions of the term
   genocide fall short of applied techniques of decimation which consist of
   a combination of micro-practices and quotidian low-level violence. It is
   doubtful that given the complexity and the resilience of SES, however, a
   group of commercial stock farmers is able to operate the system (of
   which, after all, they are an element) in a controlled way. I argue
   nevertheless that the term ecocide should be applied to the way stock
   farmers changed the habitat of the Indigenous population, because the
   settlers had agency without understanding the totality of their actions.
   SES as coupled complex systems are dependent on the existence of
   bio-diversity, the intensity of grazing,(1) defoliation, habitat
   fragmentation and changes of the soil as a consequence of
   densification.(2)},

Title = {Current agri-environmental policies dismiss varied perceptions and

Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {69},
Pages = {564-576},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Traditional rural biotopes (TRBs) are threatened habitats that host
   significant biodiversity and several ecosystem services, and depend on
   active management such as low-intensity grazing. The current study
   explores private landowners' decision-making on TRB management and
   abandonment within a social-ecological system framework. We provide
   insight into supporting resilience of TRB systems in the face of
   agricultural modernization. Using a mixed methods approach with content
   analysis and Q analysis, we demonstrate that TRB management fosters
   cultural, biological, aesthetic, and utilitarian values. These are
   reflected in different ways through conservationist's, profit-oriented
   farmer's, landscape manager's, and landscape admirer's discourses on TRB
   management. Overall, management reinforces landowners' place attachment,
   and reflects an approach to landscapes as spatial representations of
   cultural heritage and identity over multiple generations. Landowners
   consider TRB pasturage and its social-ecological outcomes motivating and
   rewarding. Giving up grazing cattle and perceived bureaucracy of
   national agri-environment scheme contribute to TRB abandonment.
   Landowners point out that current policies detach TRB management from
   what is seen as ``regular agriculture{''}, and the focus on monetary
   compensation bypasses the multiple values tied to TRB management. Based
   on our results, we suggest that promoting TRBs requires reconfiguring
   the current arrangement of remedial management payments and adopting a
   more participatory governance approach. Locally, resilience of TRB
   systems relies on the connections between landowners and landscapes that
   foster sense of place and landscape identity, which can be supported by
   knowledge sharing and collaborative grazing efforts among landowners.},

Abstract = {Across the world, social-ecological rangeland systems have been
   transformed from a preindustrial extensive status to intensive
   exploitation, often leading to long-term livestock population booms,
   overgrazing, and rangeland degradation. To understand the regulatory
   mechanisms involved in such historical social-ecological
   transformations, we collected population data on the native sheep of the
   last nomadic county in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (1961-2005).
   We detected changes in internal feedbacks (e.g., density-dependent
   effects) and external disturbance (e.g., winter harshness, rainfall,
   harvest) between the extensive and intensive management periods using
   regression models of sheep population growth rate and counterfactual
   analyses. We found that, in the extensive period, sheep populations were
   regulated during harsh winters by climate, while they were regulated
   during mild winters by negative density dependence. In the intensive
   period, the negative feedback of density dependence was removed through
   the provision of additional forage and shelter, and only winter climate
   and growing season rainfall regulated sheep populations. Counterfactual
   analyses also confirmed the irreplaceable role of density-dependence in
   maintaining a sustainable rangeland ecosystem. Although herders
   attempted to adapt to the removal of negative feedbacks by improving
   livestock harvest, overgrazing and grassland degradation remain a
   challenge in this system. We conclude that internal feedbacks within
   social-ecological systems should be carefully anticipated and accounted
   for when managing rangelands for sustainability.},

Title = {The Social-Ecological System of Farmers' Current Soil Carbon Management
   in Australian Grazing Lands},

Abstract = {Soil carbon sequestration programmes are a way of offsetting GHG
   emissions, however, it requires agricultural landholders to be engaged
   in such initiatives for carbon offsets to occur. Farmer engagement is
   low in market-based programmes for soil carbon credits in Australia. We
   interviewed long-term practitioners (n = 25) of rotational grazing in
   high-rainfall lands of New South Wales, Australia to understand their
   current social-ecological system (SES) of soil carbon management (SCM).
   The aim was to identify those components of the SES that motivate them
   to manage soil carbon and also influence their potential engagement in
   soil carbon sequestration programmes. Utilising first-tier and
   second-tier concepts from Ostrom's SES framework, the interview data
   were coded and identified a total of 51 features that characterised the
   farmers' SES of SCM. Network analysis of farmer interview data revealed
   that the current SES of SCM has low connectivity among the SES features
   (30\%). In four workshops with interviewed farmers (n = 2) and invited
   service providers (n = 2) the 51 features were reviewed and participants
   decided on the positioning and the interactions between features that
   were considered to influence SCM into a causal loop diagram.
   Post-workshop, 10 feedback loops were identified that revealed the
   different and common perspectives of farmers and service providers on
   SCM in a consolidated causal loop diagram. Defining the SES
   relationships for SCM can identify the challenges and needs of
   stakeholders, particularly farmers, which can then be addressed to
   achieve local, national and international objectives, such as SCM
   co-benefits, GHG reduction, carbon sequestration targets and SDGs.},

Title = {A past-present-future lens of environmental change: blending applied
   paleoecology and participatory system dynamics modeling at a
   conservation site in the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN CONSERVATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {4},
Month = {JAN 16},
Abstract = {Landscapes are social-ecological systems (SESs) that produce ecosystem
   services, which change over time in response to environmental, biotic,
   and social drivers. Failure to consider this variability, and the
   feedbacks that can stabilize or destabilize systems, can have
   consequences for sustainable ecosystem services provision. This study
   applies a conceptual meta-framework, past-present-future lens, to
   interpret changes in land cover and ecosystem services within the Cape
   Floristic Region (CFR) of South Africa. Paleoecology (fossil pollen,
   spores, and charcoal) and participatory system dynamics modeling were
   used to explore long-term variability in provisioning ecosystem services
   (plant biodiversity) and the drivers of this variability (fire and
   herbivory) at Elandsberg Private Nature Reserve (Elandsberg PNR). From
   ca. 1800s, the paleoecological record suggests that environmental
   changes, particularly a transition to unpalatable Elytropappus-dominated
   vegetation, were driven by grazing and that an ecological threshold was
   crossed in ca. 1950s due to agricultural intensification. Participatory
   system dynamics was used to identify feedbacks in the dynamic SES
   structure. The ecological model replicates the paleoecological results
   and, furthermore, suggests that in the future, returning the system to
   within historical ranges variability may require sustained reductions in
   both grazing and fire over decades. This innovative approach blends
   paleoecology and participatory system dynamics to provide an
   evidence-based understanding of temporal variability and feedbacks for
   policymakers and land-use managers to inform sustainable land
   management.},

Title = {Change, Collective Action, and Cultural Resilience in <i>Paramo</i>

Abstract = {This study examines how agricultural frontier expansion and grazing
   practices develop in the paramos under communal tenure in the northern
   Ecuadorian Andes and how rules to control them emerge within communal
   governance. We approach these questions through the lens of collective
   action and cultural resilience, to understand the evolution of communal
   governance. We analyze a case study of the Comitd de Paramo Nukanchik
   Urku, a multicommunal organization created in the 1990s for collective
   resource management. We use the analytical framework of
   social-ecological systems (SES) to approach changes of the agricultural
   frontiers and grazing activities as conservation outcomes resulting from
   changes in resource units, actors, and governance structures. Through a
   mixed-method approach combining air photo analysis (years 1956, 1993,
   and 2008) and qualitative research, we examine spatial patterns of
   settlement and agricultural frontier expansion, historical grazing
   practices, and the main elements of current collective paramo managemenL
   Our results indicate that: (1) the demarcation of an agreed agricultural
   frontier as a territorial landmark is a response aiming to control the
   increase of crops and dwellings at higher elevations, and to limit
   grazing activities; (2) the authority's legitimation of the Committee
   and its Board is crucial to develop rules and to enforce them; and (3)
   legitimation is achieved through conservation knowledge and autonomous
   decisions to control paramos considered a communal territory. A broader
   comprehension of the context and history of cultural change is needed to
   understand the emergence of communal governance of paramos.
   Cultural-political dimensions are key to the cultural resilience of
   social systems in SES and to strengthening rules and institutional
   diversity to manage the commons in Andean communities.},

Abstract = {The wood pastures or hardwood rangelands of the southwestern Iberian
   Peninsula are complex social-ecological systems created from the
   long-term interaction of society and the landscape. Dehesa, oak
   woodlands managed for grazing, cropping, and other forms of production,
   is the most common rangeland system and one of the most distinctive
   landscapes. Traditionally characterized by multifunctional low-intensity
   management that enhances a wide range of ecosystem services, current
   management has shifted from the traditional toward more intensified
   models. This paper assesses the coproduction of ecosystem services on
   dehesa properties by exploring the relationship between biophysical and
   sociocultural factors and dehesa management practices. Based on 42
   surveys we analyze 16 quantitative indicators using multivariate
   techniques. The results indicate that there are four main dehesa types
   as defined by their characteristics and management: large heterogeneous
   operations with diverse products; small and homogeneous operations
   focused on a reduced number of products; medium-large properties focused
   on crop production; and midsized properties with easy public access.
   Management is the result of the dynamics of interacting biophysical and
   sociocultural factors that influence manager priorities and investment.
   Management decisions group around the degree of multifunctionality of
   the operation, the relative importance of crop production, the degree of
   grazing pressure in the system, and how restrictive public access policy
   is. We find that in the study area interactions between all the
   previously mentioned elements covary consistently. generating bundles of
   ecosystem services associated with each of three management models based
   on the intensity of management. (C) 2017 The Society for Range

Abstract = {Transhumant pastoralism guided by traditional ecological knowledge (TEK)
   helps people in adapting to extreme biophysical conditions and
   remoteness in the high-altitude region of the western Himalaya. However,
   the age-old practice is currently under threat due to changes in
   socioeconomic, policy and environmental conditions, which may lead to
   erosion of pastoralism-related TEK. This study was undertaken to
   document traditional knowledge concerning transhumant pastoralism of the
   Kinnaura community in three high-altitude villages, namely Chhitkul,
   Rakchham and Batseri in the Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh, India,
   using semi-structured interviews and participant observation methods. A
   total of 38 key informants were interviewed to elicit information about
   the contemporary practices and TEK related to transhumant pastoralism.
   The study found that the transhumant pastoralism is not only intricately
   linked to sociocultural life but also contribute significantly to the
   livelihood of Kinnaura community and hired herders. Findings revealed
   that the pastoralists are the repository of vast knowledge on various
   aspects of sheep- and goat-based transhumance, viz. herd composition and
   management, grazing and supplementary feeding and ethnoveterinary
   practices. It is concluded that the study would help policy decisions
   for the preservation and protection of transhumant pastoralism-related
   TEK of the indigenous Kinnaura pastoralists. Further, considering the
   nexus between TEK and ecosystem services, this study would also
   contribute in well-being of the human society and resilience of the
   similar social-ecological systems.},

Abstract = {Background: Pastoral social-ecological systems (SESs) are adaptive and
   complex systems rooted in the extensive exploitation of forage plants
   for livestock-based livelihoods and culture. There are species and
   relations that are foundational to the existence of these SESs.
   Nucularia perrinii Batt. (Chenopodiaceae) is an endemic halophyte plant
   of central and western Sahara seldom cited in the scientific literature.
   The objective of this study was to investigate the role of this plant in
   the SES of the Sahrawi camel nomads of Western Sahara.
   Methods: The data analyzed were collected in the Sahrawi refugee camps
   of Algeria and in Western Sahara between 2006 and 2010. Fieldwork
   included semi-structured (n = 38) and retrospective (n = 12) interviews
   with Sahrawi refugees, nomads, and camel owners about N. perrinii and
   associated topics (e.g. distribution, importance for camels, camel
   diseases, associated grazing practices, other forage plants, etc.).
   Results: Askaf, as the Sahrawi call the plant, is crucial to camels'
   survival, providing salts and water even during dry spells. It holds a
   pivotal role in the Sahrawi culture, defining the geographical
   boundaries of the Sahrawi SES and relating the grazing territory with
   the taste it gives to camel milk, which support the inclusion of askaf
   as a main element of Sahrawi cultural identity.
   Conclusions: We argue that N. perrinii ties the ecology of the western
   Sahara desert with camel husbandry and associated livelihoods, and
   further with the culture and worldview of the Sahrawi nomads. We stress
   the keystone role that some forage plants may have in extensive pastoral
   SESs worldwide.},

Title = {Designing Protected Areas for Social-Ecological Sustainability:
   Effectiveness of Management Guidelines for Preserving Cultural
   Landscapes},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Rural cultural landscapes are social-ecological systems that have been
   shaped by traditional human land uses in a co-evolution process between
   nature and culture. Protected areas should be an effective way to
   protect cultural landscapes and support the way of life and the economy
   of the local population. However, nature conservation policymaking
   processes and management guidelines frequently do not take culturalness
   into account. Through a new quantitative approach, this paper analyzes
   the regulatory framework of two protected areas under different
   management categories, located in an ancient cultural landscape of the
   Madrid Region (Central Spain), to identify the similarities in their
   conservation commitments and the effectiveness of their zoning schemes.
   The results show some arbitrariness in the design and management of
   these parks, highlighting the importance of prohibited measures in their
   zoning schemes that encourage uses and activities more related to
   naturalness than to culturalness. The recognition of protected areas as
   cultural landscapes and their management considering both naturalness
   and culturalness issues are important methods of better achieving
   sustainable management objectives from a social-ecological approach.
   This methodological approach has proven useful to unravel various
   legislative content, and its application on a larger scale could reveal
   important information for the sound management of protected areas (PAs)
   in cultural landscapes.},

Abstract = {The application of payment for ecosystem services schemes to dryland
   areas has been limited, particularly for schemes that seek to improve
   the grassland upon which resource users in these landscapes depend. The
   high levels of climatic and resource variability, strength of informal
   institutions governing resource use and contested nature of resource
   decline are examples of defining characteristics that may challenge the
   application of more conventional payment for ecosystem services schemes
   in dryland contexts. We used a social-ecological systems framework to
   (i) help identify design criteria for effective and efficient payment
   for ecosystem services schemes in drylands under a pastoral land-use,
   and (ii) explore the applicability of the framework to dryland areas.
   Using eco-compensation schemes in the Chinese governed areas of the
   Eurasian steppe as a case study, we found that the framework adequately
   identified the need for non-equilibrium dynamics to be incorporated into
   scheme design. However, the framework was less able to explicitly
   enunciate the importance of micro-economics and cultural values for
   scheme viability. In contexts like the Eurasian steppe where some level
   of grazing may maximise the species richness of grasslands,
   acknowledging history of use in the resource unit subsystem component of
   the framework, not just the user subsystem component, would improve the
   framework. The explicit incorporation of contested issues into the
   framework is also needed, as dryland areas have a history of being
   misunderstood by non-dryland cultures, researchers and policymakers. We
   conclude that tailoring a general diagnostic tool towards the specific
   social-ecological attributes of the drylands under a pastoral land-use
   will improve the ability of payment for ecosystem services schemes to
   reach their conservation aims.},

Abstract = {There is rapidly growing national interest in grazing lands' soil
   health, which has beenmotivated by the current soil health renaissance
   in cropland agriculture. In contrast to intensively managed croplands,
   soil health for grazing lands, especially rangelands, is tempered by
   limited scientific evidence clearly illustrating positive feedbacks
   between soil health and grazing land resilience, or sustainability.
   Opportunities exist for improving soil health on grazing lands with
   intensively managed plant communities (e.g., pasture systems) and
   formerly cultivated or degraded lands. Therefore, the goal of this paper
   is to provide direction and recommendations for incorporating soil
   health into grazing management considerations on grazing lands. We argue
   that the current soil health renaissance should not focus on improvement
   of soil health on grazing lands where potential is limited but rather
   forward science-based management for improving grazing lands' resilience
   to environmental change via 1) refocusing grazing management on
   fundamental ecological processes (water and nutrient cycling and energy
   flow) rather than maximum short-term profit or livestock production; 2)
   emphasizing goal-based management with adaptive decision making informed
   by specific objectives incorporating maintenance of soil health at a
   minimum and directly Welevant monitoring attributes; 3) advancing
   holistic and integrated approaches for soil health that highlight
   social-ecological-economic interdependencies of these systems, with
   particular emphasis on human dimensions; 4) building cross-institutional
   partnerships on grazing lands' soil health to enhance technical
   capacities of students, land managers, and natural resource
   professionals; and 5) creating a cross-region, living laboratory network
   of case studies involving producers using soil health as part of their
   grazing land management. Collectively, these efforts could foster
   transformational changes by strengthening the link between natural
   resources stewardship and sustainable grazing lands management through
   management-science partnerships in a social-ecological systems
   framework. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Society for Range

Abstract = {The provision and utilization of grassland resources connect grassland
   ecosystems and pastoral society. Revealing the mechanism behind the
   forage supply-demand relationship and balancing forage supply and demand
   is essential in pastoral socio-ecological systems. Taking Altay
   Prefecture as the case study, this study quantified the dynamics of
   natural forage supply, artificial supplemental forage, and forage
   demand. The ratio of forage supply to demand was calculated in the
   traditional grazing scenario and the grazing prohibition and
   supplemental feeding scenario. The results showed that during 2001-2018,
   the forage supplied by natural grasslands fluctuated, with the highest
   and lowest values in 2013 and 2008, respectively. The artificial
   supplemental forage increased at a higher rate in 2011-2018 than in
   2001-2010. The overall trend of forage demand was upward, at
   approximately 2.98 x 10(4) t/a. The ratio of forage supply to demand
   decreased in the traditional scenario with an average value of 0.4717
   and increased in the grazing prohibition and supplemental feeding
   scenario with an average value of 0.8289. The influencing factors were
   analyzed from the perspective of the interactions between the
   socio-ecological system elements, and the forage supply-demand
   relationships were conceptualized based on the social-ecological system
   framework. This study concludes that natural grasslands cannot entirely
   meet the increasing forage demand without artificial supplemental
   forage. The increasing artificial supplemental forage has promoted a
   balance between forage supply and demand, indicating an optimized
   grassland utilization pattern. The factors that affect forage
   supply-demand relationships are interrelated, and a holistic perspective
   should be adopted when implementing management measures.},

Title = {Disentangling effects of climate and land-use change on West African
   drylands' forage supply},
Journal = {GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {53},

Abstract = {Livestock rearing is the most important agricultural activity in global
   drylands, making forage supply an essential ecosystem service (ES). Most
   drylands are expected to experience increasing levels of climatic
   aridity and land-use pressure in the future. As few studies account for
   combined effects of these global change drivers, we still have a limited
   understanding of how these drivers jointly shape forage supply. Here,
   the concept of social ecological systems (SESs) is useful, as it helps
   to formalize the complex interrelationships of drivers. Taking advantage
   of steep gradients of climatic aridity and land-use pressure in West
   Africa, a crossed space-for-time substitution was applied to capture
   combined effects of climate and land-use change on forage supply. We
   have operationalized the SES concept via structural equation modelling,
   and analysed how drivers directly or indirectly affected forage
   quantity, quality and their integrated proxy (metabolisable energy
   yield). Results demonstrate that contemporary dryland SESs are mainly
   controlled by land-use, which has often been used as a proxy for other
   variables, such as climatic aridity. Aridity was also directly linked to
   a higher risk of vegetation degradation, indicating that future drylands
   will be less resilient to grazing pressures. The importance of land use
   drivers for ES provision implies that sustainable grazing management
   could potentially mitigate detrimental climate change effects. However,
   model effects mediated by intermediate variables, such as aridity,
   short-term vegetation dynamics, and weather fluctuations, make it
   extremely difficult to predict climate change effects on ESs.
   Integrating structural equation modelling into the well-defined SES
   concept is thus highly useful to disentangle complex interdependencies
   of global change drivers in dryland rangelands, and to analyze drivers'
   direct and indirect effects on ESs. Our novel approach can thus foster a
   deeper understanding of patterns and mechanisms driving ecosystem
   service supply in drylands, which is essential for establishing
   sustainable management under conditions of global change.},

Title = {Social Capital and Social-Ecological Resilience in the Asteroussia
   Mountains, Southern Crete, Greece},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Social-ecological resilience (SER) expresses the capacity of a
   social-ecological system to adapt and transform. We investigated the
   ways in which different types and transformations of social capital
   influence the SER of a region. The study area, the Asteroussia Mountains
   in southern Crete, Greece, is a typical semiarid hilly/mountainous area
   of the eastern Mediterranean in which land degradation is one of the
   most important issues in land management, mostly related to overgrazing
   because of the growing size of the flocks of sheep and goats. The
   approach followed was qualitative, with in-depth interviews with a small
   number of key stakeholders in the area. The findings indicate many
   important changes in the area in terms of its production, economy, and
   society, i.e., from a ``semiarid husbandry{''} period during the 1950s
   to the early 1980s, through a transition period lasting until the end of
   1980s, to a new state, the ``subsidized husbandry{''} period, abruptly
   terminated in 2008 by the ongoing economic crisis. These changes
   correspond to important changes in social capital and very low levels of
   wider social trust among stockbreeders, while trust toward other forms
   of collective action at the local/regional level is also limited.
   Agricultural subsidies in the 1980s and onward seemed to be an important
   ``vehicle{''} for this change. Another important factor is related to
   external inputs and cash availability. The most serious negative impact
   of all these changes seems to be the abandonment of long-term care for
   the land. Primary producers ceased to associate their income with land
   quality, and this appears to be one important reason, among others, for
   the intensification of grazing densities and the abandonment of
   practices that considered vegetation and soil quality.},

Title = {Analyzing the mutual feedbacks between lake pollution and human
   behaviour in a mathematical social-ecological model},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {43},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Does the adoption of environment-oriented actions by individuals
   necessarily improve the state of an ecosystem in the most effective way?
   We address this question with the example of eutrophication in shallow
   lakes. When exposed to fertilizers, such lakes can undergo a critical
   transition called eutrophication, resulting in a loss of biodiversity
   and ecosystem services. We couple a generic model of eutrophication with
   a best-response model of human behaviour, where agents can choose to
   pollute the lake at a high level (defection) or at a low level
   (cooperation). It is known that feedbacks between the interacting lake
   pollution and human behaviour can give rise to complex dynamics with
   multiple stable states and oscillations. Here, we analyze the impact of
   all model parameters on the shape of the nullclines. S-shaped nullclines
   are a condition for complex dynamics to occur. Moreover, we find that
   agents decreasing their pollution discharge into the lake is not
   necessarily the most effective way to reduce the pollution level in the
   lake. This is due to coexisting counterintuitive stable equilibria where
   the lake is in a clear state despite a high level of pollution
   discharge. We analyze the complex dynamics of the system and describe in
   detail Hopf, saddle-node, homoclinic and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations.
   The complex dynamics with potential multistability and counterintuitive
   equilibria suggests that generic management recommendations holding for
   every level of pollution and of cooperation are impossible. Apart from
   the direct perturbation of an ecological variable, we identify three
   ways a management strategy can influence the social-ecological system:
   it can change the location, the resilience and the existence of stable
   equilibria.},

Title = {Local Residents' Social-Ecological Adaptability of the Qilian Mountain
   National Park Pilot, Northwestern China},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Protected areas are critical for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem
   services. In the last few years, there has been growing recognition of
   the role of indigenous peoples and local communities in the management
   of government designated protected areas, and thus their perceptions and
   adaptability were paid much attention. Drawing on a survey of 487
   residents in the Qilian Mountain National Park Pilot of Northwestern
   China, this study used the adaptive analysis framework to study the
   adaptability of local residents. The main contribution of this paper is
   to select a typical social-ecological system to study the adaptability
   of local residents, and using Elinor Ostrom's Social-Ecological System
   framework to analyze the adaptability mechanism. The results show that
   different types of residents had different adaptability to environmental
   change. People whose income mainly depends on work salary with a small
   part of herding have the highest level of adaptability, while people
   whose income mostly comes from farming with a small part of herding have
   the lowest level. This result is related to people's living location, as
   people living in the core zone and buffer zone of the reserve mainly
   earned from grazing, and people living in the experimental zone and
   peripheral zone earned mainly from outside work. Moreover, people living
   in the core zone and buffer zone are mostly elders and ethnic groups,
   while people in the experimental zone and buffer zone are Han people. To
   improve management effectiveness and to avoid conflict between local
   residents and managers, this paper suggests that more attention should
   be paid to these who have lived for a long time in the core zone and
   buffer zone. They are the most vulnerable groups and show low
   adaptability in almost all domains. For the long run, education quality
   should be improved to decrease the population in the reserve.},

Title = {Drivers of change in the Social-Ecological Systems of the Gwydir
   Wetlands and Macquarie Marshes in northern New South Wales, Australia},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {109-119},
Abstract = {The Murray-Darling Basin is a Social-Ecological System (SES) of major
   importance to Australia and includes extensive wetland areas in the
   north-western parts of New South Wales. The Gwydir Wetlands and the
   Macquarie Marshes are the particular focus of this paper. These two
   wetland SES have undergone five successive adaptive cycles ( phases)
   since they were first visited by Europeans in the early 19th century and
   the ecological, economic and social drivers initiating each
   transformation to a new cycle are described and analysed.
   The arrival of the European settlers with their domestic livestock
   rapidly displaced the Indigenous SES and the wetlands were extensively
   grazed; during wet periods the livestock were moved out of the wetlands
   and moved back in as the water receded. More recent land-use changes
   resulted from the building of major dams to enable storage of water for
   use in irrigated agriculture. A consequence of dam construction and
   water use has been a reduction in the frequency and extent of flooding,
   which has allowed many parts of the wetlands to be continually grazed.
   Furthermore, as machinery capable of cultivating the very heavy textured
   soils became available, dryland cropping became a major enterprise in
   areas of the floodplain where the likelihood of flooding was reduced.
   With the reduction in flooding, these wetland sites have been seriously
   degraded. The final phase has seen the invasion by an exotic weed,
   lippia {[}Phyla canescens (Kunth) Greene], which is a perennial that
   grows mat-like between other species of plants and spreads to produce a
   virtually mono-specific stand. The domestic livestock carrying capacity
   of the land becomes more or less zero and the conservation value of the
   wetlands is also dramatically decreased. Therefore, we suggest that
   lippia should be classed as an ecosystem engineer that has caused the
   latest transformation of these wetland SES and suggest research
   directions to investigate how they can be managed to revert to a state
   in which lippia is no longer dominant.},

Title = {Advancing Fire Ecology in 21st Century Rangelands},
Journal = {RANGELAND ECOLOGY \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {78},
Pages = {201-212},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Fire ecology has a long history of empirical investigation in
   rangelands. However, the science is inconclusive and incomplete,
   sparking increasing interest on how to advance the discipline. Here, we
   introduce a new framework for qualitatively and quantitatively
   understanding the ranges of variability in fire regimes typical of
   experimental investigations in rangeland fire science compared with the
   range of conditions that actually occurred during contemporary
   social-ecological times. We implement this framework for one of
   rangelands' most pyrogenic systemsdthe Great Plains of North America. We
   identify four social-ecological fire eras that have epitomized people's
   relationship with wildland fire in the Great Plains since the last
   glacial maxima. These cultural fire eras include the now-extinct
   coexistence era (indigenous fire use), the suppression era
   (extermination of wildland fire occurrence), the shadow era (localized
   prescribed burning groups), and the emerging wildfire era (resulting
   from wildland fire management failures, continued decoupling of
   human-fire ignitions, and global change). Our synthesis demonstrates
   that experimental fire conditions have not explored the types and ranges
   of variation in fire regime components responsible for shaping rangeland
   vegetationdnow, in the past, or into the future. Instead, scientific
   investigations have focused largely on controlling and minimizing
   sources of uncertainty and experimental variation, essentially
   eliminating ranges of variation that underpin the functioning of fire in
   modern social-ecological systems. Yet a series of scientific
   investigations exist that targeted a wider range of variability in fire
   regime components, leading to major advancements and the rejection of a
   number of long-standing rules of thumb in rangeland science and
   management. These include 1) the manipulation of fire return interval,
   2) the pyric herbivory experiments, and 3) the extreme fire trials. We
   discuss the general philosophy shared among these studies, introduce
   scientific standards needed to avoid common pitfalls, and highlight
   opportunities to better understand how rangeland pattern and process
   correspond to critical ranges of variation in the humanfire
   relationship. (C) 2020 The Society for Range Management. Published by

Abstract = {y In constantly changing complex social-ecological systems conservation
   organisations need to take steps toward adaptive co-management if they
   want to be effective in their conservation activities. In the
   surroundings of the soda pans of the Kiskunsag region in Hungary, a
   participatory process was initiated with the local national park
   directorate to understand the socio-economic context of the sodic
   wetland area, reveal the perceptions of local stakeholders about the
   current and preferable management of the area and start discussions with
   them about certain priority management issues related to sustainable use
   (grazing and ecotourism). In this article, we show how this process
   helped in taking the first steps toward adaptive co-management. For the
   assessment, criteria of effective adaptive co-management were derived
   from the literature. The results show that most conditions for adaptive
   co-management have already been fulfilled (e.g. identified set of
   stakeholders, sense of place shared or incentives for participation) and
   some social outcomes were achieved. The participatory process assisted
   the collaboration of stakeholders, which can contribute to positive
   economic and ecological outcomes in the future. Through the engagement
   of local stakeholders some conflicting management issues were resolved
   (e.g. accepting a wider range of grazing animal species and allowing
   flexible time for mowing) and collaboration started on ecotourism issues
   (e.g. information sharing with the assistance of the national park
   directorate). This process can be seen as the `formulation' phase of
   adaptive co-management but more efforts are needed to move toward the
   `conjoint' phase with more actions, monitoring and social learning. Our
   case also shows that ACM can be a good method for both conservation and
   rural development but supporting policy environment as well as financial
   resources assisting the participatory process and nature-friendly
   farming activities can be important for its long term success.},

Abstract = {In light of escalating threats to biodiversity, conflicts between humans
   and large carnivores in production landscapes must be resolved. We
   explore how interactions between humans, large carnivores, and livestock
   can be modified to promote coexistence. We identify four rationales for
   building coexistence capacities in extensive rangeland livestock
   production systems: (1) livestock production is a dominant terrestrial
   land use; (2) large carnivores provide critical contributions to
   ecological functions; (3) the persecution of large carnivores has high
   ethical, welfare, reputational and social costs; and (4) a growing body
   of evidence shows that lethal control can be counterproductive to
   reducing predation risk. Two key leverage points to foster
   human-carnivore coexistence are the adoption of preventive non-lethal
   innovations, and the creation of an enabling environment. Leverage
   points must be appropriate at the local landscape scale and contribute
   towards global efforts to conserve large carnivores.},

Abstract = {Holistic Management (HM) is a decision-making framework based on triple
   bottom line thinking and a proactive approach to managing complexity.
   Primarily associated with an approach to managing livestock, it has
   spurred long running and still unresolved debates in rangeland ecology
   and management. Less studied are the social, cultural, and psychological
   aspects of HM, which may hold the key to successful ecological outcomes.
   In this article, we describe the main tenets of HM as conceived by
   wildlife biologist Allan Savory and address the longstanding and
   unresolved controversy over its legitimacy. We then provide a
   meta-analysis that not only provides an up-to-date review of the
   multidisciplinary evidence and ongoing arguments about HM, but also
   provides a novel explanation for the controversy-that it is grounded in
   epistemic differences between disciplines associated with agricultural
   science that rule out any chance of resolution. We conclude that the way
   to resolve the controversy over HM is to research, in partnership with
   ranchers, rangeland social-ecological systems in more holistic,
   integrated ways. This can account for the full range of human
   experience, co-produce new knowledge, and contribute to
   social-ecological transformation.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {56},
Number = {2},
Pages = {433-446},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Management actions concerning free-roaming horses attract controversy in
   many areas. In the Chilcotin region of British Columbia, Canada, social
   and cultural values influence debates about management of free-roaming
   horses and perceptions of their ecological impacts. A dearth of current,
   empirical research on the role and impacts of horses in local ecosystems
   results in management decisions being informed largely by studies from
   other ecoregions and locations, which may not accurately represent local
   ecological, social, cultural, and economic influences. We initiated the
   first socio-ecological study of horse sub-populations, their grazing
   habitat, and past management approaches affecting current conditions in
   the ?Elegesi Qayuse Wild Horse Preserve in Xeni Gwet'in (Tsilhqot'in)
   First Nations' territory. This exploratory study used mixed methods
   including a review of literature and unpublished data, assessment of
   vegetation in core grazing habitat, and exploration of local ecological
   and cultural knowledge and perceptions. Plant community composition and
   abundance in core grazing habitat of the Wild Horse Preserve are
   consistent with a structurally sound ecosystem. Socio-cultural factors
   are important for managers to consider in effective decision-making
   concerning horse populations.},

Title = {Unlocking Lethal Dingo Management in Australia},
Journal = {DIVERSITY-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 9},
Abstract = {Adoption by livestock producers of preventive non-lethal innovations
   forms a critical pathway towards human and large carnivore coexistence.
   However, it is impeded by factors such as socio-cultural contexts,
   governing institutions, and `perverse' economic incentives that result
   in a `lock-in' of lethal control of carnivores in grazing systems. In
   Australian rangelands, the dingo is the dominant predator in conflict
   with `graziers' and is subjected to lethal control measures despite
   evidence indicating that its presence in agricultural landscapes can
   provide multiple benefits. Here we explore the barriers to the uptake of
   preventive innovations in livestock grazing through 21 in-depth
   interviews conducted with Australian graziers, researchers, and
   conservation and government representatives. Drawing on Donella Meadow's
   leverage points for system change framework, we focus, primarily, on
   barriers in the `political sphere' because they appear to form the
   greatest impediment to the adoption of non-lethal tools and practices.
   These barriers are then discussed in relation to characteristics of
   lock-in traps (self-reinforcement, persistence, path dependencies, and
   undesirability) to assess how they constrain the promotion of
   human-dingo coexistence.},

Title = {A new approach for comparing and categorizing farmers' systems of

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {274},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {FEB 24},
Abstract = {Farmers' practices are characterized not only by complexity at the farm
   scale, but also by diversity at the regional scale. In order to assess
   this diversity, a systemic approach is needed for comparing and
   classifying systems of practice. We developed a cognitive mapping
   approach (CMASOP) for comparing and clustering these systems within the
   social-ecological environment. In this paper, we introduce the two
   methods we used to implement our approach and report on the results of
   applying them in a study of grassland management in livestock grazing
   systems in Belgium. The comparison showed that systems of practice
   categorized according to certain descriptive factors (geographical,
   technical orientation) had some significant differences. The clustering
   of cognitive maps provided the basis for establishing a typology of the
   systems of practice. The comparative analysis of clusters revealed very
   significant differences among factors closer to the studied issue (grass
   forage management) than was the case with the approaches based on
   descriptive factors. Our study demonstrated that, in studies of the
   diversity of systems of practice, using a combination of statistical
   methods and semi-qualitative modelling can take account of the inherent
   complexity of these systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {226},
Pages = {321-328},

Abstract = {Horses have been associated with human societies for millennia, and for
   many have come to symbolize wildness, power, resilience, and freedom.
   Although equids were extirpated from North America 10,000-12,000 years
   ago, descendants of domestic horses now roam freely in the USA and 17
   other countries across six continents. In landscape-scale and
   experimental investigations, free-roaming horses (Equus caballus) have
   been shown to induce numerous alterations to native-ecosystem components
   and processes through influences on soil, water, plants, and other
   aspects of biodiversity. However, we argue that the management of
   free-roaming horses both in the U.S. and globally has been complicated
   by ``socio-ecological mismatches.{''} Such mismatches arise from an
   inability to reconcile conflicting processes and functions in a
   social-ecological system, often reflecting differences in the
   spatio-temporal scales at which diverse components operate. Here, we
   describe three types of mismatches, and illustrate how the ecological
   dynamics of aridlands generally fit poorly with existing approaches to
   horse management and policy. Such mismatches complicate cost-effective
   management of free-roaming horses and the ecosystems they inhabit, and
   reduce the palette of potential solutions.},

Abstract = {The multiple effects of ecosystem restoration programmes deserve
   attention. After reviewing the social-ecological effects of 23 ecosystem
   restoration programs in Asia's drylands, we find that these programmes
   mainly contribute to sustainable development goals (SDGs)
   synergistically, but the trade-offs between social-ecological effects
   still exist. Among the five goals of SDG15 (Life on Land), SDG13
   (Climate Action), SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG1 (No poverty),
   and SDG2 (Zero Hunger), 11 programs can synergistically achieve no less
   than three goals, especially grassland restoration and water diversion
   in China, as well as water management programmes in Israel. However, the
   contribution of ecosystem restoration programs to SDG15 easily weakens
   SDG6, SDG1, and SDG2, indicating the competition of land and water
   between ecosystem restoration and agriculture. To reduce the trade-offs
   among SGDs caused by ecosystem restoration, we propose the
   social-ecological system research framework of `Dryland Boundary -
   Water, Food, Energy and Ecosystem Nexus - Meta-coupling - Nature-based
   Solutions' to guide the implementation of ecosystem restoration
   programmes from four aspects: supply-demand matching, element matching,
   regional matching, and local adaptation.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the ecological-economic sustainability of coral
   reef socio-ecological systems under fishing and environmental pressures.
   To achieve this, a dynamic, spatially explicit, multi-species,
   multi-fleet fisheries model is developed. Stochastic environmental
   shocks are assumed to alter coral cover and consequently the entire
   coral reef social-ecological system. The model is calibrated using
   ecological, socio-economic and environmental data in French Polynesia.
   Four exploratory fishing strategies and a goal-seeking strategy entitled
   Stochastic Multi-Species Maximum Sustainable Yield (SMMSY) are compared
   in terms of ecological-economic outcomes and sustainability of the
   socio-ecological system. The SMMSY turns out to promote
   ecological-economic sustainability. It is characterised by a global
   increase in fishing effort pointing to the relative current
   under-exploitation of the fishery. SMMSY balances the trophic level of
   catches after natural shocks and sustains the fundamental herbivore
   grazing process. SMMSY strategies are also more diversified in terms of
   temporality, gears, spatial distribution of fishing and target species.},

Abstract = {Mountain rangelands are critical resources for mobile pastoralists, and
   they provide benefits to humankind broadly. Yet mountain pastoral
   social-ecological systems (SESs) face challenges that affect both
   mountains and rangelands. Herders' traditional ecological knowledge
   (TEK) underpins their adaptive strategies and serves as a resource for
   future adaptation. This holistic case study of Ilemchane transhumant
   herders in Morocco's High Atlas Mountains applies a simple framework to
   explore how herders' biophysical TEK, practices, and institutions
   interrelate and how climate and social changes affect the SES. Using
   participant observation, interviews, and surveys, we find Ilemchane
   climate, plant, and ecological knowledge shape their practices and
   institutions, which in turn reinforce or alter TEK. Building on a recent
   synthesis of mountain SES, we identify a paradox of remoteness, wherein
   Ilemchane remoteness both maintains traditional transhumant culture and
   TEK and threatens it. Overcoming this paradox may require internal
   organization, collective action, and external support.},

Title = {Tsetse Invasion as an Emerging Threat to Socioecological Resilience of
   Pastoral Communities in Karamoja, Uganda},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB 2},
Abstract = {Over 70\% of Uganda is infested by the tsetse fly, which has negative
   effects on human and livestock health. From colonial to post-independent
   Uganda, the Government of Uganda has worked to eradicate the tsetse
   menace. Despite these efforts, recent veterinary reports from the
   Karamoja sub-region have indicated widespread tsetse invasion. This
   study investigated the potential impact of tsetse invasion on the
   socioecological resilience of pastoral communities in the Karamoja
   sub-region. Results indicated that tsetse invasion is spreading from
   north to south of Karamoja. The tsetse transmission route emerging from
   southern Karamoja is perceived to be a continuation of the tsetse belt
   from West Pokot, Kenya. Cases of livestock deaths, livestock abortions,
   decreased milk yields, restricted access to prime grazing lands,
   heightened human-wildlife conflicts and disruption on crop cultivation
   have been reported. A computed socioecological resilience index in the
   study area was positive but low. Owing to the transboundary
   characteristics of tsetse invasions and sources and the associated
   documented effects, an urgent, strategic and system-wide intervention
   should be undertaken to control the tsetse invasion in this sub-region.},

Title = {Combining ecohydrologic and transition probability-based modeling to
   simulate vegetation dynamics in a semi-arid rangeland},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {329},
Pages = {41-63},
Month = {JUN 10},
Abstract = {Drylands support pastoralist social-ecological systems around the world.
   Ecological function in these water-limited environments frequently
   depends on tightly coupled, nonlinear interactions between water, soil,
   vegetation, and herbivores. Numerous complexity-based approaches have
   modeled localized ecohydrological feedbacks to yield insights into
   dryland landscape organization and emergent dynamics. The relevance of
   these models to management and sustainability continues to increase as
   researchers incorporate ecological processes at multiple scales and
   social-ecological variables like herding practices. However, many
   processes vary in their importance depending on ecological context, so
   there is a continuing need to construct models tailored to different
   contexts. We developed a model for semiarid rangelands that experience
   highly variable rainfall, substantial Hortonian runoff during rain
   events, patchy vegetation structure, and grazing-influenced patch
   transitions. The model couples an existing, mechanistic cellular
   automata model of hillslope water balance with a dynamic vegetation
   model in which probabilistic transitions between bare, annual grass,
   perennial grass patches depend on soil moisture and grazing intensity.
   The model was parameterized based on a field site in Kenya, from which
   we had empirical hydrological measurements and several years of
   patch-to-hillslope scale measurements of vegetation structure. The model
   domain is a 100 x 100 grid of 2 x 2 m cells, it simulates seasonal
   cycles of growing seasons followed by dry seasons, and it computes daily
   soil moisture based on stochastic rainfall forcings. Patch type
   transitions can occur twice during each seasonal cycle: at the end of
   the growing season, with probabilities based on average growing-season
   soil moisture availability; and at the end of the dry season, with
   probabilities based on grazing intensity and antecedent growing-season
   soil moisture. By parameterizing grazing intensity as a per-patch
   impact, it can be interpreted as the degree of forage depletion at which
   a herder decides to leave the area. We conducted a series of simulation
   experiments, principally altering runoff channelization and grazing
   intensity. The model generated plausible vegetation dynamics across the
   range of grazing intensities simulated. Vegetation cover fluctuated
   seasonally,. but never collapsed completely, even at the highest grazing
   intensity. At low to intermediate grazing, we observed multi-decadal
   switches in fractional perennial cover, triggered by periods of below-
   or above-average rainfall. At low to intermediate grazing intensities,
   we noted emergent spatial patterning in the form of a step-like increase
   in vegetation density in the lower half of the domain. With a vegetation
   patch transitions governed by mechanistic water balance dynamics as well
   as grazing intensities that represent herder decision-making, the model
   holds great potential for further explorations of how land use, climate,
   and spatial heterogeneity affect the functioning of a dryland
   pastoralist social-ecological system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {The management of communal pastures and wells has become a standard
   topic of research on pastoral societies and on the theory of common pool
   resource management. The paper sets our to disCUSS the history of
   scientific engagement with pastoral land tenure: after a focus on
   overstocking and degradation caused by irrational accumulating
   behaviour, the ``tragedy of the commons{''} became an important and
   politically influential narrative paving the way for the dismantling of
   pastoral commons. In recent years non-equilibrium qualities of savannah
   environments and well adapted local knowledge on the grazing vegetation
   were highlighted. The paper then sketches the management of common pool
   resources by the pastoral Pokor of north-western Kenya over a century.
   It is argued that institutions of common pool resource management
   changed profoundly according to specific political and ecological
   ramifications. Such changes astonishingly have not been the result Of
   incremental change but have been rather abrupt. Major perturbations of
   the social-ecological system (violence, drought) Contributed to Sudden

Abstract = {The ecology has witnessed a strong conceptual shift regarding the
   transition from human-free to human dominated ecosystems. Nevertheless,
   human beings are still treated as exogenous factors in many ecological
   studies. Human activity can reasonably be assumed to influence many
   processes and patterns studied in ecology at different spatial and
   temporal scales. Thus, trying to predict the future of ecosystems while
   ignoring the influence of human activities is neither realistic nor
   useful. We argue that a successful integration effort in traditional
   ecology must result from a theoretical and/or conceptual change. A
   logical and intuitive theoretical leap should be one that considers
   human actions in light of an integrative scenario. In the first part of
   this article, we discuss the need for conceptual, theoretical, and
   methodological changes in studies focusing on the idea of chronic
   anthropogenic disturbances. In the second part, we introduce the Niche
   Construction Theory (NCT) as an integrative scenario accommodating these
   theoretical and conceptual changes in studies that investigate human
   actions in the environment. To exemplify our argument, we present a case
   study resulting from our research and focusing on the cascading effects
   of human activities and their multilevel and multiscale influences in
   the landscape. (C) 2018 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e

Abstract = {Coexistence between livestock grazing and carnivores in rangelands is a
   major challenge in terms of sustainable agriculture, animal welfare,
   species conservation and ecosystem function. Many effective non-lethal
   tools exist to protect livestock from predation, yet their adoption
   remains limited. Using a social-ecological transformations framework, we
   present two qualitative models that depict transformative change in
   rangelands grazing. Developed through participatory processes with
   stakeholders from South Africa and the United States of America, the
   models articulate drivers of change and the essential pathways to
   transition from routine lethal management of carnivores towards mutually
   beneficial coexistence. The pathways define broad actions that
   incorporate multiple values in grazing systems including changes to
   livestock management practices, financial support, industry capacity
   building, research, improved governance and marketing initiatives. A key
   finding is the new concept of `Predator Smart Farming', a holistic and
   conscientious approach to agriculture, which increases the resilience of
   landscapes, animals (domesticated and wild) and rural livelihoods.
   Implementation of these multiple pathways would lead to a future system
   that ensures thriving agricultural communities, secure livelihoods,
   reduced violence toward animals, and landscapes that are productive and
   support species conservation and coexistence.},

Abstract = {The decline or loss of traditional social-ecological systems may induce
   adverse effects to the societies and ecosystems. Transhumance, the
   recurring and seasonal movement of grazing livestock, is increasingly
   constrained by a numbers of factors including policy, land use and
   socio-economic changes in Nepal. To explore how these changes have
   affected the transhumance, this study investigated transhumance at the
   Langtang valley in central Nepal. The specific objectives of this study
   were to determine the herd size and composition, spatial-temporal
   patterns and to identify the major drivers of the system and the system
   changes. Data were collected from field study comprising semi-structured
   interviews with the herders, focus group discussions, key informants
   survey, and observations of rangeland and livestock management systems.
   The study revealed that the transhumance system in the Langtang is
   influenced by two types of drivers. In one hand, traditional practices
   are contributing to the sustainability of the system. On the other hand,
   the grazing patterns and adaptive responses are strongly influenced by
   changes in government policies, socioeconomic and cultural
   transformation, livestock productivity, markets, rangeland conditions
   and climate change. The findings of this study help with the development
   and implementation of transhumance management policy for the
   sustainability.},

Journal = {COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {39},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {396-411},
Abstract = {Parrotfish play two important roles in coral reef social-ecological
   systems; first as important sources of food for reef dependent people,
   and second by underpinning the ecological function of herbivory (i.e.,
   grazing of algae) on coral reefs. Overfishing of herbivores can be
   detrimental to coral reef ecosystems because their removal may allow
   algae to outcompete corals. However, little is known about the drivers
   behind the exploitation of parrotfish. We describe the trade of
   parrotfish in Zanzibar with the aim to visualize the linkages between
   ecological function, market price, and socioeconomic drivers behind
   their exploitation. Three interesting findings emerge. First, parrotfish
   are an important part of the fish trade in Zanzibar and are traded at
   all market scales (from local consumers to international tourists).
   Second, size is an important determinant of price, with larger fish
   generating much higher values. Third, size determines which market
   parrotfish are sold to. Overall the study shows that all sizes of
   parrotfish are exposed to exploitation, leaving no size-refuge for
   escaping harvest. In light of an increasing global demand and high
   market prices, we thus propose that traditional fisheries management be
   complemented with assessments of both ecological understanding and
   socioeconomic dynamics to take into account of global market drivers
   behind parrotfish exploitation at local scales.},

Abstract = {Droughts can have serious ecological and economic consequences and will
   pose an increasing challenge to rangeland users as the global climate is
   changing. Finding ways to reduce ecological and economic impacts of
   drought should thus be a major research thrust. Resilience, defined as
   the amount of perturbation a social or ecological system can absorb
   without shifting to a qualitatively different state, has emerged as a
   prominent concept in ecosystem ecology and more recently as a conceptual
   framework for understanding and managing complex social-ecological
   systems. This paper discusses the application and relevance of
   resilience to understanding and managing ecosystem change, and enhancing
   the capacity of land users to adapt to droughts. Drought can trigger
   vegetation change and factors such as grazing management can influence
   the likelihood of such transitions. Drought can cause differential
   mortality of perennial plants and this could provide an opportunity for
   rangeland restoration by opening up establishment sites for desirable
   species. The capacity of land users to cope with drought is influenced
   by the resilience of their agro-ecosystems, the diversity of livelihood
   options, access to resources and institutional support. By these
   criteria, current agricultural development approaches in South Africa,
   particularly in communal rangelands and areas of land reform, are
   unlikely to enhance land users' resilience to drought and other
   perturbations.},

Title = {Competition on the range: science vs. perception in a bison-cattle
   conflict in the western USA},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {52},
Number = {2},
Pages = {467-474},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {1. Competition between livestock and wild ungulates is commonly
   perceived to occur on shared rangelands. In the Henry Mountains (HM) of
   Utah, a free-ranging population of bison Bison bison has raised concerns
   among ranchers holding grazing permits on these public lands. Bison are
   the most conspicuous potential competitors with cattle, but lagomorphs
   (mainly jackrabbits Lepus californicus) are also abundant in this area.
   The local ranching community is applying political pressure on state and
   federal agencies to resolve `the bison problem', but the relative
   grazing impacts of bison, cattle and lagomorphs have not previously been
   quantified.
   2. We constructed 40 grazing exclosures (each 5.95 m(2)) in the conflict
   area: 20 excluded bison + cattle ('partial') and 20 excluded bison +
   cattle + lagomorphs ('full'). All exclosures, each with a paired open
   reference plot, were monitored for 1 year, and above-ground plant
   production was measured. GPS telemetry (bison) and scheduled grazing
   (cattle) allowed visitation to be quantified for each ungulate species
   based on the number of `animal days' in the area. Rancher perceptions of
   wildlife-cattle interactions were recorded in a questionnaire survey.
   3. Ranchers perceived bison as a high-level competitor with cattle,
   whereas lagomorphs were perceived as low-level competitors.
   4. Grazed reference plots yielded an average (+/- SE) of 22.7 g m(-2)
   (+/- 5.16) of grass, compared to 36.5 g m(-2) (+/- 7.33) in the partial
   exclosures and 43.7 g m(-2) (+/- 7.61) in the full exclosures. Exclusion
   of large herbivores thus resulted in a 13.8 g m(-2) increase in grass
   biomass relative to the reference plots (P = 0.005), with the additional
   exclusion of lagomorphs resulting in a further 7.18 g m(-2) increase (P
   = 0.048).
   5. Overall, lagomorphs accounted for 34.1\%, bison 13.7\% and cattle
   52.3\% of the total grass biomass removed by all herbivores on the
   shared range.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Cattle face a greater competitive
   challenge from lagomorphs than from bison in the study area. This case
   study illustrates the need for science-based management of
   social-ecological systems in which even long-term resource users might
   underestimate the complexities of trophic interactions. Attention should
   be redirected at the lagomorphs and their main predators, coyotes Canis
   latrans, which are currently subject to population control. To reduce
   negative perceptions among local ranchers, options should be explored to
   incorporate benefit-sharing into the management of the bison population.},

Abstract = {Resource-dependent communities are likely to be disproportionately
   affected by climate change. Yet, natural resource management policies
   continue to be developed and implemented without considering climate
   change adaptation. We highlight that this lack of coordination is
   potentially harmful to natural resources and resource-dependent
   communities with an example from the Tibetan Plateau, a region where
   climate is changing rapidly. Tibetan pastoralists inhabit rangelands
   that are the focus of recent development and management policies that
   promote fencing, sedentarization, individual rangeland use rights, and
   the elimination of grazing in some areas. These policies may have a
   negative effect on herders' ability to adapt to climate change. China's
   National Climate Change Programme lists controlling or eliminating
   grazing in some areas as key for adaptation to climate change, but
   experimental results indicate that grazing may buffer the rangelands
   from the negative effects of warming. These findings indicate that
   policies that support the well-developed strategies of
   resource-dependent communities for living in uncertain and variable
   environments can also enhance adaptation of these social and ecological
   systems to climate change. We conclude that management and environmental
   protection policies developed separately from climate change policy face
   increased failure potential and may decrease the ability of natural
   resources and the communities that depend upon them to successfully
   adapt to climate change.},

Abstract = {This study coins the reality-worldview framework to examine
   park-community conflicts arising from the expediency to protect the
   environmental integrity of a South African national park from
   bio-invasion. The study used remote sensing data to investigate the
   state of vegetation cover along the northern fringes of the park and an
   adjacent communal grazing area to determine differences in plant based
   resource endowments between the two areas. The study also involved the
   discriminant analysis of survey responses from park officials and local
   communities regarding perceptions about the environmental impacts of
   Acacia mearnsii invasion, as well as how the species spreads and how the
   species can be controlled. The objective of the study was to assess
   park-community conflicts arising from initiatives to limit community
   access to park resources on the justification of the need to prevent the
   invasion of the park by A. mearnsii. The study concludes that even
   though uncontrolled movement of people and livestock creates the obvious
   danger of invasion of the park by the species, the extent to which the
   species is viewed as an environmental threat depends on the worldviews
   of the stakeholders, the bridging of which can only be achieved through
   negotiation, environmental awareness and education campaigns and
   provision of training in conflict resolution to the belligerents.},

Title = {Changing landowners, changing ecosystem? Land-ownership motivations as
   drivers of land management practices},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {133},
Pages = {144-152},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Motivations for owning rural land are shifting from an
   agricultural-production orientation to a preference for natural and
   cultural amenities. Resultant changes in land management have
   significant implications for the type and distribution of
   landscape-level disturbances that affect the delivery of ecosystem
   services. We examined the relationship between motivations for owning
   land and the implementation of conservation land management practices by
   landowners in the Southern Great Plains of the United States. Using a
   mail survey, we classified landowners into three groups: agricultural
   production, multiple-objective, and lifestyle-oriented. Cross
   tabulations of landowner group with past, current, and future use of 12
   different land management practices (related to prescribed grazing,
   vegetation management, restoration, and water management) found that
   lifestyle-oriented landowners were overall less likely to adopt these
   practices. To the degree that the cultural landscape of rural lands
   transitions from production-oriented to lifestyle-oriented landowners,
   the ecological landscape and the associated flow of ecosystem services
   will likely change. This poses new challenges to natural resource
   managers regarding education, outreach, and policy; however, a better
   understanding about the net ecological consequences of lower rates of
   adoption of conservation management practices requires consideration of
   the ecological tradeoffs associated with the changing resource
   dependency of rural landowners. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   China},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},

Abstract = {Grazing behavior is a key factor that affects the sustainable
   development of the grassland social-ecological system. Grazing behavior
   is not only restricted by policies but also affected by the awareness of
   the herder of the grassland environment. To explore the influencing
   factors and mechanism behind grazing behavior, Yanchi County of Ningxia,
   a typical area of the ``returning grazing land to grassland `` project
   in Northwest China, was selected as a study area. Based on the
   consciousness-context-behavior theory, a questionnaire was designed, and
   305 households were surveyed. Analysis of structural equation model
   results show: (1) the environmental sensitivity of herders and their
   satisfaction with the compensation mechanism regulated grazing behavior.
   When herders were more dependent on grassland, they were more willing to
   graze. (2) The grassland dependence, environmental sensitivity of
   herders, and herders' satisfaction with the compensation mechanism had a
   significant interaction effect on grazing behavior. (3) Family
   livelihood diversification and the number of young and middle-aged
   laborers had a significant moderating effect on grassland dependence and
   grazing behavior. These findings are of vital importance for the
   government to formulate policies to promote the sustainable development
   of grasslands.},

Title = {Conflict resolution through ecosystem-based management: the case of
   Swedish moose management},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Pages = {549-570},
Abstract = {Swedish moose (Alces alces) management has over the years transformed
   from a situation similar to what Hardin (1968) defined as a tragedy of
   the commons - i.e. where open access and unrestricted demands lead to
   over-exploitation - into a situation characterized by an abundance of
   moose. While high numbers of moose are preferred by hunters, they damage
   forests through grazing, causing conflicts between hunters and forest
   owners. In an attempt to resolve these disputes, the Swedish government
   is introducing a new local ecosystem-based management system. This paper
   analyzes this shift from managing a single resource to the broader
   perspective of ecosystem management and discusses to what extent it will
   contribute to conflict resolution. The results suggest that some of the
   problems highlighted may be solved through the implementation of an
   ecosystem management system. However, several challenges remain to be
   tackled, such as how to establish robust partnerships between forest
   owners and hunters for managing moose on land with a fragmented property
   rights structure. This can lead to different and conflicting objectives
   and, consequently, difficulties in reaching collective action.},

Abstract = {Win-win solutions might be short-lived. Government permission for
   smallholder farmers to extract and sell resin from a pine savanna
   biosphere-reserve in Mexico has settled a long dispute among different
   stakeholders in the short-term; however, forest production and
   conservation beyond 20 years are compromised due to low pine recruitment
   caused by competition with exotic grasses. Grass control practiced by
   farmers through grazing and fire has previously been discouraged by
   conservation authorities, which inadvertently limits long-term pine
   conservation and use. We describe the participatory design, rationale
   and simulation attributes of an educational, interactive, agent-based
   model that explores suites of management options and their economic and
   ecological outputs. We present and analyze the outcomes of four
   simulation workshops, where farmers and external-actors better grasped
   the complex ecological interactions involved in conserving and using
   pines in grazed pine savanna with exotic grasses, and discussed these
   findings with a long-term vision and tradeoff analysis approach. (c)

Abstract = {Rangelands provide several valuable ecological services and provide for
   the livelihoods of local herders on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP).
   However, rangelands are being degraded due to overgrazing, policy
   changes and climate change. In this context, a survey was conducted in
   Zhuaxixiulong township of Gansu Province, China to examine the rangeland
   management systems and identify problems herders are facing in terms of
   livestock production and livelihoods using a Participatory Rural
   Appraisal approach. The results indicated that local herders perceived
   recent trends in rangeland degradation, climatic change, and political
   changes, and had developed management practices to adapt to these
   changes, such as adjusting transhumance patterns, cooperating with local
   institutions and adopting more collective actions in production
   practices. This study suggests that, to promote a sustainable rangeland
   management system in the QTP, policy-makers should recognise indigenous
   knowledge systems of grazing practices and rangeland management, as well
   as the need for more advanced technical methods. More attention should
   be paid to recent changes in climate, social transformations and
   economic changes to enhance the viability of such a pastoral society. To
   ensure the sustainability of the social-ecological system, there is a
   need to strengthen public participation and cooperation with all types
   of institutions to formulate appropriate policies and improve public
   services.},

Title = {Rangeland Livelihood Strategies under Varying Climate Regimes: Model
   Insights from Southern Kenya},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Rangelands throughout sub-Saharan Africa are currently undergoing two
   major pressures: climate change (through altered rainfall and
   seasonality patterns) and habitat fragmentation (brought by land use
   change driven by land demand for agriculture and conservation). Here we
   explore these dimensions, investigating the impact of land use change
   decisions, by pastoralists in southern Kenya rangelands, on human
   well-being and animal densities using an agent-based model. The
   constructed agent-based model uses input biomass data simulated by the
   Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ-GUESS) dynamic
   vegetation model and parameterized with data from literature. Scenarios
   of land use change under different rainfall years, land tenure types and
   levels of wildlife conservation support were simulated. Reflecting
   reality, our results show livestock grazing as the predominant land use
   that changes with precipitation and land tenure leading to varying
   livelihood strategies. For example, agriculture is the most common
   livelihood in wet years and conservation levels increase with increasing
   support of wildlife conservation initiatives. Our model demonstrates the
   complex and multiple interactions between pastoralists, land management
   and the environment. We highlight the importance of understanding the
   conditions driving the sustainability of semi-arid rangelands and the
   communities they support, and the role of external actors, such as
   wildlife conservation investors, in East Africa.},

Journal = {ECOSPHERE},

Abstract = {Human-induced ecological boundaries, or anthropogenic ecotones, may
   arise where administrative boundaries meet on undeveloped lands.
   Landscape-level ecological processes related to factors such as fire,
   invasive species, grazing, resource extraction, wildlife, and water may
   be affected due to unique management strategies adopted by each
   administrative unit. Over time, different management can result in
   discernible ecological differences (e.g., species composition or soil
   characteristics). Thus, fragmentation in the management landscape can
   correspond to ecological fragmentation. Different ecological patterns
   may emerge due to an increase in the number of management units in a
   region, or due to an increase in the number of different types of
   management units in the region. Temporal effects and collaboration
   history can also affect the emergence of ecotones. We use conceptual
   models to explore the relationship between these aspects of management
   fragmentation and the anthropogenic ecotones between management parcels.
   We then use examples of different management challenges to explore how
   anthropogenic ecotones can disrupt ecological flows. Our models suggest
   that cross-boundary collaboration that enhances management connectivity
   is likely essential to ecological connectivity in the face of
   environmental and social change.},

Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Reviewing and synthesizing how an interdisciplinary network perspective
   can inform on governance and adaptation processes in regions undergoing
   rapid social-, economical-, and environmental changes.
   Increasing and intensifying the use of land represents a prominent
   sustainability challenge of particular importance in regions undergoing
   rapid change while at the same time exhibiting large natural and
   anthropocentrically induced variability. To reconcile the needs for both
   human prosperity and healthy ecosystems, a more integrated understanding
   of key biophysical and adaptation processes is paramount in such dynamic
   and deeply entangled social and environmental contexts.
   Interdisciplinary research utilizing a network perspective provides a
   novel methodological and theoretical approach to that end. We review and
   synthesize recent network-centric studies, and use this network
   perspective to show how rangeland managers in a dynamic pastoral region
   in the Qinghai Province of China form social relationships based on
   geographic proximity, social status and shared grazing areas. The
   results indicate that adaption to biophysical and socioeconomic changes
   is partly a social process in that rangeland managers develop their
   adaptive capacity jointly and in concert with others they trust and with
   whom they share grazing areas. Avenues for further development of this
   network perspective, in terms of how it might contribute important new
   insights about how to sustainably use land in dynamic landscapes
   undergoing rapid change, are suggested.},

Title = {Kenyan pastoralist societies in transition: varying perceptions of the
   value of ecosystem services},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {In the drylands of northern Kenya, as elsewhere in Africa, traditional
   pastoralist social-ecological systems are undergoing profound
   transformations. Diminishing resource availability, changing social
   values and governance systems, and new resource management institutions
   challenge the capacity of communities for effective common pool resource
   management. Individuals' values and environmental perceptions play a
   substantial role in decision making regarding resource use and
   management. Additionally, social capital within communities can
   influence cooperative and adaptive resource management. We studied five
   Laikipia Maasai communities in Kenya, which share a common natural
   environment, history, and political organization. We surveyed
   pastoralists' perceptions of the adequacy of two ecosystem services,
   forage availability and livestock abundance. We also assessed indicators
   of three forms of social capital: reciprocity, sanctioning, and norms of
   fairness. Four communities established set-aside conservation areas
   through partnership with external organizations. In those communities,
   we examined residents' perceptions of five different potential
   ecological and economic benefits from the conservation areas. We found
   that communities varied in residents' perceptions of grazing resource
   adequacy, the economic sufficiency of their livestock herds, and the
   benefits of conservation areas. Communities also varied in measures of
   social capital. We contextualize our findings in terms of the rules and
   conditions governing each conservation area, the roles of social
   capital, and the challenges of resource-use trade-offs when perceptions
   diverge. We conclude that taking stock of perceptions and values placed
   on ecosystem services is a crucial element of formulating plans for
   sustainable resource management and navigating trade-offs in the future.},

Title = {Engaging society and building participatory governance in a rural

Journal = {ANTHROPOCENE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {37},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Although the Anthropocene has heralded unprecedented recognition of, and
   concern about the consequences of landscape degradation to humans,
   pathways to effective long-term landscape restoration remain uncertain.
   Restoration is a human activity that resists negative trajectories of
   environmental change, whereas participatory governance involves
   relationality between those entrusted with formal governance of natural
   resources and those who directly use, benefit from, and impact on
   natural resources. This paper outlines the transdisciplinary approach of
   the Tsitsa Project in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa to
   restore a degraded rural landscape. The project aspires ``To support
   sustainable livelihoods for local people through integrated landscape
   management that strives for resilient social-ecological systems, and
   which fosters equity in access to ecosystem services{''}. In the
   project, landscape management has included extensive restoration aimed
   to reduce erosion, increase grazing vegetation-cover, and reduce river
   silt loads. It has also involved engagement in a reflexive learning
   process with local residents, government officials and traditional
   leaders to derive a Capability Pathway for the development of
   participatory governance. A foundational step, Co-Knowing, initiates the
   pathway. The concept of epistemic justice guided the goal of fair
   inclusion among participants, the development of a shared vocabulary and
   the conceptual understanding required for local people to move towards
   real governance participation. Narratives from stakeholders provide
   evidence that the process is building participatory governance agency.
   These approaches provide credible evidence for the value of building
   participatory governance capabilities as a foundation for long-term
   restoration outcomes.},

Title = {Social institution changes and their ecological impacts in Kazakhstan
   over the past hundred years},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Over the past 100 years, the social system, agricultural production
   modes, lifestyles, and ecological conditions in Kazakhstan have changed
   dramatically. Understanding how social institution changes altered the
   land use patterns and the ecosystem processes in Kazakhstan can provide
   important knowledge for the sustainable ecological management of
   semi-arid regions. By summarizing the documented research on major
   social institution reforms, this study investigated land use changes in
   response to social system changes and analyzed the impacts of
   agricultural and animal husbandry development on ecological degradation.
   Three important characteristics of social-ecological system changes were
   found in this study. First, population migration, land policy changes,
   and social system reform were the major driving factors of ecological
   degradation, especially within the periods of Russian emigration in the
   early 20th century, the Virgin Lands Campaign, and the collapse of the
   Soviet Union. Second, changes in land use patterns caused by changes in
   social systems have led to a series of ecological degradation,
   especially the policy of collective management and regional intensive
   grazing. Land experiencing reclamationabandonment-reclamation turbulence
   developed in a vicious cycle and eventually became a highrisk area of
   ecological degradation. Third, Kazakhstan experienced a long-term
   cultivated land expansion, occupying high-quality grassland and pastoral
   areas, which moved animal husbandry production to desert vegetation
   areas. The agro-pastoral transition zone in Kazakhstan was the mostly
   affected area by land use changes due to the social institutional
   changes and special attention is urgently needed to reduce land
   degradation and desertification.},

   learning and adaptation in the long term. However, simply bringing
   together diverse stakeholders does not guarantee productive engagement.
   Using critical discourse analysis, we examined how diverse stakeholders
   negotiated knowledge and power in a workshop designed to inform adaptive
   management of riparian livestock grazing on a National Forest in the
   southwestern USA. Publicly recognized as a successful component of a
   larger collaborative effort, we found that the workshop effectively
   brought together diverse participants, yet still restricted dialogue in
   important ways. Notably, workshop facilitators took on the additional
   roles of riparian experts and instructors. As they guided workshop
   participants toward a consensus view of riparian conditions and
   management recommendations, they used their status as riparian experts
   to emphasize commonalities with stakeholders supportive of riparian
   grazing and accentuate differences with stakeholders skeptical of
   riparian grazing, including some Forest Service staff with power to
   influence management decisions. Ultimately, the management plan
   published one year later did not fully adopt the consensus view from the
   workshop, but rather included and acknowledged a broader diversity of
   stakeholder perspectives. Our findings suggest that leaders and
   facilitators of adaptive collaborative management can more effectively
   manage for productive stakeholder engagement and, thus,
   social-ecological resilience if they are more tentative in their
   convictions, more critical of the role of expert knowledge, and more
   attentive to the knowledge, interests, and power of diverse
   stakeholders.},

Title = {Australian pastoralists in time and space: The evolution of a complex
   adaptive system},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Newcomers and exotic livestock have displaced indigenous
   hunter-gatherers from Australia's drylands over the past 200 yr. This
   paper seeks to learn from and explain the adaptive process involving the
   initially nave newcomers, their stock, and Australia's ancient
   landscapes. We review pastoral adaptation at the national, regional, and
   enterprise scales. These scales are linked, and so we use ``panarchy{''}
   theory with its concept of ``adaptive cycles{''} as an analytical
   framework. Past pastoral adaptation can be summarized by changes in key
   linkages: pastoralists (1) are now connected to more individuals than
   when they first moved into the rangelands, but are less reliant on local
   hubs for these connections; (2) have weaker links to the environment as
   environmental feedbacks have been reduced; (3) have stronger links to
   alternate land uses, but weaker links to governance; and (4) have
   stronger links to the global economy. Further change is inevitable.
   Pastoralism is likely to remain as the core activity in Australian
   rangelands, but the dynamic linkages that shape the system will, in
   future, connect pastoralists more strongly to post-production economies,
   information and more distant social networks, and to a more diverse
   group of land users.},

Abstract = {Recovery and conservation of threatened species require adequate
   institutional responses. We tested an approach to systematically
   identify and measure how an institutional framework acknowledges threats
   and required responses for the recovery of endangered species. We
   measured institutional functional fit with a
   drivers-pressure-state-impacts-response (DPSIR) model integrated with a
   quantitative text mining method and qualitative analysis of statutory
   instruments to examine regulatory responses that support the recovery of
   2 endangered species native to Australia, the bridled nailtail wallaby
   (Onychogalea fraenata) and the Eastern Bristlebird (Dasyornis
   brachypterus). The key components of the DPSIR model were present in the
   institutional framework at statutory and operational levels, but some
   institutional gaps remained in the protection and recovery of the
   Eastern Bristlebird, including feral predator control, weed control, and
   grazing management in some locations. However, regulatory frameworks
   varied in their geographic scope and the application and implementation
   of many instruments remained optional. Quantitative text mining can be
   used to quickly navigate a large volume of regulatory documents, but
   challenges remain in selection of terms, queries of co-occurrence, and
   interpretation of word frequency counts. To inform policy, we recommend
   that quantitative assessments of institutional fit be complemented with
   qualitative analysis and interpreted in light of the sociopolitical and
   institutional context.},

Abstract = {The articles in this special feature challenge the presumption that
   scholars can make simple, predictive models of social-ecological systems
   (SESs) and deduce universal solutions, panaceas, to problems of overuse
   or destruction of resources. Moving beyond panaceas to develop
   cumulative capacities to diagnose the problems and potentialities of
   linked SESs requires serious study of complex, multivariable, nonlinear,
   cross-scale, and changing systems. Many variables have been identified
   by researchers as affecting the patterns of interactions and outcomes
   observed in empirical studies of SESs. A step toward developing a
   diagnostic method is taken by organizing these variables in a nested,
   multitier framework. The framework enables scholars to organize analyses
   of how attributes of (i) a resource system (e.g., fishery, lake, grazing
   area), (ii) the resource units generated by that system (e.g., fish,
   water, fodder), (iii) the users of that system, and (iv) the governance
   system jointly affect and are indirectly affected by interactions and
   resulting outcomes achieved at a particular time and place. The
   framework also enables us to organize how these attributes may affect
   and be affected by larger socioeconomic, political, and ecological
   settings in which they are embedded, as well as smaller ones. The
   framework is intended to be a step toward building a strong
   interdisciplinary science of complex, multilevel systems that will
   enable future diagnosticians to match governance arrangements to
   specific problems embedded in a social-ecological context.},

Title = {Holistic Management and Adaptive Grazing: A Trainers' View},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Holistic Management (HM) is a grazing practice that typically uses
   high-intensity rotation of animals through many paddocks, continually
   adapted through planning and monitoring. Despite widespread disagreement
   about the environmental and production benefits of HM, researchers from
   both sides of that debate seem to agree that its emphasis on
   goal-setting, complexity, adaptivity and strategic decision-making are
   valuable. These ideas are shared by systems thinking, which has long
   been foundational in agroecology and recognized as a valuable tool for
   dealing with agricultural complexity. The transmission of such skills is
   thus important to understand. Here, twenty-five Canadian and American
   adaptive grazing trainers were interviewed to learn more about how they
   teach such systems thinking, and how they reflect upon their trainees as
   learners and potential adopters. Every trainer considered
   decision-making to be a major component of their lessons. That training
   was described as tackling both the paradigm levelchanging the way
   participants see the world, themselves or their farmand the
   concept/skill level. Paradigm shifts were perceived as the biggest
   challenge for participants. Trainers had difficulty estimating adoption
   rates because there was little consensus on what constituted an
   HM-practitioner: to what level must one adopt the practices? We conclude
   that: (1) trainers' emphasis on paradigms and decision-making confirms
   that HM is systems thinking in practice; (2) the planning and
   decision-making components of HM are distinct from the grazing methods;
   and (3) HM is a fluid and heterogeneous concept that is difficult to
   define and evaluate.},

   systems-Lessons from an agent-based model},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {40},
Number = {B, SI},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In many dryland regions, traditional pastoral land use strategies are
   exposed to various drivers such as demographic or socio-economic change.
   This may lead to an adjustment of livelihood strategies and behavior of
   pastoral households, involving a change in attitudes toward livestock,
   pasture condition and social norms. We use an agent-based model to
   examine long-term social-ecological consequences and implications for
   system resilience of such behavioral changes (e.g., giving up a social
   norm). The model captures feedback between pastures, livestock and
   household livelihood in a common property grazing system. We
   systematically compare three stylized household behavioral types
   (traditional, maximizer and satisficer) that differ in their preferences
   for livestock, their compliance with social norms on pasture resting and
   how they are influenced by the behavior of others. Simulation results
   show that the traditional, norm-abiding household type maintains the
   pasture condition, provided that overall household numbers do not exceed
   a critical threshold. In contrast, a switch to a maximizer type that
   ignores norms may lead to long-term pasture degradation and livestock
   loss, pushing the system to an undesirable state. A change toward a new
   satisficing household type that constrains its herd size while
   diversifying its income sources can lead to improved pasture conditions
   and higher total livestock numbers, even with increased household
   numbers. We conclude that changes in household behavior have strong
   implications for long-term social-ecological system dynamics and have to
   be considered to assess the resilience of pastoral common property
   systems.},

Abstract = {The assessment of grassland grazing strategies and institutional
   arrangements is essential for ensuring the sustainable development of
   grassland grazing systems. By employing per-pixel grazing information
   derived from remote sensing data, this paper presents an agent-based
   model of grassland grazing (ABMGG) for Zeku, China that was designed as
   a framework for assessing the effects of different combinations of
   grazing strategies and institutional arrangements on grassland status.
   By calibrating the parameter values of the ABMGG to the system status
   values under a policy that has already been implemented, the ABMGG can
   help us to understand grassland degradation in response to management
   interventions for each patch of land. In the Zeku implementation, it was
   found that although different grazing policy scenarios could not
   significantly improve or decrease the overall grassland leaf area index,
   a rotational group grazing scenario with a land market tenure system did
   produce a smaller number of severely degraded grass patches than other
   policy scenarios (except regional continuous grazing). This provides a
   new perspective on the consequences of grassland management practices
   where past research has concentrated more on overall grassland
   productivity. The ABMGG can extend the ability of policy assessment
   tools to a high resolution level with pixel-specific real-time remote
   sensing data, making the assessment results more accurate and
   representative.},

Title = {Understanding producers' perspectives on rotational grazing benefits

Volume = {37},

Pages = {24-35},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Experimental findings on rotational grazing (RG) trials have generally
   differed from producer observations of RG outcomes on commercial scale
   ranches. Factors such as small plot size, short duration trials and
   relatively rigid grazing management that lacks responsiveness to the
   dynamic and complex social-ecological systems in grazing trials could
   all contribute to this disparity in outcomes. These differences call for
   a better understanding of producer perceptions of RG benefits. To fill
   this knowledge gap, we surveyed 4500 producers from the Northern and
   Southern Great Plains of the USA. Among the 875 respondents, 40.5\%
   reported that they used continuous grazing (CG), 52.7\% implemented RG
   management in an extensive manner, while 6.8\% adopted management
   intensive grazing. Compared with CG users, adopters of RG in its
   extensive and intensive form reported an average annual increase of
   grazing season by 7.6 and 39.3 days, respectively. When controlling for
   producer demographics, ranch management goals and other rancher
   characteristics, we found soil and climate heterogeneity significantly
   affected the perceived relative benefits of RG vs CG strategies.
   Therefore, instead of focusing on whether RG outperforms CG per se,
   future research could focus on comparison of RG benefits under different
   management intensity levels and identifying soil and climate conditions
   where RG benefits are more noticeable.},

Abstract = {The goal of this paper is to explain why and how increasing
   commoditization and incorporation in the market economy are only now
   leading to a critical transition from pastoralism to ranching in Central
   Africa. While there are similarities between pastoralism and
   capitalism-in both systems, entrepreneurs are strategically maximizing
   their ``stock{''}-there are also differences. We argue that these
   differences can be understood as two distinct types of logic that are
   embedded within larger sociocultural systems: cattle logic and capital
   logic. Understanding how these logics operate within different systems
   is critical for explaining the current shift from pastoralism to
   ranching in Central Africa. We outline a theoretical model that
   integrates concepts from practice theory and the literature on critical
   transitions in social-ecological systems to explain the shift. We
   illustrate the theoretical model using a case comparison of three
   different livestock husbandry systems: Wodaax253;e pastoralists in
   southeastern Niger, peri-urban Fulani pastoralists in the Far North
   Region of Cameroon, and Fulani ranchers in the Adamawa Region of
   Cameroon. We then use these cases to explain the persistence of cattle
   logic among the Wodaax253;e in Niger, as well as the shift from cattle
   logic to capital logic among Fulani in Cameroon. Studying the transition
   from pastoralism to ranching is important because it has major
   implications, including increasing economic inequality, weaker community
   relations, and potential degradation of grazing lands, for livestock
   husbandry systems in Central Africa.},

Journal = {ANTHROPOCENE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {46-69},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We review evidence of Holocene climate, vegetation, and cultural changes
   in Mongolia and critically examine evidence that Mongolia's steppes are
   at the brink of ecological and cultural tipping points in the
   Anthropocene. Until 5,000 YBP there is no evidence of lasting human
   influences on ecosystems, but after this time, changes in vegetation and
   soil physical properties signal domestic livestock grazing impacts on
   steppe ecosystems.
   Contemporary (1991-2015) literature and region by region analysis of
   climate, livestock, remotesensing and human population data reveal two
   potential tipping points. Temperatures warmed across the 5 regions.
   Since 1991, livestock densities and forage use increased in most
   regions, the spatial distribution of grazing pressure is more
   heterogeneous, and variability increased in stocking densities, forage
   use and forage production in all or most regions. Substantial plant
   species shifts and losses occurred in the mountain and forest steppe
   regions. Although a large proportion of Mongolia's rangelands are
   altered from their ecological potential, few have crossed an
   irreversible threshold of ecological change. Rangelands in Mongolia's
   Khangai, northern and central regions may be approaching an ecological
   tipping point if grazing pressure is not reduced. After 1991, herder
   populations initially rose and then decreased significantly across most
   regions. If demographic and social trends contribute to loss of herding
   knowledge and identity, a cultural tipping point could occur. We
   describe four potential future scenarios that could unfold if these
   tipping points are reached, hypothesize feedbacks between ecological and
   cultural thresholds, and discuss implications for policy and management.

Title = {Drivers and constraints of land use transitions on Western grasslands:

Abstract = {Context Land use change drives a host of sustainability challenges on
   Earth's grasslands. To understand the relationship between changing land
   use patterns, human well-being, and ecosystem services, research is
   needed into land use transitions on privately-owned grasslands. Such
   inquiry lies at the intersection of land system science, landscape
   sustainability science and environmental governance. Objectives This
   study investigated land use change in a mountain ranching community in
   the Sierra Nevada, California. The research objective was to highlight
   factors influencing land use transitions and corollary ecological
   outcomes on privately-owned grasslands in the Western US. Methods This
   mixed methods case study integrated participant observation, 30
   semi-structured interviews, and analysis of land cover and real estate
   data. Interviews were conducted with ranchers, public agencies, and
   conservation and real estate industry representatives, and analyzed with
   the constant comparison method using NVivo 12. Results Land use
   transitions in the case study region include agricultural
   intensification, residential and solar development, and
   disintensification. These transitions were influenced by many factors
   including decreasing land access and water availability, amenity
   migration, intergenerational succession, and conservation policy.
   Conclusions By highlighting factors influencing land use transitions on
   working lands, this study can be applied to improve the uptake of
   environmental policies. For the future, several approaches may support
   grasslands conservation: ensuring grazing lands access, income
   diversification, groundwater regulations, agriculture-compatible
   conservation easements, and land use policies supporting ownership
   transition to amenity purposes rather than low-density residential
   development.},

Volume = {77},

Abstract = {Adaptive management of natural resources explicitly incorporates
   learning into a process of science-based decision making. First proposed
   in the late 1970s, over time, adaptive management has become an
   increasingly common approach to management of complex social-ecological
   systems characterized by high uncertainty and conflict. Rangelands used
   for livestock production are one such system. Management outcomes of any
   given livestock operation are a unique combination of the local ecology
   found in a particular place, the management goals and approach of the
   operator and regulators, and regulatory requirements. Scholars have
   hypothesized that adaptive management can reduce conflict by allowing
   experimentation and increased management flexibility when there are
   competing viewpoints. We used a change to adaptive management for
   grazing allotment administration implemented by the US Forest Service in
   Arizona and New Mexico to evaluate this research question. We
   interviewed ranchers and Forest Service employees in Arizona and New
   Mexico to understand how they define adaptive management, what changes
   they experienced due to the shift to adaptive management, and their
   perceptions of the impacts of adaptive management. A decade after its
   implementation, our data show that adaptive management alone does not
   reduce conflict but can help reduce conflict where trust between
   permittees and the US Forest Service is strong. Where trust is lacking,
   adaptive management may strengthen existing patterns of conflict. These
   findings have important management implications for the use of adaptive
   management in the administration of public lands and as a conflict
   management tool. (C) 2021 The Society for Range Management. Published by

Title = {Driving factors behind subjective resilience on organic dairy sheep
   farms},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Organic sheep milk production under a protected designation of origin
   for Roquefort cheese in Aveyron, France, has developed over the past
   several years. This niche market provides farmers with a favorable
   economic context due to high and stable milk prices. However, a variety
   of risks threatens this favorable context. This raises questions about
   driving factors behind resilience of organic dairy sheep farms. Unlike
   previous studies, we assessed the subjective resilience of farms from
   the perspective of farmers. We assumed that the maintenance or
   improvement of farmers' satisfaction over time, despite a variety of
   disturbances, demonstrates the ability of farms to maintain their
   productive functions without undermining natural resources, while
   ensuring fair income and good working conditions. Based on analytical
   frameworks from research on livestock farming systems and
   social-ecological resilience, we aimed to understand the combined
   evolution of farm structure, farming practices, and farmers'
   satisfaction to identify the driving factors behind subjective
   resilience on organic dairy sheep farms. We observed a general trend for
   an increase in farm size. We also used sparse partial least squares
   analysis to relate changes in farmer satisfaction to changes in farm
   structure and farming practices. On the 36 organic dairy sheep farms
   studied, increasing ewe productivity was the main driving factor
   improving subjective farm resilience in a context of high milk prices.
   An increase in ewe productivity was often associated with high rates of
   feed concentrate distribution and a sharp decrease in grazing duration
   on a few farms. The change in farming practices resulting from this
   productivity paradigm highlighted a trend toward the conventionalization
   of organic sheep milk production. Underlying principles of this
   conventionalization were sometimes at odds with resilience factors of
   social-ecological systems reported in the literature. This calls for
   caution when using farmers' satisfaction as a proxy of farm resilience
   and suggests combining subjective assessment with more objective
   approaches.},

Title = {Impacts of livestock grazing on the probability of burning in wildfires
   vary by region and vegetation type in California},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Wildfire activity has recently increased in California, impacting
   ecosystems and human well-being. California's rangelands are complex
   social-ecological systems composed of multiple ecosystems and the people
   who live and work in them. Livestock grazing has been proposed as a tool
   for reducing wildfire activity. Here, we explore how grazing affects
   wildfire at large spatial scales, assessing burn probability on
   rangelands with different grazing levels. We collected grazing data by
   surveying 140 large private landowners in three social-ecological
   regions: California's North Bay, Central Coast, and Central Valley and
   Foothills. Using pre-regression matching and mixed effects regression,
   we calculate the burn probability from 2001 to 2017 in points sampled
   from grazed and ungrazed properties in each region in grasslands,
   shrub/scrublands, and forests. We find that in the Central Coast and
   North Bay, annual burn probability decreases as stocking levels increase
   across all vegetation types, with reductions of 0.008-0.036. In the
   Central Valley and Foothills, the relationship is complex, with burn
   probability increasing over some grazing levels and variations in the
   effect of higher stocking densities. Our results indicate that livestock
   grazing may reduce annual burn probability in some regions and
   ecosystems in California, providing the first large-scale assessment of
   this relationship.},

Abstract = {Faced with environmental degradation, governments worldwide are
   developing policies to safeguard ecosystem services (ES). Many ES models
   exist to support these policies, but they are generally poorly
   validated, especially at large scales, which undermines their
   credibility. To address this gap, we describe a study of multiple models
   of five ES, which we validate at an unprecedented scale against 1675
   data points across sub-Saharan Africa. We find that potential ES
   (biophysical supply of carbon and water) are reasonably well predicted
   by the existing models. These potential ES models can also be used as
   inputs to new models for realised ES (use of charcoal, firewood, grazing
   resources and water), by adding information on human population density.
   We find that increasing model complexity can improve estimates of both
   potential and realised ES, suggesting that developing more detailed
   models of ES will be beneficial. Furthermore, in 85\% of cases, human
   population density alone was as good or a better predictor of realised
   ES than ES models, suggesting that it is demand, rather than supply that
   is predominantly determining current patterns of ES use. Our study
   demonstrates the feasibility of ES model validation, even in
   data-deficient locations such as sub-Saharan Africa. Our work also shows
   the clear need for more work on the demand side of ES models, and the
   importance of model validation in providing a stronger base to support
   policies which seek to achieve sustainable development in support of
   human well-being.},

Title = {A Framework to Tackling the Synchrony between Social and Ecological
   Phases of the Annual Cyclic Movement of Transhumant Pastoralism},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Transhumant pastoralism is mobile livelihood strategy in which families
   and their herds move seasonally from lowlands, where they settle during
   the winter, towards the highlands, located in mountainous areas, during
   the summer. We propose a framework, rooted in a socio-environmental
   coevolutionary perspective, for the transhumant annual cycle as
   comprised by the winter-phase, the summer-phase, and movement
   transitions between them. The aim was to assess the level of synchrony
   between ecological phases and social phases and the benefit of moving
   between pasturelands in selected study cases from Patagonia, Argentina.
   Ecological phases were addressed by the difference between vegetation
   productivity of winter- and summer-lands, with Fourier transform applied
   to data series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).
   Social phases were estimated by the proportion of annual time spent by
   pastoralists and their herds in each site and during transitions,
   respectively, obtained from interviews. The framework was sensitive to
   capturing differences across study cases. There was an observed tendency
   towards more synchronisation in the cases with closer distances and
   asynchrony in the cases with longer distances and longer movement
   transitions between pasturelands. Results are encouraging as a step
   towards the development of a monitoring system of both transhumant
   pastoralism activity and environmental changes.},

Title = {Disentangling the role of management practices on ecosystem services
   delivery in Mediterranean silvopastoral systems: Synergies and
   trade-offs through expert-based assessment},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {517},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Silvopastoral systems (SPS) emerge with a renewal interest in the
   Mediterranean for their promotion of multifunctionality through a
   variety of ecosystem services (ES). However, the understanding of how
   combined forestry and pastoral practices affect the ES delivery as well
   as the synergies and trade-off dynamics amongst them is still very
   limited. We applied the structured expert consultation Delphi method to
   assess the medium-term effect of relevant silvopastoral management
   practices (SMP) on the delivery of provision, regulation and maintenance
   and cultural ES in Mediterranean mid-mountain SPS in Spain. The
   deliberation process entailed two rounds and the Delphi panel was
   finally formed by 69 experts covering a broad spectrum of background and
   expertise. Results show that some practices, such as silvicultural
   treatments (e.g., thinning or coppice selection), play a multifunctional
   role contributing to ES delivery in bundles while some trade-offs are
   also identified between SMP, such as free animal grazing, and the
   provision of some ES. Synergies are also found between ES, such as
   livestock production and recreational hunting and between timber
   production and carbon sequestration, whereas possible trade-offs were
   particularly relevant between wildfire prevention and carbon
   sequestration. These findings can support decision-making processes
   towards sustainable and multifunctional silvopastoral management in the
   northern Mediterranean basin.},

Abstract = {Long-term livestock grazing has shaped landscapes, biodiversity,
   societies, cultures, and economies in the North Atlantic over time.
   However, overgrazing has become a major environmental sustainability
   challenge for this region, covering the Faroe Islands, Greenland,
   Iceland, Norway, and Scotland. The objective of this study was to elicit
   narratives and spatial patterns of local people's management preferences
   for sheep grazing in the Faroe Islands through a socio-cultural lens. We
   collected data via a Public Participation Geographic Information Systems
   (PPGIS) survey with an open question about hopes and concerns for sheep
   management in the Faroe Islands and a mapping exercise for expressing
   spatial preferences for sheep management. Four distinct narratives
   emerged from a qualitative analysis of responses to the open question (n
   = 184): (1) Sustainable sheep management, (2) Nature without sheep, (3)
   Sheep as part of Faroese culture, and (4) Sheep as nuisance. Visual
   inspection of narrative-specific maps with locations where either no or
   fewer sheep were preferred indicated that sheep management is not simply
   a `sheep vs. no sheep' issue but embedded in a more nuanced
   consideration of the place of sheep in the landscape and society. For
   example, for some residents sheep-farming is not a commercial enterprise
   but a social activity and local source of food. Our combined
   methodological approach using qualitative and spatial data can help
   researchers in other fields identify the interplay between
   place-specific areas of grazing management concern and socio-cultural
   values, enabling more targeted land-use management policies or plans.},

Abstract = {Rangelands provide the main forage resource for livestock in many parts
   of the world, but maintaining long-term productivity and providing
   sufficient income for the rancher remains a challenge. One key issue is
   to maintain the rangeland in conditions where the rancher has the
   greatest possibility to adapt his/her management choices to a highly
   fluctuating and uncertain environment. In this study, we address
   management robustness and adaptability, which increase the resilience of
   a rangeland. After reviewing how the concept of resilience evolved in
   parallel to modelling views on rangelands, we present a dynamic model of
   rangelands to which we applied the mathematical framework of viability
   theory to quantify the management adaptability of the system in a
   stochastic environment. This quantification is based on an index that
   combines the robustness of the system to rainfall variability and the
   ability of the rancher to adjust his/her management through time. We
   evaluated the adaptability for four possible scenarios combining two
   rainfall regimes (high or low) with two herding strategies (grazers only
   or mixed herd). Results show that pure grazing is viable only for
   high-rainfall regimes, and that the use of mixed-feeder herds increases
   the adaptability of the management. The management is the most adaptive
   with mixed herds and in rangelands composed of an intermediate density
   of trees and grasses. In such situations, grass provides high quantities
   of biomass and woody plants ensure robustness to droughts. Beyond the
   implications for management, our results illustrate the relevance of
   viability theory for addressing the issue of robustness and adaptability
   in non-equilibrium environments.},

Title = {Climate adaptation, institutional change, and sustainable livelihoods of
   herder communities in northern Tibet},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The Tibetan grassland social-ecological systems are widely held to be
   highly vulnerable to climate change. We aim to investigate livelihood
   adaptation strategies of herder households and the types of local
   institutions that shaped those adaptation strategies. We examined the
   barriers and opportunities for strengthening adaptive capacity of local
   herder communities. We designed and implemented a household survey in
   the herder communities of northern Tibet. The survey results showed that
   migratory grazing has become less feasible. Storage, diversification,
   and market exchange have become the dominant adaptation strategies. The
   adaptation strategies of local herders have been reshaped by local
   institutional change. Local governmental and market institutions played
   the dominant roles in reshaping climate adaptation strategies. Although
   the present livelihood adaption strategies related to sedentary grazing
   have improved productivity and profitability of the herding livelihood,
   they have led to continuous deterioration of pastures. The local grazing
   system has become more and more dependent on artificial feeding and
   inputs from outside the grazing system. Purchasing forage has become one
   of the dominant adaptation strategies of local herder households.
   Multilevel regression modeling of this adaptation behavior showed that
   explanatory variables related to climate variability, household capital,
   and local institutional arrangements had statistically significant
   relationships with the adoption of this adaptation strategy. The results
   implies that building household capital and promoting the coordination
   among local governmental, market, and communal institutions are critical
   for strengthening adaptive capacity of the Tibetan herder communities.},

Title = {Practical considerations for adaptive strategies by US grazing land
   managers with a changing climate},
Journal = {AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {We outline practical considerations for grazing land adaptations with a
   changing climate, with an emphasis on the ranch operation scale and
   specific attention to directional climate changes and increased climate
   variability. These adaptive strategies fall into two themes: flexibility
   and learning under uncertainty. Ranches and livestock operations with
   greater land, social, or other capital resources may have more
   flexibility. Risk can be reduced for managers (ranchers, farmers,
   operators, and livestock managers) through participation in conservation
   or farm policy programs and/or market-based approaches. Bolstering
   adaptive capacity across landscapes and time can originate from social
   capital of operators and strategic collaborations among managers and
   scientists. As climate diverges from historical baselines and the realm
   of managers' experiential knowledge, new conceptual frameworks are
   needed to structure conversations, influence research relevancy and
   impact, and drive imaginative solutions among researchers, managers, and
   local communities for socio-ecological systems. We provide simplified
   frameworks to help guide conversation, future research, and new
   imaginative solutions for systems-scale knowledge needs and adaptation
   to address increasingly uncertain and complex change at multiple scales.
   Practical considerations for adaptive strategies by grazing land
   managers with a changing climate will be accelerated through (1)
   collaborative efforts among managers and explicitly with
   science-management partnerships becoming more mainstream, (2)
   co-produced research with managers and researchers at ranch scales, (3)
   development of communities of practice and associated learning
   opportunities, and (4) continued co-development and advancement of
   technologies and tools that result in high uptake adoption by ranch
   managers.},

Abstract = {Mobile pastoralist strategies have evolved over centuries and are well
   adjusted to the variable climatic conditions of semi-arid regions.
   However, economic, social, and climatic changes, as well as technical
   advancements such as truck transportation, have increasingly affected
   the livelihood of pastoralist households in recent decades. An increase
   in inequality has been observed between wealthy pastoralists with large
   herds and impoverished households that are experiencing decreasing herd
   sizes on the High Plateau in Eastern Morocco, for example. In addition,
   whereas wealthy pastoralists possess the financial means to use trucks
   to transport their herds across large distances, the impoverished
   households are mainly limited to ranges they can travel by foot. This
   phenomenon can be described as polarization: the emergence of two
   distinct socio-economic groups with respect to household livestock and
   monetary resources. The reasons that have led to this polarization,
   however, are not well understood at present. In this study, we present a
   multi-agent simulation model to examine the economic, ecological,
   climatic, and demographic factors driving this polarization. The model
   captures the feedbacks between pastoralist households, their herds, and
   the pastures that they use in a common property grazing system. Using
   this model, we are able to show that heterogeneities in household assets
   (livestock and monetary resources) are only one cause of polarization.
   Changes in ecological conditions and the impact of climate and
   demographic change can also cause polarization, even if households are
   completely homogeneous in their characteristics.},

Abstract = {Agricultural land use has intended and unintended consequences for human
   livelihoods through feedbacks within coupled human and natural systems.
   In Senegal, West Africa, soils are a vital resource for livelihoods and
   food security in smallholder farming communities. In this study, we
   explored the connections among land use, soil conditions, plant nutrient
   content, and the abundance of several locust and grasshopper species. We
   worked in two rural farming villages in the Kaffrine region of Senegal.
   Oedaleus senegalensis was least abundant in groundnut areas where plant
   N was highest and abundance was negatively correlated with plant N
   across land use types. Overall, grasshoppers were most numerous in
   grazing and fallow areas. There was little variation in soil properties
   across land use types and soil organic matter (SOM) and inorganic soil N
   content were low throughout. SOM was positively correlated with soil
   inorganic N concentration, which in turn was positively correlated with
   plant N content. Of the management practices we surveyed, fallowing
   fields was important for soil N and SOM replenishment. These results
   corroborate other research indicating that land use, management
   practices, soil and plant nutrients, and insect herbivore abundance are
   mechanistically coupled. Although further research is needed, improving
   soil fertility could be used as an alternative to pesticides to keep
   locusts at bay and improve crop yields. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Ranchers and pastoralists worldwide manage and depend upon resources
   from rangelands (which support indigenous vegetation with the potential
   for grazing) across Earth's terrestrial surface. In the Great Plains of
   North America rangeland ecology has increasingly recognized the
   importance of managing rangeland vegetation heterogeneity to address
   conservation and production goals. This paradigm, however, has limited
   application for ranchers as they manage extensive beef production
   operations under high levels of social-ecological complexity and
   uncertainty. We draw on the ethics of care theoretical framework to
   explore how ranchers choose management actions. We used modified
   grounded theory analysis of repeated interviews with ranchers to (1)
   compare rancher decision-making under relatively certain and uncertain
   conditions and (2) describe a typology of practices used to prioritize
   and choose management actions that maintain effective stewardship of
   these often multi-generational ranches. We contrast traditional
   decision-making frameworks with those described by interviewees when
   high levels of environmental and market uncertainty or ecological
   complexity led ranchers toward use of care-based, flexible and
   relational frameworks for decision-making. Ranchers facing complexity
   and uncertainty often sought ``middle-ground{''} strategies to balance
   multiple, conflicting responsibilities in rangeland social-ecological
   systems. For example, ranchers' care-based decision-making leads to
   conservative stocking approaches to ``manage for the middle,{''} e.g. to
   limit risk under uncertain weather and forage availability conditions.
   Efforts to promote heterogeneity-based rangeland management for
   biodiversity conservation through the restoration of patch burn grazing
   and prairie dog conservation will require increased valuation of
   ranchers' care work.},

Abstract = {The people who live in Australia's rangelands are vital for maintaining
   natural systems, agricultural production, infrastructure for tourism and
   many services and products which benefit the nation. However, the number
   of people living within many rangeland regions is declining, services
   are being withdrawn and resilience undermined. Social capital is an
   important concept within the resilience literature. Bonding social
   capital is based strong ties within relatively homogenous local groups,
   bridging social capital is based on ties between more diverse local
   groups and linking social capital is based on ties between local and
   external groups. Within the rangelands, there are often strong bonding
   and bridging social capitals based on internal social and formal
   connections, but gaps in linking social capital due to weak or
   imbalanced connections with external groups and organisations. There is
   evidence that all three social capitals are needed for regional
   resilience, and the gap in linking is thus a key issue. People who live
   outside the rangelands can help rebuild this resilience by linking their
   skills, knowledge and expertise with local groups and communities. Many
   city-based scientists, policy makers, influencers and other
   professionals work in and have empathy for the rangelands. By connecting
   meaningfully with local groups such as Landcare, service clubs,
   philanthropic groups or Indigenous Rangers, they would find many
   benefits to their own endeavours through improved policies, knowledge
   and service delivery. Central-western Queensland is provided as an
   example where many such mutual benefits and networks already exist,
   offering pathways for linking local residents with external experts.
   Current platforms offer opportunities for a greater range of external
   academic institutions and organisations to engage with locals, with
   everyone standing to gain.},

Abstract = {Understanding the perception of environmental resources by the users is
   an important element in planning its sustainable use and management.
   Pastoralist communities manage their vast grazing territories and
   exploit resource variability through strategic mobility. However, the
   knowledge on which pastoralists' resource management is based and their
   perception of the grazing areas has received limited attention. To
   improve this understanding and to document this knowledge in a way that
   can be communicated with `outsiders', we adopted a participatory mapping
   approach using satellite imagery to explore how Borana pastoralists of
   southern Ethiopia differentiated and characterized their grazing areas.
   The Borana herders conceptualized their grazing areas as set of
   distinctive grazing units each having specific names and
   characteristics. The precise location and the borders of each grazing
   unit were identified on the satellite image. In naming of the grazing
   units, the main differentiating criteria were landforms, vegetation
   types, prevalence of wildlife species, and manmade features. Based on
   the dominant soil type, the grazing units were aggregated into seasonal
   grazing areas that were described using factors such as soil drainage
   properties, extent of woody cover, main grass species, and prevalence of
   ecto-parasites. Pastoralists ranking of the seasonal grazing areas
   according to their suitability for cattle grazing matched with
   vegetation assessment results on the abundance of desirable fodder
   varieties. Approaching grazing area differentiation from the
   pastoralists' perspectives improves the understanding of rangeland
   characteristics that pastoralists considered important in their grazing
   management and visualization of their mental representation in digital
   maps eases communication of this knowledge.},

Title = {Pathways to coexistence with dingoes across Australian farming
   landscapes},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN CONSERVATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {4},
Month = {MAR 8},
Abstract = {IntroductionAgriculture and biodiversity conservation are both vitally
   important human activities that overlap geographically and are often in
   conflict. Animal agriculture has been implicated in species loss and the
   degradation of ecosystems due to land clearing, overgrazing, and
   conflicts with large carnivores such as dingoes (Canis dingo). This
   paper explores the potential for transformation in Australian commercial
   livestock production from human-dingo conflict towards social-ecological
   coexistence. MethodA qualitative model that depicts transformative
   change was developed from field observations and twenty-one in-depth
   interviews with livestock producers, conservation researchers, grazing
   industry representatives and policy makers across Australia. The model
   articulates the current state of dingo management and the drivers of
   system change. ResultsSeven pathways are described to catalyse
   transformation from routine lethal management of dingoes towards a
   future vision that embeds mutually beneficial coexistence. Central to
   transformation is the adoption by livestock producers of preventive
   non-lethal innovations supported by a new farming movement, Predator
   Smart Farming, that balances livestock grazing and wildlife conservation
   values to unlock the resilience of landscapes, animals (domesticated and
   wild) and livelihoods. Other key pathways include targeted research,
   capacity building, outreach and knowledge sharing networks;
   institutional (policy, legislation, and economic incentives) and
   cultural change; public awareness raising and advocacy to reduce lethal
   control; and greater involvement of Indigenous Australians in decisions
   relating to wildlife management. DiscussionThe seven transition pathways
   are discussed in relation to how they can collectively foster
   coexistence with dingoes in extensive rangelands grazing systems.
   International examples of interventions are used to illustrate the types
   of successful actions associated with each pathway that could inform
   action in Australia. The findings have implications for coexistence with
   large carnivores in rangeland ecosystems globally.},

Title = {Well-being and conservation: diversity and change in visions of a good
   life among the Maasai of northern Tanzania},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The Simanjiro plains, east of Tarangire National Park in Northern
   Tanzania are a key dispersal area for wildlife, and are of vital
   importance to Maasai pastoral livelihoods, which are rapidly
   diversifying. Diversification is coupled with fragmentation of the
   rangelands as agriculture expands and multiple actors compete for land.
   These changes reflect transformations occurring across pastoral
   rangelands, and pose the broader challenge of reconciling conservation
   and development objectives. We propose that qualitative research using a
   three-dimensional human well-being framework, encompassing material,
   relational, and subjective aspects, can inform locally legitimate and
   socially just conservation. Through semistructured group interviews
   across four villages, we explore well-being conceptions of Maasai men
   and women in Simanjiro. In particular we focus on the value of
   understanding social complexity for conservation research in the form of
   (i) the heterogeneity of conceptions of well-being across gender, age
   groups, and villages; (ii) temporal dynamics in notions and experiences.
   Material assets, namely land (for grazing and agriculture) and livestock
   are important to people but are intertwined with other aspects of
   well-being. Subjective well-being is centered on concerns about future
   security, especially with regards to land. Autonomy and social unity
   (relational dimension) are key priorities. We reflect on the
   implications for conservation at the study site, and more broadly on how
   well-being can better be incorporated into policy and practice that
   takes social justice seriously. The diversity we find in well-being
   priorities and experiences shows the importance of taking a
   disaggregated approach that conceptualizes benefits and burdens across a
   range of locally important well-being components ensuring the priorities
   of the most marginalized groups are represented.},

Abstract = {Livestock grazing in drylands supports pastoral livelihoods but is
   facing multiple changes including shocks such as severe droughts.
   Herdsmen specifically cite drought events as a reason for the
   abandonment of their transhumance practices. The purpose of this study
   is to assess the relevance of drought as a driving force for losses of
   livelihood security leading to a specific systemic change households
   abandoning transhumant pastoralism.
   We present and apply a framework for systematic analyses of the social
   ecological functioning of pastoral resource use that consists of the
   following components: (1) A spatially-explicit social ecological model
   for analyzing the system dynamics, especially in face of severe drought
   in connection with other driving forces of variability, (2) an
   operationalized measure for assessing livelihood security, and (3) a
   strategy for systematic vulnerability assessments of pastoral households
   by scenario comparison. This approach is applied to the land use system
   of the transhumant pastoralists in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco.
   The results indicate that drought is the main threat to livelihood
   security in only a few cases, eventually forcing households to abandon
   their transhumant lifestyle. Instead, other (endogenous and exogenous)
   sources of variability were found to be the main driving force for
   vulnerability, depending on the household characteristics such as income
   needs and the level of pastoral mobility. We discuss implications on the
   role of severe drought in connection with other processes of global
   change such as social change and land use change for livelihood security
   in pastoral systems.
   Moreover, on the basis of these findings, we discuss how the relevance
   of shocks as a driving force of systemic changes in coupled
   human-nature-systems may be adequately explored. These conclusions
   concern the interplay of exogenous and endogenous factors, and
   unintended side-effects of intended changes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Origin, Persistence, and Resolution of the Rotational Grazing Debate:
   Integrating Human Dimensions Into Rangeland Research},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {64},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The debate regarding the benefits of rotational grazing has eluded
   resolution within the US rangeland profession for more than 60 yr. This
   forum examines the origin of the debate and the major reasons for its
   persistence in an attempt to identify common ground for resolution, and
   to search for meaningful lessons from this central chapter in the
   history of the US rangeland profession. Rotational grazing was a
   component of the institutional and scientific response to severe
   rangeland degradation at the turn of the 20th century, and it has since
   become the professional norm for grazing management. Managers have found
   that rotational grazing systems can work for diverse management
   purposes, but scientific experiments have demonstrated that they do not
   necessarily work for specific ecological purposes. These interpretations
   appear contradictory, but we contend that they can be reconciled by
   evaluation within the context of complex adaptive systems in which human
   variables such as goal setting, experiential knowledge, and decision
   making are given equal importance to biophysical variables. The
   scientific evidence refuting the ecological benefits of rotational
   grazing is robust, but also narrowly focused, because it derives from
   experiments that intentionally excluded these human variables.
   Consequently, the profession has attempted to answer a broad, complex
   question-whether or not managers should adopt rotational grazing-with
   necessarily narrow experimental research focused exclusively on
   ecological processes. The rotational grazing debate persists because the
   rangeland profession has not yet developed a management and research
   framework capable of incorporating both the social and biophysical
   components of complex adaptive systems. We recommend moving beyond the
   debate over whether or not rotational grazing works by focusing on
   adaptive management and the integration of experiential and
   experimental, as well as social and biophysical, knowledge to provide a
   more comprehensive framework for the management of rangeland systems.},

Abstract = {The Shoesole Management Team (Shoesole) and the Stewardship Alliance of
   Northeast Elko (SANE) are place-based, landowner-organized, natural and
   human resource conservation initiatives. The Shoesole was organized in
   2002 to implement a more holistic approach to rangeland management on 2
   federal livestock grazing allotments. This effort provided the
   foundation for SANE, which was organized in 2012 by representatives of 8
   ranches in northeastern Nevada in response to the potential listing of
   the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse). The
   SANE and Shoesole encompass >688,000 ha in northeastern Nevada, of which
   200,000 ha is privately owned and 488,000 ha is comprised of public land
   allotments managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S.
   Forest Service (USFS). Over 50\% of the sagebrush (Artemisia spp.)
   habitat in the SANE area was designated a Sagebrush Focal Area in the
   BLM Resource Plan and USFS Land Use Plan sage-grouse amendments. The
   SANE includes state and federal land management and resource agencies
   with regulatory and management authority in the region. The SANE group
   tackled the planning and implementation of sound conservation management
   through the development of a Sagebrush Ecosystem Conservation Plan. The
   SANE and Shoesole came together voluntarily, as rancher-organized
   grassroots initiatives, with a common goal of creating a better
   place-based conservation decision-making process. They addressed the
   human dimension aspects of range management, and challenges, to include
   sage-grouse habitat issues through a facilitated collaborative model
   that incorporated the building of trusting relationships as the
   foundation of solution, and place-based resource management strategies
   as a method to increase transparency and reduce conflict through civil
   dialogue.},

Title = {Transition from subsistence grazing to nature-based recreation: A
   nuanced view of land abandonment in a mountain social-ecological system,
   southwestern Cape, South Africa},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {105},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Over the last 50 years, studies have shown a decline in the use of
   mountain lands, a phenomenon termed land abandonment. We investigate the
   causal mechanisms of land use change in a mountain catchment important
   for regional water supplies in the southwestern Cape of South Africa.
   Uniquely, we include nature-based recreational land use types typically
   excluded from land abandonment studies. We repeated a structured
   questionnaire originally conducted with landowners 38 years previously
   and analysed orthoimages from 1948, 1972 and 2014. To identify and
   contextualise causal mechanisms of change we used thematic analysis and
   generated narratives from in-depth interviews with landowners. The land
   use system in 1948 and 1972 was dominated by livestock based,
   subsistence agriculture and small-scale farming. This transitioned to
   agricultural intensification on the lowlands and small portions of the
   mountains and the utilisation of mountains for non-economic nature-based
   recreation and ecotourism. The use of frequent small, low
   intensity-controlled fires was prevalent in the past. More recently,
   fires have been actively suppressed resulting in the build-up of biomass
   and the development of infrequent, extensive, high-intensity wildfires.
   Land use change in the mountains was driven primarily by socioeconomic
   drivers, including socio-economic benefits related to globalisation and
   economic growth, and not by concerns over land degradation or resource
   depletion. Our findings support evidence that shows that people?s
   responses to economic opportunities drive local determinants of land use
   change and highlights the importance of perceptions in driving land use
   transitions. We show that existing models of land abandonment are likely
   overly deterministic in that they do not consider social and cultural
   factors that may cause a landowner to continue using their land for
   semi-economic or non-economic reasons. While there is merit in
   large-scale remote sensing studies, we emphasise the importance of using
   mixed remote sensing and social science methods for informing models of
   land use change.},

Title = {``A shepherd has to invent{''}: Poetic analysis of social-ecological
   change in the cultural landscape of the central Spanish Pyrenees},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {20},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Since the mid-20th century, the Pyrenean pastoral social-ecological
   system (SES) has undergone socioeconomic and demographic transformations
   leading to changes in grazing practices and a decline in the livestock
   industry. Land abandonment has contributed to an ecological transition
   from herbaceous vegetation cover to shrublands and forests, leading to a
   loss of ecosystem services, including biodiversity and forage. I
   interviewed 27 stockmen (ganaderos) in two valleys of the central
   Pyrenees to document their traditional ecological knowledge and
   observations of environmental, social, economic, and cultural changes in
   the valleys. I used poetic analysis, a qualitative data analysis
   approach, to illustrate and analyze one ganadero's experience of
   social-ecological change. First, I created seven poems based on an
   interview transcript with this ganadero. Second, I analyzed the poetry I
   created, to see what new insights and understanding about system
   dynamics and the lived experience of SES change emerged from analysis of
   the transcript re-presented as poetry. Third, I compared key themes that
   emerged from this analysis with findings across the other 26 interviews.
   Fourth, I read the poems and presented the associated analysis to
   multiple audiences, to gauge their impact and effectiveness in
   communicating research findings. Finally, I synthesized across the
   themes raised in the seven poems. Poetic analysis revealed emotional and
   cultural dimensions of change, especially the importance of occupational
   and place identity, in the experience of the ganadero. The transcript
   re-presented as poetry portrayed the ganadero as an agent in creating
   and maintaining a cultural landscape and as both an adaptor and resister
   to SES change. Poetic analysis also uncovered telling contradictions,
   adaptive capacities, and barriers to adaptation in this SES that went
   unappreciated with conventional qualitative analysis approaches. This
   exploratory study illustrates the potential of poetry as a method of
   data analysis and communication in SES research.},

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {474},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Increasing livestock densities on limited grazing areas in African
   savannahs lead to resource degradation through overgrazing, aggravated
   by drought. Assessing herd management strategies over longer periods at
   landscape scale is important to propose options for sustainable land
   use. This requires an understanding of processes related to hydrology,
   nutrient cycling, herd movement, pasture degradation, and animal
   resilience that involve dynamic soil-plant-animal interactions and human
   decisions about stocking rates, livestock purchases and sales.We present
   the coupled model system MPMAS-LUCIA-LIVSIM (MLL), the combination of a
   spatially explicit agent-based model for human decision-making (MPMAS),
   a spatially distributed landscape model for water flows, nutrient cycles
   and plant growth (LUCIA), and a herd model (LIVSIM) representing
   grazing, body weight, nutrition and excreta of individual animals. MLL
   represents daily vegetation growth in response to grazing and organic
   inputs, monthly animal performance influenced by forage availability and
   quality, and herders' man-agement in response to resource status. New
   modules for selective grazing, resprouting of pasture, herd move-ment
   and model coupling were developed for MLL.The test case of a pastoral
   system in the Ethiopian Borana region demonstrates the capabilities of
   MLL to simulate key soil-plant-animal-human interactions under
   climate-related management scenarios with varying access to grazing
   land, changing cattle prices and different spending / saving behaviour
   of herders. 20-year simulations showed the negative impact of
   consecutive drought years on vegetation biomass, on herd devel-opment
   and movement and how reserving grazing areas for dry seasons could
   mitigate overgrazing and improve income. Seasonality and drought
   response of vegetation growth, selective grazing of different plant
   parts, resprouting after grazing, calving intervals, milk yields and
   lactation in response to forage supply and quality as well as herder
   reactions to shocks were plausibly represented.Building upon this
   successful proof-of-concept, MLL can be used to identify robust
   management options for improved grazing systems in savannahs in
   follow-up research.},

Title = {Lessons learned from farmers' experience of soil carbon management
   practices in grazing regimes of Australia},
Journal = {AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {43},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Previous research on increasing soil carbon sequestration, through soil
   carbon management (SCM), has not integrated social components into the
   ecological system. To understand how experienced farmers combine social
   and ecological components of soil carbon management practices, we have
   used a social-ecological systems (SES) framework. This study examines
   the distribution and pattern of farmers' SCM practices, comparing and
   contrasting two farming cohorts based on inherent soil fertility in a
   rotational grazing regime of sub-tropical temperate grazing lands in
   Australia. Twenty-five grazing farmers with the land of low (n= 13) and
   moderate (n=12) fertility soils were interviewed about SCM and how they
   have maintained their grazing regime despite climatic constraints using
   the SES framework. Both farming cohorts (low-fertility farms and
   moderate-fertility farms) have shown resolve to continue their grazing
   regime because the benefits were manifold and affected the whole-farm
   sustainability. Farmers with low-fertility farms highlighted a number of
   SCM outcomes but were less confident of achieving them. Farmers were
   focused on the agri-environmental benefits of SCM practices in a
   holistic manner, rather than a single goal of increasing soil carbon.
   The interviewed farmers reported a number of benefits that accrue from
   their grazing regimes, including improvements in production, soil
   moisture retention, and soil health, even though some of these benefits
   were not measured. Farmers in more ``stressed `` environments, with low
   soil fertility, also emphasized mental health and landscape esthetics as
   outcomes of SCM. These features of the farmers' SCM provide important
   benefits that are not easily quantified but are also instrumental in
   encouraging other farmers to manage their soil. Long-term practitioners
   of rotational grazing such as the farmers in this study can provide
   useful insights for a more targeted, customized, and nuanced government
   policy that focuses on whole-farm sustainability, which can also improve
   soil carbon stocks in similar regions of Australia.},

Title = {Informal Rangeland Monitoring and Its Importance to Conservation in a US
   Ranching Community},
Journal = {RANGELAND ECOLOGY \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {Effective natural resource management relies on accurate and timely
   information on the natural environment, which may be obtained by formal
   ({''}scientific{''}) or informal ({''}local{''} or ``traditional{''})
   methods. Formal monitoring methods are well documented and widely
   accepted among the rangeland science community, yet adoption by U.S.
   ranchers is inconsistent. In contrast, informal monitoring appears to be
   widely used by ranchers, but its practice and importance have rarely
   been documented or assessed. By interviewing ranchers and government
   agency personnel, we evaluated informal monitoring in and around the
   Altar Valley, Arizona, United States. Informal monitoring techniques
   included qualitative visual appraisals of forage quantity, indicator
   species and erosion, and incorporated local environmental history. The
   environmental knowledge embedded in informal monitoring was generally
   compatible with natural science. Informal monitoring was conducted
   continuously throughout the year and provided near real-time assessments
   that integrated observations of most land in individual pastures and
   ranches. In contrast, formal monitoring was generally performed only
   once per year, in a limited number of areas and with a delay of a few
   months between observation and completion of analysis. Thus informal
   monitoring had higher spatial coverage and temporal resolution and
   provided assessments faster than formal monitoring. Consequently,
   ranchers generally considered informal monitoring to be more relevant
   than formal monitoring to formulating yearly grazing plans and
   responding rapidly to unpredictable changes in the natural environment.
   Ranchers incorporated informal monitoring into assessments of rangeland
   trends and outcomes of conservation measures and thereby into choices of
   grazing system and planning of brush management and erosion control.
   Thus informal monitoring was foundational to long-term conservation,
   annual rangeland management planning, and adaptive natural resource
   management on subyearly timescales. If informal monitoring is of
   comparable utility in other rural communities, it would appear
   advantageous to document and evaluate informal approaches and to
   incorporate them into formal conservation planning. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {Pastoral systems are regarded as complex social-ecological systems with
   components that interact and change over a range of spatial and temporal
   scales. As such, herd mobility has traditionally been used to respond to
   the dynamic nature of these systems. However, mobile pastoral systems
   around the world are becoming more constrained and increasingly
   fragmented with important implications for herd mobility. This study
   assessed the spatial distribution of 256 herds and their mobility
   patterns over a decade in the 10 villages that comprise the spatially
   constrained Leliefontein pastoral area in South Africa. We developed a
   hierarchical model of rangeland use, which showed that several
   stratified and connected socioeconomic, climatic, and environmental
   factors determined the spatial and temporal use of grazing areas in this
   192 000-ha semiarid environment. At the highest level of use, access to
   the Leliefontein pastoral area is formally regulated. At the next level,
   the place of residence of herd owners largely defined which village
   commons was used by their livestock. At the third level of rangeland
   use, the wealth status of owners determined where in relation to human
   settlements their herds were located. At the lowest level in the
   hierarchy, the locations of water and croplands delineated seasonal
   grazing areas and the movement of stockposts. These stratified factors,
   together with the overall variability in grazing resource availability
   and the different decision making processes involved, resulted in high
   flexibility and diversity of herd mobility patterns at the lowest level
   of rangeland use. This, in turn, ensured heterogeneity in resource use
   over a range of spatial and temporal scales. It was concluded that
   policies should embrace the complexity of the pastoral system and enable
   the adaptive management of herds. This could reduce the level of
   vulnerability experienced by pastoralists to climate variability and
   wider societal change. (C) 2018 The Society for Range Management.

Abstract = {Experiments investigating grazing systems have often excluded
   ranch-scale decision making, which has limited our understanding of the
   processes and consequences of adaptive management. We conducted
   interviews and vegetation monitoring on 17 ranches in eastern Colorado
   and eastern Wyoming to investigate rancher decision-making processes and
   the associated ecological consequences. Management variables
   investigated were grazing strategy, grazing intensity, planning style,
   and operation type. Ecological attributes included the relative
   abundance of plant functional groups and categories of ground cover. We
   examined the environmental and management correlates of plant species
   and functional group composition using nonmetric multidimensional
   scaling and linear mixed models. After accounting for environmental
   variation across the study region, species composition did not differ
   between grazing management strategy and planning style. Operation type
   was significantly correlated with plant community composition.
   Integrated cow-calf plus yearling operations had greater annual and less
   key perennial cool-season grass species cover relative to cow-calf -
   only operations. Integrated cow-calf plus yearling ranches were able to
   more rapidly restock following drought compared with cow-calf
   operations. Differences in types of livestock operations contributed to
   variability in plant species composition across the landscape that may
   support diverse native faunal species in these rangeland ecosystems.
   Three broad themes emerged from the interviews: 1) long-term goals, 2)
   flexibility, and 3) adaptive learning. Stocking-rate decisions appear to
   be slow, path-dependent choices that are shaped by broader social,
   economic, and political dynamics. Ranchers described having greater
   flexibility in altering grazing strategies than ranch-level, long-term,
   annual stocking rates. These results reflect the complexity of the
   social-ecological systems ranchers navigate in their adaptive
   decision-making processes. Ranch decision-making process diversity
   within these environments precludes development of a single ``best{''}
   strategy to manage livestock grazing. Published by Elsevier Inc. on

Title = {Machine learning to analyze the social-ecological impacts of natural
   resource policy: insights from community forest management in the Indian
   Himalaya},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Machine learning promises to advance analysis of the social and
   ecological impacts of forest and other natural resource policies around
   the world. However, realizing this promise requires addressing a number
   of challenges characteristic of the forest sector. Forests are complex
   social-ecological systems (SESs) with myriad interactions and feedbacks
   potentially linked to policy impacts. This complexity makes it hard for
   machine learning methods to distinguish between significant causal
   relationships and random fluctuations due to noise. In this context, SES
   frameworks together with quasi-experimental impact evaluation approaches
   can facilitate the use of machine learning by providing guidance on the
   choice of variables while reducing bias in estimated effects. Here we
   combine an SES framework, optimal matching, and Causal Tree-based
   algorithms to examine causal impacts of two community forest management
   policies (forest cooperatives and joint state-community partnerships) on
   vegetation growth in the Indian Himalaya. We find that neither policy
   had a major impact on average, but there was important heterogeneity in
   effects conditional on local contextual conditions. For joint forest
   management, a set of biophysical and climate factors shaped differential
   policy impacts across the study region. By contrast, cooperative forest
   management performed much better in locations where existing
   grazing-based livelihoods were safeguarded. Stronger local institutions
   and secure tenure under cooperative management explain the difference in
   outcomes between the two policies. Despite their potential, machine
   learning approaches do have limitations, including absence of valid
   precision estimates for heterogeneity estimates and issues of estimate
   stability. Therefore, they should be viewed as a complement to impact
   evaluation approaches that, among other potential uses, can uncover key
   drivers of heterogeneity and generate new questions and hypotheses to
   improve knowledge and policy relating to forest and other natural
   resource governance challenges.},

Title = {Market-based grazing land transfers and customary institutions in the
   management of rangelands: Two case studies on the Qinghai-Tibetan
   Plateau},
Journal = {LAND USE POLICY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {57},

Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {Beginning in the early 1990's, grazing lands once held in common were
   contracted to individual households in the rangeland regions of China.
   The resulting fragmentation of rangelands has led to ecological and
   social problems. As China seeks to address intractable poverty and
   rangeland degradation, attention has turned to rental, or transfer, of
   contracted grazing land as a market-based approach to re-aggregating
   grazing land into larger units that support economies of scale. However,
   given that many pastoral regions still maintain community customary
   institutions, what the relationship between market mechanisms and local
   customary institutions should be in rangeland management needs further
   analysis. This paper applies comparative case studies of two types of
   relationships between market mechanisms and customary institutions: (1)
   market mechanisms that replace customary institutions in the case of Axi
   village, and (2) market mechanisms that are embedded within customary
   institutions in Xiareer village. This allows contrast of the impacts of
   differing approaches on livelihoods, livestock production, and wealth
   differentiation among pastoral households. We found that there is a
   higher level of livestock mortality, lower livestock productivity, and
   higher livestock production cost in Axi Village compared to Xiareer
   Village. In addition, household asset levels are higher and there is
   less income differentiation in Xiareer Village. It is concluded that
   embedding market mechanisms within customary institutions has had
   notable benefits for the herders of Xiareer Village, because it is a
   better fit to the coupled pastoral social-ecological system. Based on
   these findings, we argue that in pastoral communities where the
   rangeland transfer system for contracted grazing land has not yet been
   implemented, it is critical to reconsider China's current policy
   approach to pay greater attention to the innovative management systems
   being developed in local regions. Instead of considering market-based
   approaches as oppositional to traditional institutions, options that
   derive from the interaction of market-based and customary institutions
   should be considered. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Linkages Under Urbanization of Pastoral Regions in China},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Month = {APR 9},
Abstract = {In contrast to agricultural settings, the process of urbanization in the
   pastoral regions of China are largely driven by long-term influences of
   ecological conservation and the provision of social services.
   Consequently, many of the herders who have migrated into nearby
   secondary urban centers depend on resources from pastoral regions to
   support their livelihoods, forming complex patterns of rural-urban
   linkages. While current literature has discussed the processes of herder
   out-migration and their implications on rural and urban livelihood
   development, few studies have examined the linkages between the herders
   living in the pastoral regions and those who have out-migrated to urban
   regions and their importance in rural livelihood transformation. Based
   on past studies, we argue that, in a changing pastoral social-ecological
   system, herders living in both rural and urban regions depend on each
   other to support their livelihoods through three types of mobility: (1)
   livestock mobility, (2) herder mobility, and (3) resource mobility.
   However, what innovative institutions in rangeland resource management
   and herder economic cooperation can do to help maintain these three
   types of mobility to sustain rural livelihood development, becomes a
   critical challenge. Innovative community cooperative institutions
   developed by pastoral communities from the Tibetan Plateau and Inner
   Mongolia may be able to offer new perspective and insight on how to
   better maintain rural-urban linkages in the processes of urbanization in
   pastoral regions. In this current study will present the two cases of
   innovative institutions and the roles they play in facilitating the
   three types of mobility to address livelihood challenges. While current
   studies recommend an increase of government subsidies, provision of
   vocational training, and social insurance that help herders better adapt
   to urban livelihood, we argue that rangeland management and community
   economic cooperation in innovative institutions are needed to facilitate
   the mobility of livestock, resources, and the herder population, and
   maybe only then the livelihood challenges that migrated herders are
   facing will be addressed effectively.},

Abstract = {Ecosystem services are benefits humans obtain as a result of ecosystem
   processes and conditions. In the western United States, public
   rangelands are managed for a spectrum of ecosystem services on behalf of
   multiple stakeholders. Decisions of ranchers who hold public land
   grazing allotments must balance operational needs for forage with
   societal expectations for other ecosystem services. To better understand
   their choices regarding ecosystem services, we interviewed ranchers to
   learn about the bases for their management decisions and identify
   services they believe rangelands provide. A total of 19 services were
   identified, many of which reflected ranchers recognition that they
   manage within the context of a broader social-ecological system (e.g.,
   maintaining open space). We then conducted a mail survey of Bureau of
   Land Management grazing permittees in six states to understand the
   importance they personally place on different services, as well as the
   extent to which they manage with those services in mind. Fourteen of the
   19 ecosystem services identified in interviews were reported by at least
   50\% of the survey sample (N = 435) as influencing their management
   decisions. Most respondents reported trying to manage deeded and leased
   land to the same standard. Aside from forage for livestock (ranked \#1),
   ranchers were less likely to report managing for provisioning services
   than for cultural, supporting, and regulating services. Importance
   ratings for ecosystem services followed a similar pattern, although
   there were a few differences in rank order. Ranchers tended to report
   managing for more ecosystem services if they had larger operations,
   earned at least 50\% of their income from ranching, spent more time out
   on the ranch, and relied on multiple sources for information about range
   management. Results indicate public land ranchers believe they are
   managing for multifunctionality, balancing their own operational needs
   with those of society. (C) 2019 The Society for Range Management.

Title = {Perceptions of Utah ranchers toward carbon sequestration: Policy
   implications for US rangelands},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {78-86},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {Enhanced carbon sequestration is one means to mitigate climate change.
   Rangelands are arid and semi-arid lands, typified by relatively low and
   variable levels of net primary productivity, where carbon sequestration
   might be increased via alterations in land management. Rangelands are
   vast in size and dominate the land area in the western US and worldwide.
   It has been estimated that privately owned rangelands in the US could
   sequester an additional 60 million tons of carbon annually, roughly
   equal to five percent of the US annual CO2 emissions. Ranchers are the
   target population that could implement changes in rangeland management
   to promote carbon sequestration, but little is known about how they
   might receive such programs. Therefore, for Utah, we conducted a
   combined mail and telephone survey of 495 randomly selected ranchers to
   assess their knowledge of and attitude toward carbon sequestration,
   possible benefits of carbon sequestration as perceived by ranchers, and
   factors influencing their likelihood of participating in carbon
   sequestration programs. Overall, despite that 70 percent of respondents
   had little or no self-reported knowledge about carbon sequestration, 63
   percent had negative views about it. Ranchers reporting the most
   knowledge also tended to have the most negative attitudes. The least
   important benefit that might accrue to ranchers from carbon
   sequestration was seen as climate change mitigation, while the most
   important benefit was improved land stewardship. Only four percent of
   respondents indicated an unconditional willingness to participate in
   carbon sequestration programs, but 71 percent could be interested
   depending on new information received. Before carbon sequestration
   programs are developed for rangelands, further research is needed to
   clarify why more knowledge of carbon sequestration can lead to greater
   skepticism of relevant programs. We respect this finding, as it may be
   based on well-founded rancher concerns such as technical or
   administrative efficacy. If such concerns can be overcome, extension
   efforts should be tailored to emphasize the ecological merits of carbon
   sequestration for rangeland management, which will facilitate the
   ability of ranchers to achieve their personal goals. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Anticipating, avoiding, and managing disruptive environmental change
   such as regime shifts and the impacts it has onhuman well-being is a key
   sustainability challenge. Woody encroachment is a globally important
   example of a regime shift that occursin savanna systems, where a large
   fraction of the world's poor live. Woody encroachment is known to
   negatively impact a variety ofecosystem services, but few studies have
   investigated the impact of woody encroachment on local land users and
   their livelihoods. Inthis study, we conducted semi-structured interviews
   to determine how different land users-local subsistence communities and
   managersof conservation tourism areas-perceive woody encroachment in the
   Hluhluwe region of South Africa, how it affects the ecosystemservices
   they rely upon, and what costs they incur in undertaking activities to
   reverse woody encroachment. Most interviewees perceivedtrees to be
   increasing in the landscape (83\%). However, perceptions about the
   causes of woody encroachment differed: communitymembers cited the
   reduced usage of trees as the reason for woody encroachment, whereas
   conservation managers mostly attributedthe change to increased CO2. Most
   community members felt woody encroachment was harmful to their household
   and general well-being, citing loss of grazing for livestock, and fear
   of attacks by wild animals and criminals as the main impacts. In
   contrast, conservationmanagers perceived woody encroachment to have both
   harmful and beneficial impacts, with the main negative impacts being
   loss ofgrazing for wildlife and impacts on tourism through reduced
   visibility for game viewing. All the conservation areas invested in
   treeclearing compared to only 20\% of respondents in the community
   areas, where an average of ZAR367 (US\$25) was spent per year
   onclearing, compared to ZAR293,751 (US\$20,000) and ZAR163,000
   (US\$11,000) spent in private game reserves and government
   reserves,respectively. Our findings highlight the negative impacts of
   ongoing woody encroachment, the differentiated impacts it has on
   differentland users, and differences in capacity to combat encroachment.
   These findings highlight the need for state-funded
   managementinterventions to support clearing of trees in encroached
   areas, particularly in communal areas},

Title = {The Three Creeks Allotment Consolidation: changing western federal

Volume = {12},

Month = {FAL},
Abstract = {The federal government owns approximately 47\% of all land in the
   western United States. In the state of Utah, about 64\% of the land base
   is managed by the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S.
   Forest Service (USFS). The government has historically issued permits to
   owners of private lands to allow the owners to graze their livestock on
   public lands. The permits (allotments) are generally of 10-year duration
   and allow for an annual season of use. In some cases, continued and
   repeated historical annual grazing practices may not be ideal for permit
   holders and their communities, nor for the semi-arid western rangelands,
   wildlife, and livestock. In 2010, a group of ranchers holding federal
   permits with help from employees of the Utah Department of Agriculture
   and Food's Grazing Improvement Program, along with the BLM and the USFS,
   reexamined longstanding cultural and management paradigms. They engaged
   in a watershed-scale planning effort that encompassed grazing, wildlife,
   water quality, habitat, recreation, legal, and policy issues. Most
   notably, the planning process addressed the social dynamics of working
   with 36 different grazing permittees representing 10 different grazing
   allotments, and multiple government agencies. The process and its
   results, both referred to hereafter as the Three Creeks Allotment
   Consolidation (TCAC), consolidated the allotments of the permittees,
   providing for a new company to be the permittee and to manage the lands.
   The TCAC process, in conjunction with private lands, seeks to improve
   rangeland, enhance ecosystem services, and provide for increased
   economic sustainability. In this paper, I describe a dynamic process
   that may have implications for changing how federal grazing allotments
   are managed in the future. Specifically, I emphasize the role and
   importance of managing human dimensions when implementing grazing
   policies that blend public and private resources.},

   institutional innovations: two case study villages from Guinan County of
   Qinghai Province, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The privatization of collectively used rangelands results in
   fragmentation of land use in pastoral areas. This affects pastoralists'
   grazing strategies and results in new institutional arrangements for
   addressing changing social-ecological systems. Two main systems of
   grazing management have emerged in the pastoral regions of the
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau that offer new perspectives on addressing
   rangeland fragmentation. One allows the renting of parcels of allocated
   grazing land to or from others (RTS) and is based on having fenced
   contracted parcels for each household. The other is a community-based
   grazing quota system (GQS) in which a grazing use quota is allocated to
   each household, while the community maintains collective use of the
   rangeland. We compare two case study villages implementing these two
   different management systems, operating across household and community
   scales, and analyze vegetation composition, above-ground biomass, and
   soil properties as indicators of impacts. Transects reveal that
   above-ground biomass was higher under the RTS than under the GQS, but
   species composition shifted to dominance by non-palatable forbs and
   graminoids. The RTS grasslands had lower carbon and nitrogen density
   compared to GQS-managed grasslands. These differences are consistent
   with the herder's perceptions of ecological changes. The general
   improvement of rangeland conditions under the GQS may be linked to
   greater herd mobility and the control of livestock numbers through the
   establishment of community-enforced grazing quotas. Mobility under the
   RTS is limited to a few parcels, and local regulation of stocking rates
   is minimal because the system relies on external intervention. The case
   of GQS suggests that addressing rangeland fragmentation with improved
   vegetation conditions requires institutions operating at both household
   and community scales allowing for mobility and regulation of stocking
   rates.},

   Another objective was to clarify how grazing is managed during drought
   on federal lands. Fourteen tactics studied included management of water,
   forage, herds, and finances and access to information and government
   programs. Data collection included surveys of 429 ranchers and
   interviews of seven federal employees. Data analysis used descriptive
   statistics and logistic regression. Results indicated that 3,133
   non-adoption decisions were heavily dominated by the perceived
   incompatibility between tactics and operational needs; producer
   situations may often be misunderstood by experts. Weather forecasting
   tools were typically regarded by ranchers as ``too complex,{''} while
   Extension information was often viewed as ``not useful.{''} Factors
   promoting drought preparedness included having a strong
   livestock-business orientation or a drought-planning mentality. Factors
   hindering drought preparedness were dominated by advancing rancher age.
   Grazing permittees benefit from federal drought early-warning systems,
   yet herd adjustments on allotments were rare during the 2019 drought,
   pushing forage utilization to the limits. While challenges appear
   daunting, there are opportunities to enhance drought preparedness,
   prominently including creative efforts to promote more education and
   mentoring on operational drought management. Comprehensive,
   user-friendly drought websites remain rare, yet they can be vital hubs
   for stakeholders. Such websites must meet diverse communication needs
   including a greater focus on information requirements of seniors.
   Drought policies for ranchers should: (1) Eliminate perverse incentives
   that foster inappropriate risk taking; (2) reward pro-active,
   risk-management behaviors; and (3) facilitate recruitment of a younger,
   innovative cohort of new producers. Updating federal management plans
   could support grazing adjustments that incorporate more grass banking.
   Unified drought-response guidelines could harmonize agency approaches.

Title = {Comparison of social-ecological resilience between two grassland

Abstract = {Embraced for decision-making, resilience has evolved as a meaningful
   term in areas such as ecology, the economy and society. After a policy
   of grassland contracts was implemented on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau,
   two grassland management patterns evolved: the multi-household
   management pattern (MMP) and the single-household management pattern
   (SMP). Within a resilience-driven perspective, this study compared the
   outcomes of these grassland management patterns by measuring their
   effects on the resilience of grazing, ecological, economic and social
   systems. Resilience indicators for each of the four systems were:
   grazing system (grazing space, transhumance, water source and
   reproduction); ecological system (vegetation including cover, biomass,
   species richness and soil properties including pH, organic carbon, total
   nitrogen and total phosphorus); economic system (income, expenditure and
   infrastructure) and the social system (health, assistance, social
   relations, cultural inheritance and institutional arrangements). In
   order to provide a social-ecological resilience framework for the two
   grassland management patterns, a decision support tool was applied to
   approximately gauge the resilience of each indicator. The results showed
   that each of the four systems under the MMP had a greater degree of
   resilience than the SMP, and that the overall resilience of the MMP was
   estimated at 5.8 units compared to about - 5.8 units for the SMP. The
   relative success of the MMP was seen to rest largely on the maintenance
   of traditional management practices, social networks, trust and the low
   cost and high efficiency of informal institutions, which acted to reduce
   the risk of unsustainable development of ecological and social systems.
   The important take-home lesson from this study is that contracting of
   grasslands to private entities on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and in
   the rest of the world where similar land management practices exist,
   must be undertaken with caution.},

Title = {Challenges, solutions and research priorities for sustainable rangelands},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {42},
Number = {5},
Pages = {359-373},
Abstract = {Australia's rangeland communities, industries, and environment are under
   increasing pressures from anthropogenic activities and global changes
   more broadly. We conducted a horizon scan to identify and prioritise key
   challenges facing Australian rangelands and their communities, and
   outline possible avenues to address these challenges, with a particular
   focus on research priorities. We surveyed participants of the Australian
   Rangeland Society 20th Biennial Conference, held in Canberra in
   September 2019, before the conference and in interactive workshops
   during the conference, in order to identify key challenges, potential
   solutions, and research priorities. The feedback was broadly grouped
   into six themes associated with supporting local communities, managing
   natural capital, climate variability and change, traditional knowledge,
   governance, and research and development. Each theme had several
   sub-themes and potential solutions to ensure positive, long-term
   outcomes for the rangelands. The survey responses made it clear that
   supporting `resilient and sustainable rangelands that provide cultural,
   societal, environmental and economic outcomes simultaneously' is of
   great value to stakeholders. The synthesis of survey responses combined
   with expert knowledge highlighted that sustaining local communities in
   the long term will require that the inherent social, cultural and
   natural capital of rangelands are managed sustainably, particularly in
   light of current and projected variability in climate. Establishment of
   guidelines and approaches to address these challenges will benefit from:
   (i) an increased recognition of the value and contributions of
   traditional knowledge and practices; (ii) development of better
   governance that is guided by and benefits local stakeholders; and (iii)
   more funding to conduct and implement strong research and development
   activities, with research focused on addressing critical knowledge gaps
   as identified by the local stakeholders. This requires strong governance
   with legislation and policies that work for the rangelands. We provide a
   framework that indicates the key knowledge gaps and how innovations may
   be implemented and scaled out, up and deep to achieve the resilience of
   Australia's rangelands. The same principles could be adapted to address
   challenges in rangelands on other continents, with similar beneficial
   outcomes.},

Abstract = {Rangelands of the western Great Plains of North America are complex
   social-ecological systems where management objectives for livestock
   production, grassland bird conservation, and vegetation structure and
   composition converge. The Collaborative Adaptive Rangeland Management
   (CARM) experiment is a 10-year collaborative adaptive management (CAM)
   project initiated in 2012 that is aimed at fostering science-management
   partnerships and data-driven rangeland management through a
   participatory. multistakeholder approach. This study evaluates the
   decision-making process that emerged from the first 4 yr of CARM. Our
   objectives were to 1) document how diverse stakeholder experiences,
   epistemologies, and resulting knowledge contributed to the CARM project,
   2) evaluate how coproduced knowledge informed management decision making
   through three grazing seasons, and 3) explore the implications of
   participation in the CARM project for rangeland stakeholders. We
   evaluated management decision making as representatives from government
   agencies and conservation non-governmental organizations, ranchers, and
   interdisciplinary researchers worked within the CARM experiment to 1)
   prioritize desired ecosystem services; 2) determine objectives; 3) set
   stocking rates, criteria for livestock movement among pastures, and
   vegetation treatments; and 4) select monitoring techniques that would
   inform decision making. For this paper, we analyzed meeting transcripts,
   interviews, and focus group data related to stakeholder group decision
   making. We find two key lessons from the CARM project. First, the CAM
   process makes visible, but does not reconcile differences between,
   stakeholder experiences and ways of knowing about complex rangeland
   systems. Second, social learning in CAM is contingent on the development
   of trust among stakeholder and researcher groups. We suggest future CAM
   efforts should 1) make direct efforts to share and acknowledge managers'
   different rangeland management experiences, epistemologies, and
   knowledge and 2) involve long-term research commitment in time and
   funding to social, as well as experimental, processes that promote trust
   building among stakeholders and researchers over time. Published by

Title = {Resilience applied to farming: organic farmers' perspectives},
Journal = {ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The increasingly uncertain and changing agricultural context raises
   questions about the resilience, i.e., ability to cope with disturbances,
   of farms to climate change and other disturbances. To date, the
   resilience concept has been discussed mainly in the scientific field
   leading to an abundant literature on social-ecological system resilience
   and on livelihood resilience. A farm resilience framework is developing
   and borrows from those two frameworks. However, consistent application
   of the farm resilience concept remains difficult and requires better
   consideration of farmers' perspectives. Our objectives in this study
   were to highlight farmers' perceptions of farm resilience to the variety
   of disturbances they have to cope with in their daily farm management
   and to highlight resilience factors. We conducted 128 semistructured
   interviews on French organic dairy cattle (85) and sheep (43) farms. We
   asked farmers six open-ended questions about resilience in organic dairy
   farming. Inductive content analysis of the data was conducted. According
   to farmers, a resilient farm relies on a high degree of autonomy in
   investments, animal feeding, and decision making, and is economically
   efficient. Other resilience indicators include consistency of the
   farming plan, with, e.g., herd size corresponding to the production
   potential of the land, and transferability of the farm to relatives,
   through, e.g., the financial capital required to take over the farm.
   Farmers also highlighted different ways to achieve resilience. Because
   of the higher cost of organic inputs, converting to organic farming
   indirectly promotes adaptations of farms toward autonomy and economic
   efficiency, and is thus regarded as a major resilience factor. Farmers
   also highlighted the central role of pastures and grazing to achieve
   autonomy and improve cost control. Diversification within the farm via
   crop rotations, herd composition, and farm products was also considered
   to improve farm resilience. In this study, we are the first to explore
   organic farmers' perception of farm resilience. Better understanding
   farmers' perceptions is necessary for developing training and advisory
   programs to support farm resilience to a variety of disturbances.},

Title = {Livestock-Mediated Dispersal of <i>Prosopis juliflora</i> Imperils

Abstract = {Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC is a woody plant from the Americas that has
   dispersed worldwide via human intervention. Typically introduced with
   good intentions, Prosopis often proliferates and degrades native
   ecosystems. Prosopis first appeared in the Allideghi Wildlife Reserve
   (AWR) of northeastern Ethiopia in 1997. In 2005-2006 we determined: (1)
   patterns of Prosopis dispersal and establishment using
   global-positioning system mapping and seed-bank assessments; (2) impacts
   of Prosopis on cover composition and species richness of grassland
   vegetation using transects at replicated Prosopis stands that varied by
   tree size; and (3) attitudes of local people toward Prosopis using focus
   groups and interviews. Prosopis seeds first arrived in the AWR after
   pastoral livestock consumed seedpods along the Awash River, some 50 km
   away. Seeds have been deposited in corrals at recently established
   pastoral settlements within the AWR, and saplings now sprout along
   livestock trails. Prosopis has also colonized the AWR core grassland
   area, a vital habitat for wild grazers. Compared with sites lacking
   Prosopis, the largest class of Prosopis significantly reduced understory
   basal cover for perennial grasses from 68\% to 2\%, increased soil
   surface exposure from 30\% to 80\%, and lowered the number of grass
   species from seven to two. Attitudes of pastoralists toward Prosopis
   have become more negative over time. Local communities use Prosopis via
   limited charcoal production with some grinding of the seedpods for
   livestock feed. Infested sites are cleared by hand, but control has been
   ineffective. Because pastoral livestock are the main vectors for
   Prosopis seed dispersal and facilitate establishment, they will help
   transform the core of the AWR ecosystem from open grassland to denuded
   Prosopis woodland. While this bodes ill for grazing animals in general,
   it has particularly negative implications for the survival of an
   isolated population of an endangered, grass-dependent species-Grevy's
   zebra (Equus grevyi). (C) 2015 Society for Range Management. Published

Title = {`This country just hangs tight': perspectives on managing land
   degradation and climate change in far west NSW},
Journal = {RANGELAND JOURNAL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {41},
Number = {3},
Pages = {197-210},
Abstract = {Discussions of land degradation often display a disconnect between
   global and local scales. Although global-scale discussions often focus
   on measuring and reversing land degradation through metrics and policy
   measures, local-scale discussions can highlight a diversity of
   viewpoints and the importance of local knowledge and context-specific
   strategies for sustainable land management. Similarly, although
   scientific studies clearly link anthropogenic climate change to land
   degradation as both cause and consequence, the connection may not be so
   clear for local rangelands communities due to the complex temporal and
   spatial scales of change and management in such environments. In
   research conducted in October 2015, we interviewed 18 stakeholders in
   the far west of New South Wales about their perspectives on sustainable
   land management. The results revealed highly variable views on what
   constitutes land degradation, its causes and appropriate responses. For
   the pastoral land managers, the most important sign of good land
   management was the maintenance of groundcover, through the management of
   total grazing pressure. Participants viewed overgrazing as a contributor
   to land degradation in some cases and they identified episodes of land
   degradation in the region. However, other more contentious factors were
   also highlighted, such as wind erosion, grazing by goats and kangaroos
   and the spread of undesired invasive native scrub' at the expense of
   more desirable pasture, and alternative views that these can offer
   productive benefits. Although few participants were concerned about
   anthropogenic climate change, many described their rangeland management
   styles as adaptive to the fluctuations of the climate, regardless of the
   reasons for these variations. Rather than focusing on whether
   landholders believe in' climate change or agree on common definitions or
   measurement approaches for land degradation, these results suggest that
   their culture of adaptation may provide a strong basis for coping with
   an uncertain future. The culture of adaption developed through managing
   land in a highly variable climate may help even if the specific
   conditions that landholders need to adapt to are unlike those
   experienced in living memory. Such an approach requires scientific and
   expert knowledge to be integrated alongside the context-specific
   knowledge, values and existing management strategies of local
   stakeholders.},

Title = {Spatial variation in the functional characteristics of herbivorous fish
   communities and the resilience of coral reefs},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {174-188},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Many ecosystems face degradation unless factors that underpin their
   resilience can be effectively managed. In tropical reef ecosystems,
   grazing by herbivorous fishes can prevent coral-macroalgal phase shifts
   that commonly signal loss of resilience. However, knowledge of grazing
   characteristics that most promote resilience is typically experimental,
   localized, and sparse, which limits broad management applications.
   Applying sound ecological theory to broad-scale data may provide an
   alternative basis for ecosystem management. We explore the idea that
   resilience is positively related to the diversity within and among
   functional groups of organisms. Specifically, we infer the relative
   vulnerability of different subregions of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to
   phase shifts based on functional characteristics of the local
   herbivorous fish communities. Reef slopes on 92 reefs set in three zones
   of the continental shelf in eight latitudinal sectors of the GBR were
   surveyed on multiple occasions between 1995 and 2009. Spatial variation
   in fish community structure was high and driven primarily by shelf
   position. Measures of functional diversity, functional redundancy, and
   abundance were generally higher offshore and lower inshore. Two turbid
   inshore subregions were considered most vulnerable based on very low
   measures of herbivore function, and this was supported by the occurrence
   of phase shifts within one of three subregions. Eleven reefs that
   resisted phase shifts after major coral mortality included some with
   very low measures of herbivore function. The fact that phase shifts did
   not necessarily occur when large herbivores were scarce indicates that
   other environmental factors compensated to preserve resilience.
   Estimates of vulnerability based solely on herbivore function may thus
   prove conservative, but caution is appropriate, since compensatory
   factors are largely unknown and could be eroded unwittingly by
   anthropogenic stresses. Our data suggest that managing the threat of
   phase shifts in coral reef ecosystems successfully will require
   spatially explicit strategies that consider both the functional
   characteristics of local herbivore communities and environmental factors
   that may raise or lower resilience thresholds. A strong positive
   correlation between water clarity and the species richness and abundance
   of herbivorous fishes suggests that management of water quality is of
   generic importance to ensure the ecosystem services of this important
   group of herbivores.},

Title = {Vulnerability assessment of the multi-sector North American bison
   <i>Bison</i> <i>bison</i> management system to climate change},
Journal = {PEOPLE AND NATURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Pages = {711-722},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {1. Bison Bison bison are a keystone of a conservation system, but that
   system is vulnerable to the effects of a changing climate projected to
   alter land use through the 21st century.
   2. The current bison population of North America is approximately
   400,000 animals and is maintained by a self-assembled bison management
   system (BMS) of various stakeholders focused on bison conservation and
   production. The BMS is comprised of public, for-profit private, Tribal
   and not-for-profit non-governmental organization (NGO) sectors, with
   complementary values, attitudes and practices that contribute to a
   robust conservation footprint for the species.
   3. Currently, the majority of grasslands (90\%) and bison (85\%) are
   privately owned which justifies the need for robust private land
   conservation strategies to maintain this iconic species and its
   grassland habitats.
   4. We assessed vulnerability of the BMS to 21st century consequences of
   climate change with a vulnerability scoping diagram that emphasizes
   exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, as well as environmental
   values, attitudes and practices. We surveyed 132 bison managers within
   both the private and public/NGO sectors. Respondents were predominantly
   educated white males located in the northern and central mixed grass
   prairies who manage bison herds of, on average, 51-100 animals.
   5. Overall, the BMS is moderately vulnerable to climate change. While
   the public/NGO and private sectors differ in adaptive capacity,
   specifically in measures of information exchange, external revenue, use
   of management plans and access to grazing leases, the sectors act as
   partners for exchanging bison and rely on sustained interchange of
   bison; dimensions of exposure and sensitivity appear similar between
   public/NGO and private sectors.
   6. The complementary, shared environmental values and attitudes of the
   private and public/NGO sectors shape the foundation for enhanced
   collaboration among the multi-sector BMS. But it is the sharing of
   diverse practices and respective consequences that will lead the BMS to
   discover credible, scalable adaptive solutions to climate change. This
   may lead to the bison community to decide whether to form a `bison
   coalition' to seek solutions to adapt to climate change.},

Abstract = {Pastoral systems are known to be prone to social, political and
   ecological uncertainties. Traditional ecological knowledge that the
   pastoral communities hold around their bio-physical environment has been
   a key to cope with stressors and adapt to the rapid socio-economic
   changes. We examined traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) on livestock
   and resource management, factors influencing livestock production and
   concurrent changes in an agro-pastoral system. We used mixed methods by
   conducting 44 semi-structured interviews, 10 key informants' interviews
   and resource mapping in five villages of Upper Spiti Landscape, western
   Himalaya. Our specific objectives were to (i) document TEK on livestock
   diet and management and (ii) understand the drivers and consequences of
   the change in the agro-pastoral society and associated traditional
   knowledge system. The herders of the study area possessed extensive
   knowledge of livestock diet and fodder species preference. They used
   this knowledge to optimize livestock grazing in pastures during summers
   and to fulfil the nutrient requirements of livestock species during
   stall feeding in winters. Seasonally, the aspect, altitude and
   accessibility of the pasture influenced the rotational use of pastures.
   In contrast, the quality of forage and water availability, distance of
   the pasture from village and threats from predators influenced the
   selection of grazing areas daily. There are evident changes in the
   livestock production system and signs that TEK is eroding in the region.
   Primary contributing factors to loss of TEK include changing aspirations
   of local people. These aspirations were related to employment in
   lucrative alternative options like cash crops and tourism, out-migration
   of the young generation for higher education and the arrival of
   immigrant labourers as new actors in livestock management. Livestock
   numbers in the study site remained dynamic between the year 2003-2016
   owing to the substantive social and ecological changes. Our results
   suggest that while the traditional knowledge persists, the signs of
   erosion in traditional knowledge and associated changes in current
   herding practices are evident. We argue that recent changes in the
   pastoral social-ecological system, especially loss of TEK and
   non-traditional rearing practices, due to increasing dependence on
   immigrant labourers, may have negative implications for livestock
   production, rangeland health and wildlife conservation goals in the long
   run. Long term site-specific studies on livestock production and
   associated knowledge would be critical for adaptive rangeland management
   and policies.},

   marketing, social conflict, and pastoral livelihoods. The six study
   sites differ with respect to human and livestock population dynamics and
   the resulting pressures on natural resources. Environmental degradation,
   however, has been commonly observed. Climate change is also having
   diverse systemic effects often related to increasing aridity. As
   rangelands become more economically developed pastoral livelihoods may
   diversify, food security can improve, and commercial livestock
   production expands, but wealth stratification widens. Some significant
   upgrades in rural infrastructure and public service delivery have
   occurred; telecommunications are markedly improved overall due to
   widespread adoption of mobile phones. Pressures from grazing, farming,
   mining, and other land uses-combined with drought-can ignite local
   conflicts over resources, although the intensity and scope of conflicts
   markedly varies across our case-study sites. Pastoralists and their
   herds have become more sedentary overall due to many factors, and this
   can undermine traditional risk-management tactics based on mobility.
   Remote rangelands still offer safe havens for insurgents, warlords, and
   criminals especially in countries where policing remains weak; the
   resulting civil strife can undermine commerce and public safety. There
   has been tremendous growth in knowledge concerning developing-country
   rangelands since 1990, but this has not often translated into improved
   environmental stewardship or an enhanced wellbeing for rangeland
   dwellers. Some examples of demonstrable impact are described, and these
   typically have involved longer-term investments in capacity building for
   pastoralists, local professionals, and other stakeholders. Research is
   shifting from ecologically centered to more human-centered issues;
   traditional academic approaches are often being augmented with
   participatory, community-based engagement. Building human or social
   capital in ways that are integrated with improved natural resource
   stewardship offers the greatest returns on research investment. Our
   future research and outreach priorities include work that fortifies
   pastoral governance, enhances livelihoods for a diverse array of
   rangeland residents, and improves land and livestock management in a
   comprehensive social-ecological systems approach.},

Title = {Drivers of change in mountain agriculture: A thirty-year analysis of
   trajectories of evolution of cattle farming systems in the Spanish
   Pyrenees},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Mountain regions are characterized by complex interrelations between
   human and natural systems. Political and socioeconomic drivers at
   various scales affect mountain farming systems functioning, resulting in
   farm structural changes (management, structure and economic
   performance). Longitudinal studies help fully understand the dynamics of
   these systems, identify their main drivers of change, and prepare for
   foreseeable future events. This study aimed to (i) analyse the main
   changes of cattle farming systems in the Pyrenees from 1990 to 2018,
   (ii) identify the different trajectories of farm evolution and (iii) to
   determine the key drivers of those trajectories at global, regional and
   household levels. We monitored 50 cattle farms in three valleys with
   different socioeconomic contexts, which were surveyed in 1990, 2004 and
   2018. We observed clear changes regarding land and labour production
   factors. Over the 1990-2004 period, farming systems experienced a land
   use extensification (one-month increase of grazing season) and capital
   intensification (55\% increase of livestock units (LU) per work unit
   (WU)) processes, coinciding with a switch from dairy to beef farming
   with on-farm fattening. Over the 2004-2018 period, land use stabilised
   but the capital intensification process went on (17\% increase of LU/WU)
   while farms reduced their inputs (43\% decrease of feeding costs per
   LU), in parallel to the decreasing importance of fattening. These
   changes allowed to globally maintain stable farm economic margins
   (around 40,000 Euro/WU). Multivariate statistical analyses enabled to
   identify four trajectories of evolution, three of them specific to each
   valley under study and a common across-valleys trajectory. These
   trajectories resulted from the interaction between global and regional
   drivers and household particularities. The CAP played a major role at
   the global level (representing an average of 70\% of farm gross margin
   in 2004 and 2018), while tourism development and household
   characteristics were the main drivers at the regional level. Several
   farms responded by maximising their output related to the most limiting
   production factor (i.e. agriculture land or labour) in each valley.
   However, the across-valleys trajectory, which comprised 44\% of farms,
   showed limited changes during the studied period. The ability of farms
   to maintain their adaptation capacity while keeping economic and social
   viability will determine the future of cattle farming in the region. Our
   findings highlight the need of reorienting agricultural policies towards
   promoting new entrants into mountain farming, better integrating CAP
   instruments with other EU sectorial policies and improving farm
   monitoring by disaggregating follow-up processes by agroecosystem and
   management regimes.},
